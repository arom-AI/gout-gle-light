The county specializes in relatively inexpensive cabernet sauvignons and sauvignon blancs that offer some impressive and serviceable options. A standout is Six Sigma's Cuvée Diamond Mine, a blend of cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo.\n\nOther notable vineyards and wineries include:\n- **Lille Langtry** - Planted the hillsides in the 1880s, with the vineyards ultimately becoming part of the Langtry Estate & Vineyard.\n- **Steele Wines** - Owned by Jed Steele, a well-known and highly respected winemaker. Steele Wines is known for pioneering the Kendall-Jackson style of soft, round, easy-drinking chardonnay in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nUnder brands like Steele and Shooting Star, Steele produces approximately fifty different wines from diverse varieties such as aligoté and counoise, as well as well-priced old-vine zinfandels.\n\n**Mendocino Vineyards** - Surrounded by 90 smaller wineries and about 345 grape growers, Mendocino's 17,000 acres of vineyards (6,880 hectares) focus chiefly on chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, with some emerging offerings of pinot noir.\n\nOther notable producers in Mendocino include:\n- **Roederer Estate** - Known for producing some of California's most stunning, complex sparkling wines.\n- **Germain-Robin** - Recognized for crafting what is considered the finest brandy in the United States.\n  \nMendocino is also highlighted for its commitment to organic farming, with a large percentage of vineyards being farmed organically.\n\n---\n\nThis summary brings out the key details regarding vineyard acreage, notable vineyards, wine styles, and geographical highlights discussed in the document."

Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n### Topics Covered\n1. **Composed Salads**\n   - Recommendation: Medium-weight Carignan wines are good with salads that combine protein (such as chicken or smoked poultry) and peppery greens like arugula.\n\n2. **Chocolate**\n   - Recommendation: Carignan wine pairs well with everything from a simple flourless chocolate cake to a plum tart with dark chocolate. However, avoid heavy, creamier sweets.\n\n3. **Array of Cheeses**\n   - Note: Opt for opulent plum and berry fruit Carignan wines. Pair with a plate of cheese, crusty bread, and dried figs.\n\n4. **Carignan Wine Pairing Guidelines**\n   - With meat: Goes well with haute cuisine, roasted poultry, and mild cheeses.\n   - Avoid: Most fish and very spicy-hot foods due to the mismatch in flavors and the exaggeration of wine tannins.\n   - Less successful: Fresh white and yellow stone fruits like peaches and nectarines, unless creatively incorporated with elements like chocolate.\n\n### Cheese Recommendations\nThe document describes an ideal cheese plate to accompany Carignan wine, categorized by the type of cheese:\n\n| Type        | Cheeses                                       |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Semi-Hard   | Mahón (Spain), Petit Basque (France)          |\n| Hard        | Mimolette (France), Parmesan (Italy)          |\n| Blue        | Cabrales (Spain), Cambozola (Germany)—dessert wines |\n| Washed-Rind | Beaufort (France), Red Hawk (U.S.A.)          |\n\nThis structured approach highlights the preferences and recommendations while pairing Carignan wine with various foods, particularly emphasizing suitable cheese types to enhance the tasting experience."

Here's the structured content of the document summarizing and interpreting the key points:\n\n### Title: Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n#### Mosel Region\n- **Key Factors**: Aspect and slope are crucial for determining fruit quality in Mosel.\n- **Geography**: Discusses areas of Kaiserstuhl and Tuniberg opposite Colmar in Alsace.\n- **Features**: The south-facing slopes of the Kaiserstuhl (an extinct volcano) are highlighted for leveraging available warmth, boosting the reputation for high-quality Spätburgunder, commonly planted along with substantial plantings of Müller-Thurgau, Grauburgunder, Weißburgunder, and Riesling. GG wines from these regions incorporate a range of white and black varieties.\n\n#### Franken Region \n- **Primary Wine**: Unlike other regions in Germany, here Riesling isn't the most widely planted nor considered the most prestigious. Silvaner takes the spotlight in Franken.\n- **Climate Challenges**: Silvaner, being susceptible to frost damage, is planted in the warmest sites.\n- **Wine Characteristics**: The wines produced are distinctive for their concentration rarely found elsewhere in Germany, described as dry with an earthy quality, and rich on the palate.\n- **Packaging**: Bottled in distinctive flask-shaped bottles.\n- **Wine Varieties**: GG wines in this region can include Silvaner, Riesling, Weißburgunder, Grauburgunder, or Spätburgunder.\n\nThe document features an image showing a steep hillside vineyard, illustrating the discussed geographical and climatic factors that influence wine quality."

Even though high-tannin wines literally “dry out” the mouth, we don’t call them **dry wines**. Instead, that term is reserved to describe the absence of sweetness in wine. So we’re left groping for other words to describe tannin’s drying effects. We might describe a juicy Shiraz or other wine with mild tannin as “soft,” “velvety,” or “plush.” Wines with stronger tannin might be called “firm” or “structured,” or in extreme cases even overtly “tannic” or “tight,” as with young Cabernet Sauvignon. In a strangely appropriate metaphor, tannin character may be referred to as “grip,” and sometimes it really does feel like the wine has taken hold of the flesh in your mouth and won’t let go.\n\n---\n\n**Source:** Wine Secrets, page 68"

Variations of the word refer to different forms of travel or evening food in various parts of Belgium and France.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n- Early meringues might have significantly differed from their dense predecessors due to the process discoveries in the region of Artois and Picardie, involving thorough beating of eggs with some form of new technology like the straw whisk.\n\nThe discussion highlights the flexible nature of egg foams when creating different textures and the cultural and historical significance of meringues in European culinary practices."

    "contenu": "### EVERYDAY EQUIPMENT FOR MEASURING DRINKS\n\nIndividual drinks are usually measured with jiggers. The jigger set I like to use consists of two vessels, each a double cone. They follow the convention of the 30 milliliter “ounce.” The larger of the two jiggers, which I use for measuring anything between 1 and 2 ounces, has a 2-ounce cone with markings inside for 1½ ounces and a 1-ounce cone with markings inside for 3/4 ounce. The smaller jigger has a ¾-ounce cone with a ½-ounce internal line and a ½-ounce cone with a ¼-ounce internal line. These two jiggers are all you need for most measurements. If you are measuring to an internal line in the jigger, **pour all the way to the line**. If you are measuring to the top of the jigger, pour all the way to the top. People tend to underpour when they are measuring a full jigger. Tip: have your jigger over your mixing vessel as you pour to prevent yourself from spilling precious, precious booze.\n\n---\n\n**Three jiggers and a graduated cylinder. Surprisingly, all three jiggers have the same volume. Because it is narrower, the tall one in back is much more accurate. The jigger in front is more accurate than the one on the left because its sides are straight near the top. The graduated cylinder is a paragon of accuracy.**\n\nGiven a choice between tall, skinny jiggers and short, squat jiggers, I always choose the tall. They are far more accurate. A pour that’s a millimeter higher or lower in a wide jigger constitutes a much larger error than it does in a skinny jigger. The same principle applies to the next piece of equipment I recommend you acquire: a graduated cylinder."

Des mesures sont prises pour la qualité organoleptique du vin (éviter les défauts aromatiques) ainsi que pour garantir la sécurité du consommateur (substances allergènes ou toxiques). Le Code de la Consommation oblige à la conformité du produit : le metteur en marché doit justifier des vérifications et contrôles effectués aux autorités (Article L411-1, 1985).\n\n- **La conformité du produit**\n\n  La conformité est relative à une norme ou une réglementation. La méthode HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) consiste tout au long des étapes de production, à analyser les dangers, identifier les Points Critiques de Contrôle (CCP), fixer un seuil critique par CCP, établir un système de surveillance par CCP, établir des mesures correctives, vérifier et valider le plan HACCP. Des dangers sont également exogènes à l'exploitation, donc non maîtrisables par l'exploitant. Il peut s'agir de molécules issues des matériaux fournis, telles que la TCA des bouchons. Tous les matériaux en contact avec le produit sont aptes au contact alimentaire (Règlement (CE) n°1935/2004, 2004). Les dangers sont d’ordre chimique (présence de résidus d’intrants agricoles), physique (présence de matériaux) et biologique (mycotoxine). Le contrôle des risques s'effectue de façon continue, par échantillonnage ou de façon aléatoire selon leur fréquence et leur niveau de gravité. Un plan HACCP n’est pas formulé au domaine mais des dispositions sont toutefois prises pour minimiser les risques. Des mesures préventives (1), la mise en place de procédures/systèmes qui permettent de maîtriser le risque (2), la connaissance des limites critiques (3), le recours à des actions correctives (4), la tenue de documents associés (traçabilité et bulletins œnologiques) (5) (Delabre, 2022a).

    "contenu": "The provided document discusses the characteristics of Prosecco, a type of wine, particularly in terms of aging, food pairing, and its comparison with Champagne. Here is the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n**1. Aging and Sweetness of Prosecco:**\n   - Exception cases: Valdo’s Numero 10 and Bellanda's SC 1931 are exceptions where aging enhances the wine's primary-fruit character.\n   - Common practice: Most Prosecco is enjoyed young as aging the wine typically only enhances its primary-fruit character.\n   - Sweetness levels: Prosecco comes in three categories of sweetness - brut (driest), extra dry, and dry, with some overlap in sugar levels among these categories.\n\n**2. Characteristics and Consumption:**\n   - Freshness: Prosecco is best enjoyed fresh due to the fruitiness and freshness of its flavor.\n   - No need for vintage-dated cases: Due to the usual absence of single harvest vintages and quick market requirements, there's seldom a need to store vintage-dated Prosecco.\n   - Value proposition: It is usually more affordable and made quickly available, challenging the assumption that older wines are always better or more valuable.\n\n**3. Pairing with Food:**\n   - Compatibility with local cuisine: Prosecco pairs well with specialties from the Veneto region, like wild game, spit- or oven-roasted foods, polenta, and local mushrooms (porcini or cepes) and chestnuts.\n   - Suggested pairings: Ideal with snacks and a variety of foods such as roasted almonds, Chex Mix, and basic sushi to more complex dishes like crab and shrimp salads to Chinese potstickers.\n   - Comparative advantage: Unlike Champagne, which is about toast and chalk flavors from autolysis, Prosecco focuses more on the balance of ripe fruit and sweetness, making it more food-friendly.\n\n**4. Comparison to Champagne:**\n   - Price perception: Prosecco is often seen as a more affordable alternative to Champagne, though it shares some bubbly characteristics and food-friendliness.\n   - Flavor profile: Champagne typically exhibits a more complex flavor profile due to secondary fermentation, while Prosecco is appreciated for its straightforward ripe fruit and sweetness.\n\nThis text not only provides insights into how Prosecco differs from Champagne but also highlights how it is integrated culturally and gastronomically in its region of origin."

Here’s the structured content broken down by key sections and points:\n\n---\n\n### Aging and Flavor Development in Meat\n\n1. **Meat Aging Process**:\n   - Different meats like chicken, pork, and lamb benefit from aging. Pork and lamb can age for a week, enhancing flavor and texture.\n   - For pork and poultry, quick rancidity due to unsaturated fats is noted.\n\n2. **Optimal Conditions for Aging**:\n   - Best when meat is dry-aged around 34-38°F (1-3°C) with a humidity of 70-80%.\n   - These conditions inhibit microbial growth while allowing the meat to lose moisture slowly, becoming denser and more concentrated.\n\n### Role of Muscle Enzymes\n\n1. **Flavor Generation Through Enzymes**:\n   - Muscle enzymes play a crucial role in enhancing flavor post-slaughter by breaking down proteins into flavorful fragments.\n   - End products include savory amino acids, ATP, and aromatic fatty acids contributing to the meat's flavor.\n\n2. **Tenderness Enhancement**:\n   - Enzymes like calpains and cathepsins play roles in tenderizing meat.\n   - Calpains mainly weaken muscle structure supporting filaments, while cathepsins break down proteins and collagen, making the meat succulent.\n\n### Implications of Cooking and Storage\n\n1. **Cooking Impact**:\n   - High heat can denature enzymes, accelerating or slowing the aging process during cooking.\n   - Methods like searing or braising can enhance this effect, particularly at temperatures around 120-130°F (50-55°C).\n\n2. **Aging Meat in Plastic and Kitchen Settings**:\n   - Commercial meat aging involves plastic wrapping immediately after slaughter to retain moisture.\n   - Kitchen aging involves storing meat in cold storage, tying up assets, where it can lose about 20% of the original weight primarily due to evaporation.\n\n3. **Recommendations for Handling Aged Meat**:\n   - Buying meat several days before use and storing it tightly wrapped in the refrigerator is suggested to maintain its flavor and moisture.\n   - Loose or no wrapping may lead to dry spots due to evaporation.\n\n---\n\nThis summary underscores important elements of meat processing and culinary preparation, highlighting how temperature, enzyme activity, and humidity affect the overall quality and taste of aged meat."

    "contenu": "The document presents an analysis contrasting the characteristics and philosophies behind Old World and New World wines, demonstrating how these concepts shape wine production. Here is a structured presentation of the main points:\n\n### Key Concepts and Differences between Old World and New World Wines\n\n1. **Success of New World Wines**\n   - Consistent quality is highlighted with the phrase, “Every year is a vintage year.”\n\n2. **Old World/New World Continuum**\n   - The discussion notes that it's an oversimplification to categorize wines strictly by geographic regions since distinctions are also culturally and economically driven.\n   - Old World wines are usually described as less alcoholic, more acidic, possessing a mineral profile, and less fruit-driven compared to their New World counterparts.\n   - Old World styles focus on complexity and balance, enhancing food compatibility, while New World styles focus on flavor density and immediate impressions, often influenced by substantial use of new oak.\n\n3. **Philosophical and Practical Approaches to Wine Making**\n   - Real differences stem from human nature, cultural, and agricultural practices rather than just geographical locations.\n   - The mindsets of Old and New World wine producers are fundamentally different, reflecting various goals and expectations in winemaking.\n\n4. **Historical Context of Wine Origins**\n   - Historically, all wines originated in Eurasia with many of the best wines undeniably from Europe.\n   - Wine grapes were first domesticated in the Caucasus, then spread to the Mediterranean and Western Europe.\n   - The tradition of high-quality wine was largely developed by medieval French monastic orders. Monks improved wine by focusing on quality over quantity and iterating through observation.\n\n5. **Influence and Expansion of Wine Culture**\n   - Regions such as California and Australia only recently became significant in the wine industry, despite their current prominence.\n   - These new regions have developed their wine culture by adopting and adapting techniques and grape varieties unique to their regions, contributing to the diversity and richness of global wine.\n\nThe document integrates discussion of tangible attributes of wine with the historical and cultural evolution that influences both the public's perception and the actual qualities of wines across continents. The central theme revolves around the dynamic nature of wine philosophy and production shaped by human, cultural, and historical contexts."
