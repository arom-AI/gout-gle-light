The grape makes fresh, lively whites evocative of the famous albariños of northwest Spain.\n\n2. **CHARDONNAY**: The most widely planted white grape; it is the source of wines that range from bland to extraordinary. Most of the best come from cool areas and are made by winemakers who prize balance over oak.\n\n3. **CHENIN BLANC**: Historically used for jug wines; it is capable of making very tasty wines, although plantings have been in decline for some time.\n\n4. **FRENCH COLOMBARD**: Widely planted in less-than-ideal locations; it is grown at very high yields for jug wines.\n\n5. **GEWÜRZTRAMINER**: A very minor grape in terms of production, but some surprisingly delicious wines come from it, causing fans to wonder why more isn’t planted.\n\n6. **MARSANNE**: A minor grape in terms of production but it makes good, simple wines on its own and is a leading component, with roussanne, in white Rhône-style blends.\n\n7. **MUSCAT CANELLI, BLACK MUSCAT, AND ORANGE MUSCAT**: These are three different varieties, all of which share the word muscat in their names, thanks to their pronounced aromas. All are used primarily to make delightful semisweet and sweet wines. What is called muscat Canelli in California, the same as muscat blanc à petits grains, is the most frequently used of the three and is made into dry wines as well as sweet.\n\n8. **PINOT GRIS**: A major grape, also known in California by its Italian name, pinot grigio. It is turned into light quaffing wines, as well as more serious wines of substance.\n\n9. **RIESLING**: California’s dry rieslings pale by comparison to those made in the Old World or even in New World places like Australia and Washington State. But, more successfully, the grape is turned into a small number of late-harvest dessert wines, some of which are very good.\n\n10. **ROUSSANNE**: A minor grape in terms of production, but prized for its elegance and aroma; it is sometimes blended with marsanne in white Rhône-style blends.\n\n11. **SAUVIGNON BLANC**: A major grape; it makes simple dry wines that are snappy and citrusy, as well as more complex wines modeled on dry white Bordeaux. It is also used to make botrytized dessert wines. Sometimes blended with sémillon.\n\n12. **SÉMILLON**: A very minor grape in terms of production, despite its high quality; it is used primarily for blending with sauvignon blanc for white, Bordeaux-style dry wines and botrytized dessert wines.\n\n13. **VIOGNIER**: The leading white Rhône variety, it makes opulent, rich, full-bodied whites, evocative of honeysuckle and melons. Since the mid-1990s, plantings have increased."

Here’s an analytical breakdown of the sections visible in the document:\n\n### Introduction\n- **Context**: The document discusses the approach of \"Death & Co\" towards bartending tools and techniques.\n- **Preferences**: It mentions that everyone has personal preferences for particular tools like shakers, spoons, or playful gadgets originating from liquor industry swag.\n- **Practical Use**: It establishes that people often carry their favorite tools between home and bar, or keep them hidden at the bar.\n\n### Philosophy for Home Bartenders\n- **Audience**: Home bartenders.\n- **Philosophy**: The book suggests that unlike professionals, home bartenders don’t need elaborate setups. The recommended approach is to start with basic, functional tools and then expand the toolkit as one's skills and interests develop.\n- **Emphasis on Practicality**: Tools should be economical, easy to clean, and visually appealing.\n\n### Stirrers Section Overview\n- **Purpose**: Detailed discussion about tools used for stirring drinks, primarily focusing on barspoons.\n- **Barspoons**:\n  - **Usage**: Used for mixing drinks smoothly to chill them without adding air bubbles.\n  - **Design**: Typically long and slender, sometimes with a twisted handle and made from a single metal piece.\n  - **Function**: The critical part of a barspoon is the handle and the bowl, used for moving liquid in a mixing glass.\n  - **Variability in Measurement**: Barspoons do not have a standard capacity, ranging significantly in terms of the volume they can hold, from ½ teaspoon up to 2 teaspoons.\n\n### Points of Emphasis and Special Notes\n- **Inconsistency in Measurement**: There is an emphasis on the inconsistency in measurements when using barspoons and the inconvenience it can cause due to precision required for certain cocktail recipes.\n- **Recommendation for Home Use**: For accurate measurements, checking the capacity of a specific barspoon is suggested rather than assuming its measurement capacity.\n\n### Visual Aids and References\n- **Illustrations**: The document implies the use of illustrations to showcase different styles of barspoons (referenced as Appendix 3).\n\nThis document is helpful for those interested in bartending, especially in understanding the use and significance of different bar tools like the barspoon. It suggests a practical approach to assembling a personal bartending kit, tailored to the user's level of expertise and engagement in preparing cocktails."

Here's the structured content from the document:\n\n**Title: Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits**\n\n1. **The Noble Rot: Tokaji, Sauternes, and Others**\n   - Describes a wine-making method known as the \"noble rot\" involving the fungus *Botrytis cinerea*. \n   - This fungus helps the grapes lose moisture thus concentrating their flavors during a subsequent dry period.\n   - The process is notable for metabolizing tartaric acid and synthesizing glycerol and aromatic compounds, which contribute to a unique balance between sweetness and acidity.\n   - Origin: Started in the Tokaj region of Hungary around 1650, later adopted in Germany and Bordeaux by 1800.\n\n2. **Fortified Wines**\n   - These wines include additional distilled spirits to achieve an alcohol content between 18-20%.\n   - Fortification originated in the sherry-producing region of Spain before 1600.\n   - Fortification helps in preventing spoilage by vinegar bacteria and exposing the wine to air, enhancing its stability against unwanted oxidative changes.\n   - Known for being durable, most fortified wines keep well when stored.\n\n3. **Madeira Wine**\n   - A wine developed for long maritime voyages, found to improve significantly under constant temperature extremes during travel to the East Indies.\n   - Unique aging derived from the constant movement and temperature variations aboard the ships.\n   - Established in the 15th century and had become highly evolved by 1800.\n\n4. **Styles of Port**\n   - **Vintage Port**: Made from the best grapes in good years, aged in barrels for two years and then for at least 10 years in bottles. Known for dark, fruity taste and needing decantation to remove sediment.\n   - **Tawny Port**: Identified by its brown color due to oxidization, aged in barrels for 10 years before bottling. Can be kept open for weeks.\n   - **Ruby Port**: An intermediate port aged for three years in barrels, followed by bottling. \n\nThese sections illustrate intricate details about different types of wines, their historical backgrounds, and production methods that affect their flavor profiles and preservation qualities."

The three were imported from Bordeaux (allegedly from Château Margaux) by Irish immigrant James Concannon, who had founded Concannon Vineyard in the Livermore Valley, east of San Francisco, in 1883 (he was the first Irishman to own a California winery). Concannon's agent in Bordeaux was the legendary San Francisco lawyer-turned-grapevine-dealer Charles Wetmore, who himself had founded a winery he called Cresta Blanca. While many grape clones died out during Prohibition, the “Bordeaux/Concannon clones” survived the thirteen-year ban on wine thanks to Concannon's reinvention of itself as a supplier of altar wine to the Archbishop of San Francisco. In the 1960s, cuttings from the three clones were brought from Concannon to the Foundation Plant Services department at the University of California, Davis, where they were replicated as virus-free plants. A decade later, 07, 08, and 11 vines were planted by now-famous wineries throughout the state, and subsequently became legendary wines.\n\n---\n\n### Some of the Best Producers of Cabernet Sauvignon and Red Bordeaux-Style Blends\n\n- ADAMVS\n- Araujo\n- Arkenstone\n- Baldacci\n- BOND\n- Brand\n- Cardinale\n- Caymus\n- Chappellet\n- Chateau St. Jean\n- Colgin\n- Continuum\n- Corison\n- Corra\n- Dalla Valle\n- Dana\n- Dancing Hares\n- Diamond Creek\n- Dominus Estate\n- Dunn\n- Far Niente\n- Gargiulo\n- Grace Family\n- Groth\n- Harlan\n- Heitz\n- Jordan\n- Joseph Phelps\n- Kapcsandy\n- Kelly Fleming\n- La Jota\n- Lail\n- Laurel Glen\n- Lokoya\n- Long Meadow Ranch\n- Louis Martini\n- Mayacamas\n- Melka\n- Mount Veeder Winery\n- Opus One\n- O’Shaughnessy\n- Outpost\n- Ovid\n- Paradigm\n- Paul Hobbs\n- Peter Michael\n- PlumpJack\n- Quintessa\n- Reverie\n- Ridge\n- Robert Mondavi\n- Rudd\n- Scarecrow\n- Schrader\n- Screaming Eagle\n- Shafer\n- Silverado\n- Silver Oak\n- Sloan\n- Spottswoode\n- Spring Mountain Winery\n- Staglin Family\n- Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars\n- Turnbull\n- Venge\n- Vérité\n- Vineyard 29\n\n---\n\n**Note:** *\"In the Red Hills of Lake County, Beckstoffer Vineyards’ high-elevation cabernet sauvignon vines have a view of Snow Mountain.\"*\n\n**Next Section:** MERLOT"

No longer looked upon as curiosities, the local red grapes, led by Aglianico and Primitivo (a grape that is identical to Zinfandel), have caused a stir with their deep, full-bodied wines exploding with spice, parched-earth notes, and concentrated, ripe black fruit. Equally intriguing are the region’s new white wines. Tasty white blends from Sicily are derived from both indigenous and international varieties, and Sardinia is producing vibrant and delicious wines from the newly fashionable Vermentino.\n\nThe Vermentino grape is grown widely on Sardinia, in Liguria on the Italian Riviera (where it makes some lovely wines to sip while you're gazing at the beautiful people), and on the island of Corsica, which, although adjacent to Sardinia, is part of France. The grape is also grown on the French mainland, in Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon. Although the winemakers may speak different languages, they all agree that Vermentino makes wines you should know about.\n\n**Alternative Names:** Favorita, Pigato, Varrasena Bianca, Verneantino (Italy), Malvoisie de Corse, Rolle (France)\n\n**Styles:** Light- to medium-full-bodied dry white\n\n**Sometimes Blended With:**\n- Grenache Blanc\n- Marsanne\n- Roussanne\n- Ugni Blanc\n- Viognier (Italy, France)\n\n**Flavor Lexicon:**\n- **Fruit/vegetable:** Fresh grass, green or white-fleshed melon, green tea, herbs (lemon thyme, sweet basil), sweet lemon, lime, orange, or tangerine\n- **Floral:** Citrus blossom\n- **Earth:** Mineral\n- **Other:** Bitter almond\n\n**Similar Sips** Austere Viognier, aromatic Pinot Grigio, very light Gewürztraminer"

    "contenu": "The document is from a book discussing the science and culinary properties of eggs, specifically focusing on effects of various ingredients on egg foams used in cooking.\n\n### The Effects of Other Ingredients\n\n1. **Egg White Foams and Fat:**\n   - Egg white foams are significantly affected by even minimal traces of fat, which can be detrimental to the structure and stability of the foam. Fat can block the air-water interface necessary for forming a strong foam, making the foam less light and stable.\n\n2. **Salt:**\n   - Adding salt to egg whites increases the whipping time and decreases the stability of the foam. This is due to salt crystals dissolving into positively charged sodium and negatively charged chloride ions, which compete with the unfolding protein molecules. This competition reduces the number of protein-protein bonds, weakening the overall structure of the foam.\n\n### The Effect of Sugar:\n   - Sugar also affects egg white foams by delaying foaming and reducing the overall volume and lightness. The syrupy sugar-egg mixture can hinder the bond and unfold of the proteins, leading to a slow foaming process.\n   - In the oven, sugar holds onto water molecules, delaying their evaporation and contributing to a firm, cotton-candy-like strands of dried sugar, which impacts the texture.\n   - Typically, sugar is added to egg whites after the foam has started to form, enhancing stability and cohesiveness, yet making it more difficult for the foam to rise to soft-meringue levels.\n\n### A Silver Bullet for the Copper Theory\n\n- The section also discusses the use of copper bowls in creating more stable egg foams. The author conducted experiments in 1984, suggesting that copper from the bowl interacts with one of the albumen proteins, ovotransferrin, which makes the foam resistant to overcoagulation. This interaction leads to a more stable foam. A whimsical experiment using a silver-plated bowl also suggested that both copper and silver could block sulfur reactions between proteins, reinforcing the theory. This insight led to a revised theory on the beneficial effects of copper when beating egg whites.\n\nThe narrative style intersperses scientific explanations with personal anecdotes, making the content accessible and engaging for readers interested in the science behind culinary techniques."

    "contenu": "# EDIBLE PLANTS\n\n## Earth's Atmosphere and Photosynthesis\n\nBefore photosynthesis, the Earth’s atmosphere contained little oxygen, and the sun's killing ultraviolet rays penetrated all the way to the ground and several feet into the oceans. Living organisms could only survive in deeper waters. When photosynthetic bacteria and early algae burgeoned, they liberated vast quantities of oxygen (O₂), which transformed into ozone (O₃). This layer absorbed ultraviolet light and prevented much of it from reaching the Earth's surface, allowing land life.\n\n## Importance of Oxygen\n\nSo we owe our very existence as oxygen-breathing, land-dwelling animals to the greenery we cultivate and consume daily.\n\n## Why Plants Aren't Meaty\n\nLand-dwelling plants need access to reliable resources like soil, water, and air to nourish themselves, unlike predatory animals which hunt. They have developed economical structures such as roots for minerals, and complex internal chemistries for carbohydrate synthesis—essentially stationary chemical factories for survival. In contrast, predatory animals rely on muscle proteins for motion, as they need to hunt for food.\n\n## Strong Flavors and Effects for Survival\n\nStationary plants cannot flee from threats, so they resort to chemical synthesis for defense. They produce substances that deter animals and insects or make feeding unpleasant. Examples include mustard oil, hot-chili capsaicin, caffeine in coffee, and solanine in potatoes. Some plants even evolved to manipulate animal behavior or detoxify substances, ensuring survival through less direct means.\n\n## Plants' Use of Natural Pesticides\n\nPlants have evolved with natural pesticides, preventing them from being overrun by pests, unlike their animal counterparts that face decay. Humans have even found certain plant toxins pleasant, such as cabbage or onions, as we've learned to neutralize them through cooking or enjoy their sharp flavors as spices and herbs. Humans' penchant for foods with inherent risks, like certain toxins in plants, shows an intriguing side of our evolution, appreciating flavors and plants that fundamentally offer protection and essential nutrients."

In this tiny wine region just west of Florence, cabernet sauvignon has been part of the Carmignano blend since the eighteenth century. Today, by law, Carmignano must be composed of a minimum of 50 percent sangiovese, plus 10 percent to 20 percent cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc (up to 20 percent canaiolo, 10 percent white grapes, and 10 percent “other reds” are also allowed).\n\n---\n\n*In a sea of Tuscan sangiovese, it’s surprising to come upon vineyards planted with cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. Yet both grapes have been part of the Carmignano blend since the 18th century.*\n\n---\n\n### THE BEST WINE BARS IN FLORENCE\n\nFlorence has a number of extremely casual wine bars, often just marble counters, which are perfect for a glass of Chianti plus a snack of focaccia, some pecorino cheese, or finocchiona (“fennel sausage”) heaped on Tuscan bread.

Add the cheese and milk mixture. Whisk well to combine, then continue to whisk, adding the wine and cornstarch mixture. Whisk in the egg yolks, 1 at a time. When the fonduta is smooth and creamy, after 6 to 8 minutes, stir in the truffle oil or truffle shavings, if desired. Transfer to a fondue pot and place over a warmer. Serve as above, with strips of fennel, carrots, and toasted bread or breadsticks.\n\nPeople love a meal when they can participate in the cooking process. Fondue is an ever-popular icebreaker at the table, as guests dip bread or crisp vegetables into the communal pot that holds the creamy, rich, and perfumed melted cheese. I've provided a Swiss version using cheese and wine and a version inspired by the Italian fonduta that uses cheese, milk, and wine. Truffles are up to you. —Joyce\n\nWho would have thought that fondue would come back into vogue? A trip to Artisanal in Manhattan reminded me of how fun (and wine-friendly) this dish can be. Although many opt for Riesling and its higher acidity to accompany fondue, I prefer bright and fruit-forward Gewürztraminer, which has the texture and flavorful character to complement the cheese. While bread is a classic choice for dunking, flavorful white sausage, cooked pieces of potato, and even slightly sweeter carrots are lovely as well. For less ripe wines, I love pieces of fennel bulb, too. If you are using Fontina and making this dish as a fonduta, stick with the New World versions of Gewürz; but if you find the truffles, which bring a touch of earthiness to the dish, you can easily go with a European bottling, especially one that's been aged a few years so that the terroir has developed. —Evan\n\n**Recommended Producers**\n\n**Floral, Fruit-Forward Gewürztraminers**\n\n| Everyday                    | Premium                             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Foris (Rogue River Valley, Oregon) | Navarro (Mendocino County, California) |\n| Husch (Mendocino County, California) | Claiborne & Churchill (Southern Central Coast, California) |\n| Chateau St. Jean (Sonoma County, California) | Thomas Fogarty (Northern Central Coast, California) |\n\n---\n\nThis breakdown includes both the prose on fondue and wine choice and the table of recommended producers of Gewürztraminer wines, categorized under \"Everyday\" and \"Premium\" labels."
