    "contenu": "The extracted and structured content of the document discusses various methods for incorporating starch into sauces to achieve thickening:\n\n### Incorporating Starch Into Sauces\n- **Basic Technique:** If flour or starch is added directly to a hot sauce, it lumps and does not disperse evenly. Partially gelated starch forms a sticky surface that seals the dry granules inside, preventing them from dispersing.\n\n### Methods of Incorporating Starch:\n1. **Slurries:** Involves mixing the starch with some cold water to ensure the granules are wetted and prevent immediate gelation when added to the hot sauce.\n   \n2. **Beurre Manié:** Flour and butter are combined to form \"kneaded butter,\" which when added to sauces, gradually releases greased starch particles into the liquid. The butter helps to control the swelling and gelation rate.\n\n3. **Floured Meat:** Flour is applied directly to pieces of meat before they are cooked in the sauce. The flour absorbs fat during cooking and then disperses into the sauce, preventing lumps and improving flavor.\n\n4. **Roux:** A pre-cooked paste of flour (or any starch) and fat, typically butter, added to sauces for thickening. The roux is cooked to varying degrees to achieve different colors and flavors (e.g., from light yellow to dark brown).\n\n### Advantages of Different Thickening Methods:\n- **Flavor Improvements:** Roux or beurre manié cooking helps in rounding out raw flour taste and developing deeper flavors due to Maillard reactions.\n  \n- **Color and Texture Enhancements:** Heat causes starch chains in flour to split and form new bonds, creating a thicker texture that is less likely to congeal on the plate. Darker roux implies more intense cooking and therefore, a stronger flavor and darker color.\n\n### Special Techniques:\n- **Detrithination:** An industrial process to make starch more dispersible in cold liquids by drying starch together with dilute acid or alkali, improving its solubility and interaction with liquids.\n\n### Cultural Notes:\n- The use of roux is highlighted as particularly common outside of France, which may suggest regional adaptability and preference for this method.\n\nThe document emphasizes the importance of technique in the use of starches for sauce thickening, pointing out that each method affects the end result in terms of flavor, color, texture, and ease of use."

Amarone, at 15 to 16 percent alcohol, with a Port-like body and deep flavors of bitter chocolate, mocha, dried fig, and earthy flavors, stands as an exception. It has been praised by Victor Hazan, an Italian wine expert, who considers it a perfect wine to pair with roast and suggests saving the last glasses for a finial touch with Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n\n- **Section 2: The Uniqueness of Amarone**\n  \n  - **Content**: Amarone is described as a big, dense, red wine that comes from very ripe grapes in warm, sunny climates. The document highlights the Veneto region's historical struggle with cooler temperatures and how it adapted to produce Amarone, a wine known for its syrupy thickness produced through a special winemaking process called \"appassimento.\"\n\n- **Section 3: Production Process of Amarone**\n  \n  - **Content**: Amarone, often referred to as \"great bitter one,\" is produced in the Valpolicella region from the grapes corvina, rondinella, molinara, and sometimes negrara. It further details that unlike regular Valpolicella wine, about 40 percent of Amarone’s grapes are left to hang on bamboo shelving or in cool drying lofts for extended periods (3-4 months) to achieve extra ripeness and concentration through natural water evaporation - a process that enhances sugar and flavors in the grapes. This results in Amarone being opulent, full-bodied and more alcoholic (15 to 16 percent) compared to regular Valpolicella (around 12 percent alcohol). Amarone is then aged for at least two years, or four years for riserva, before release.\n\nThe document provides comprehensive insights into Amarone’s distinctiveness in flavor, production, and its suitability with specific gourmet elements, emphasizing its robust profile which stands out among other red wines even in combination with strong flavors like cheeses."

    "contenu": "### MAKING PORT\n\n**The condensed version would go like this: Add one part grape spirits to four parts fermenting red wine. In truth, however, making Port is quite a bit more involved—and fascinating.**\n\nFirst, the red Port grapes are crushed. (Usually, this part of any winemaking story is pretty ho-hum. Not with Port.) Historically, crushing was done exclusively by hand—or rather, by feet—in _lagares_, shallow stone or cement troughs (about 2 feet/0.6 meters high) large enough to hold about a day’s worth of picked grapes. After that exhausting day of picking, male vineyard workers would don shorts, hop into the _lagar_ (yes, they washed their feet first), and tread the soupy, hot, purple mass of grapes for several hours. In the early part of the evening the workers would link arms and march with great solemnity and difficulty (the mass of grapes is very slippery) back and forth in military-style lines, to the clapping beat of a foreman (the _capataz_), who called out a rhythm. But as the night wore on, the time would come for the _liberdade_. This was the moment when the women—and musicians—arrived. As the women jumped into the _lagar_, men chose partners and everyone began to waltz, polka, or folk dance (depending on the music).\n\nAmazingly, in the Douro, some grapes are still trodden by human feet—indeed many vintage Ports, in particular. I have fond memories (and pictures I’ll never reveal) of dancing recently in the _lagar_ at Quinta do Vesuvio until 2:00 a.m. Here’s what no one tells you: Your legs are bright violet-colored for a month afterward.\n\nAs it happens, the human foot is ideally suited to crushing grapes. Treading breaks the grapes, crushes the skins, and then mixes the skins with the juice for good flavor and color extraction—all without smashing the pips (the seeds), which contain bitter-tasting tannin."

Yet this is arguably one of the world’s top spots for sauvignon blanc, as well as Austria’s most beautiful wine region. Behind the small houses with their lace curtains and flower boxes, the vineyards stretch over kelly-green hills. Many vineyards have a *klapotez*—a wooden windmill with hammers that make a loud clacking noise to scare off the birds (who, unfooled, sometimes sit right on top of the contraption).\n\nEverywhere in Styria there are pumpkin patches, for this is the home of Austria’s famous specialty, pumpkinseed oil. Made from the roasted seeds of a special green-and-yellow striped pumpkin, the dark green oil is mind-blowingly delicious (see page 598).\n\nAs for Styrian wines, the best (almost all of them white because of the alpine climate) can be dazzling, with bright, focused flavors that have a keen, kinetic edge to them. Most of the top wines are found along the wine route (*weinstrasse*) in the hilly province of south Styria, Südsteiermark, where the lemon-yellow daylight is so vivid it almost seems polished. Vineyards here are among the steepest in the country, and the soils are varied—from slate, marl, and limestone, to gneiss, schist, basalt, sand, and loam.\n\nChardonnay (called morillon in Styria) has a long history here, the vines having been brought from the Champagne region of France in the nineteenth century. For the most part, Styrian chardonnay is made in the style of French Chablis—taut and linear rather than fat and buttery. But the biggest surprise—and Austria’s best-kept secret—is Styrian sauvignon blanc. These are racy, herbal, lemony wines, with a wild outdoorsy quality and a tanginess not unlike a good French Sancerre. In addition to sauvignon blanc and morillon, the varieties of note include welchsriesling, weissburgunder, traminer, and beautifully taut, dry, refreshing muskateller (aka gelber muskateller), the Austrian name for muscat blanc à petits grains, the best of the extensive group of wines with muscat in their names."

Here's an outline of the main points covered in the document:\n\n### Geographical and Historical Context\n- Hungary is described as a landlocked country featuring grassy plains, orchards, forests, and vineyards, bisected by the Danube River (called Duna in Hungarian), similar in function to how the Mississippi River operates in the United States.\n\n### Special Focus on Bull’s Blood\n- One popular Hungarian wine is known as \"Egri bikavér\" or \"Bull's Blood of Eger,\" primarily made from Kékfrankos and Kadarka grapes. \n- The background story linked to this wine dates back to the mid-1500s during a siege where the Turks believed the ferocity of the Hungarian fighters was due to them consuming bull's blood.\n\n### Variety of Grapes and Wines\n- Despite Hungary's size, slightly larger than Scotland, it produces a vast range of grape varieties, attributable to its northern latitude which enables a mix of crisp, light white wines from cool-climate varieties and rich, sun-ripened varieties from its continental climate.\n- The document lists several grapes including:\n  - Furmint\n  - Hárslevelű\n  - Juhfark\n  - Kadarka\n  - Kékoportó\n  - Olasz rizling\n  - Kékfrankos\n  - Zweigelt\n  - Additional varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Gewürztraminer (known locally as Tramini), and Pinot Gris.\n- It is noted that over 70 percent of wine produced in Hungary is white.\n\n### Branding and Labeling in Hungarian Wines\n- Many Hungarian wines are varietally labeled, mentioning the grape type distinctively on the label. The wine region is also noted.\n- A cultural insight is provided about the naming conventions in Hungarian wine labels, for example, Demeter Zoltán, where the surname is listed first.\n\nThis text highlights Hungary’s rich tradition in viticulture, its diverse grape varieties, and cultural nuances in wine production and labeling."

Below is a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Title: Sauces Thickened with Droplets of Oil or Water\n\n#### Emulsifying Particles and Proteins\n- **Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)** and **High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)** are the primary emulsifying agents in egg yolks. LDLs and HDLs are effective due to their ability to surround and stabilize fat molecules.\n- **Emulsifying Particles**\n  - Proteins, phospholipids, and cholesterol.\n  - Yolk granules, which are large enough to disrupt surface coverage, but are effective in presence of moderate salt concentrations.\n- LDL seems to be a less potent emulsifier compared to HDL and other yolk proteins due to its dispersed nature.\n\n#### Using Eggs to Emulsify Sauces\n- Egg yolks are most effective when they’re warm, allowing the proteins to unfurl and interact more efficiently with the fat droplets.\n- In cold conditions, hard-cooked yolks are less effective because the proteins are already coagulated, leading to a grainy texture.\n- Egg whites provide some emulsifying ability though they are mainly used as a low-fat alternative and have less emulsifying power but help in stabilizing the sauce through looser associations between the proteins.\n\n#### Cold Egg Sauces: Mayonnaise\n- Mayonnaise is described as an emulsion of oil droplets in a mixture of egg yolk, water, acid (like lemon juice or vinegar), and flavoring agents such as mustard.\n  - It includes stabilizing particles and carbohydrates critical for the emulsion's stability.\n\nThere is also a microscopic image included depicting oil droplets in mayonnaise, showing the structural presence of protein and emulsifier molecules amongst and on the surface of oil droplets, preventing them from coalescing. This visual helps underline the molecular interactions described in the text."

Here is the structured content breakdown of the document, including the cheese pairings listed in table format:\n\n**1. Xinomavro isn’t good:**\n   - **By itself:** Xinomavro is a food wine, not a cocktail wine. Choose a sparkling or a rosé version for chatting; most reds are less pleasant flying solo.\n   - **With fiery heat:** Anything that burns the lips will burn out Xinomavro's elegance, especially that of the delicate aged wines like the Reserves and Grand Reserves.\n   - **With bold recipes:** Xinomavro is medium-bodied and not too extroverted, and a full-flavored dish that commands too much attention can easily overshadow it.\n   - **With overly rich sauces and dishes:** Despite its moderate tannins, the elegance of most Xinomavro-based wines won’t stand up to lashings of cream, butter, and thick, mayonnaise-based sauces. Match the weights of your dish and your wine.\n   - **With sweeter dishes:** These wines can be lean and sharp. Dishes that are sweet or have a sweet edge to them exaggerate the wine’s inherent acidity, which will work against the dish. With this wine, opt for tart rather than sweet.\n\n**2.

    "contenu": "```markdown\n# THE MYSTERY OF MINERALITY\n\nThe word **minerality** is used to describe all sorts of different wines, from Sancerre to Chianti, yet curiously, there is no agreement among the world’s wine-makers and scientists about what minerality is, how it is perceived, where it comes from, or even whether it exists. \n\nMetaphorically, the word is often said to describe wines that smell and/or taste of crushed minerals, stones, with stones, or even ocean water. For many wine professionals, however, a minerally wine is not only a wine with stony/mineraly aromas and flavors; it’s also a wine that’s remarkable for its relative absence of fruit aromas and flavors. For example, the greatest French Chablis and Austrian rieslings (to name two types of wines often said to be minerally) do not exclude significant fruitiness.\n\nApart from aroma and flavor, however, the term minerality is also often used to describe wines that carry a distinct tactile sensation (that is, they stimulate the trigeminal nerve). And while some tasters associate this feeling with acidity, there is general agreement that the mouthfeel of minerality is not quite the same as the mouthfeel of acidity. The two can be easily confused, however, because sometimes minerality and acidity are found together in the same wine. This is the case with many white Burgundies, for example. Yet there are also notable examples of low-acid wines that possess distinct minerality—wines from Châteauneuf-du-Pape, for example, or tempranillos from central Spain.\n\nIn Europe, minerality in wine is often explained as the result of certain soils, especially limestone. In this view, the roots take up minerals from the ground, and these are then expressed as aromas and flavors in the wine. But, as logical as this idea seems, many geologists take issue with it. The problem is that minerals in rocks and soils—geological minerals—are intricate, complex compounds that are not easily broken down to yield their constituent elements. And even if a geological mineral were to decompose, thus freeing its component elements, there’s no guarantee these elements could be absorbed by the vine’s roots. Vinification adds to the already multipart problem. Yeasts eat various inorganic compounds in order to ferment sugars into alcohol. Processes such as fining, filtering, and aging add and subtract other compounds. In the end, the inorganic chemical profile of the matured wine is virtually unrelated to the geological minerals in the vineyard. And then there’s the final icing on the scientific cake: Most inorganic elements occur in amounts measured in mere hundreds of milligrams per liter—which is to say, amounts that are not detectable by analytics and theoretically not tasteable.\n\nNone of this, of course, sways wine tasters for whom minerality is one of wine’s assets, no matter how difficult it may be to explain.\n\nI have shared with two sensory scientists, from Cornell and Yale universities, my own theory about minerally wines, both white and red. Here it is: Minerally wines—whatever they are and wherever they come from—activate the salt receptor taste buds. That is, they are picked up on the palate as salt is. As such, minerally wines magnify other flavors and make them more lively; they make them “jump.” So, even though there’s never any actual salt in any wine, minerally wines enhance the foods around them by acting as the “salt” in a meal equation. The scientists heard me out. Their conclusion? Said one of them: “I think you're on to something.”\n\n> “To know is to be able to name.”\n> —ÉMILE PEYNAUD, \n> Le Goût du Vin (The Taste of Wine)\n```"

    "contenu": "# The Loire Valley\n\nThe Loire is France’s longest river. However, the most important vineyards of the Loire Valley only lie along the last few hundred kilometers of the river as it flows westwards towards the Atlantic. This is a very varied wine region that is made up of a large number of appellations. No one signature style is produced here; instead, there is an incredibly diverse range of white, red and rosé still wines.\n\n## Regional Grouping\n\nThe Loire Valley can be loosely grouped into four sub-regions, from east to west they are the Central Vineyards, Touraine, Anjou-Saumur and Nantais. These are not appellations themselves and, furthermore, unlike most other French regions there is no regional generic appellation for the whole of the Loire. (Production of Rosé de Loire and Crémant de Loire is focused in Anjou and Saumur respectively.) There is, however, an IGP – Val de Loire – that covers the whole region. These wines are typically straightforward wines displaying freshness, a light body and simple fruit flavours.\n\n## Climate and Grape Growing\n\nThe different sub-regions of the Loire Valley are subject to different climatic influences. Overall the climate is cool, but the Central Vineyards, which are well inland, have a continental climate whereas the Nantais region, with its coastal location, experiences a maritime climate. The vineyards of Anjou are slightly warmer and drier than might be expected given their proximity to the ocean. They are protected by the Mauges hills and certain vineyards there benefit from warm stony soils. By comparison Touraine, which is further inland, has a cooler, wetter climate and clay soils.\n\nThe vineyards lie at the northern limit for the production of the grape varieties grown, and variations in the weather patterns from year to year can mean that vintages differ widely. Fungal disease linked to high levels of rainfall can be a particular issue. As with many other cool climates the best vineyard tend to be those that experience the most sunshine and warmth. The most desirable locations are therefore those with a southerly aspect, generally on the mid-slope, and facing the river for extra heat and reflected light.\n\n## White Grape Varieties and Wine Styles\n\nMany grape varieties are permitted in the Loire. Only the most important local varieties are discussed here.\n\n### Sauvignon Blanc\n\nSauvignon Blanc is mainly grown in the Central Vineyards and Touraine. The Central Vineyards area has by far the smallest production of the four sub-regions, but it contains two of the most prestigious appellations for Sauvignon Blanc wines: Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. These vineyards are located on very chalky, well-drained stony soil. The wines from these regions tend to be dry and high in acidity, with hints of green apple and wet stones. It is often said that those from Pouilly-Fumé have subtle smoky notes. Certain individual villages such as Chavignol, and vineyards such as Les Monts Damnés (both in Sancerre), have created high reputations for particularly expressive wines. Some of these wines are able to evolve in the bottle, although in most cases Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé are not wines for ageing.\n\nWinemaking techniques vary from producer to producer. Gentle pneumatic pressing and temperature-controlled stainless steel vats are used to create fresh, fruity wines. Certain producers ferment and mature their wines in old oak vessels and keep the wines on the lees to give them a bolder texture. A few use new oak. Whether or not MLF takes place depends on the style of the wine producer wants to create, and is most likely to be encouraged in cooler vintages to enhance the acidity of the wines.\n\nTo the west and south of Sancerre, Sauvignon Blanc is also produced from vineyards lying on the tributaries of the Loire. Here the most important appellation is Menetou-Salon, which provides a source of more moderately priced wines made in the same style as Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. The majority of Sauvignon Blanc, however, comes from the Touraine region. Here, this grape is used to form the variety of flavours."

    "contenu": "### THE SCIENCE OF STIRRING\n\nThe goal of making a stirred drink is twofold: chilling and dilution. You want to mix the ingredients until they're very cold. The ideal temperature is between 18°F and 23°F. You also want the drink to reach its ideal dilution. Water is the most underrated ingredient in a drink. Too little and the drink will taste too hot, or alcoholic; too much and it will taste too weak.\n\nA number of factors can affect how quickly or slowly these aims are achieved: the temperature and size of the mixing glass, the size and quantity of ice cubes, the ingredients themselves, and the speed and duration of stirring. We addressed speed and duration of stirring above. Here’s how the other three factors will affect the drink, along with what we’ve found to work best for us at Death & Co.\n\n#### MIXING GLASS\n\nWe’ll spare you the refresher course on thermodynamics, but know this: The temperature of a mixing glass has a considerable impact on the interaction between the ice and liquid it contains. Your goal should be to slow the dilution process enough that the cocktail is very cold by the time it reaches proper dilution. A room-temperature mixing glass will transfer its heat to the cooler liquid within, speeding up the dilution process. On the other hand, a cold mixing glass will chill the liquid within (at least until the two reach equilibrium), thereby diluting the cocktail more slowly, which means you can chill the drink more thoroughly without diluting it too much.\n\nThis is why we keep our mixing glasses in the freezer whenever possible. During a busy shift this isn’t practical, but in that case we’re using the glasses frequently enough that they stay cold. At home, we recommend keeping your mixing glasses in the freezer. We also prefer a Japanese-style mixing glass, as its width allows more ice to interact with the liquid than in a narrow-bottomed pint glass, helping the drink reach its target temperature and dilution simultaneously.\n\n#### ICE\n\nIt all comes down to size. You can make a proper stirred drink with anything from tiny ice pellets up to one giant chunk of ice, and you can certainly use ice made in a home freezer, which isn’t as bad as people like to say. With different sizes of ice, what changes is how long you have to stir to achieve proper dilution. In a working freezer, which isn't as bad as people like to say. With different sizes of ice, what changes is how long you have to stir to achieve proper dilution."

    "contenu": "# The Land, the Grapes, and the Vineyards\n\nThe western coast of Galicia is a wet place. Rainfall is heavy, some 45 to 65 inches (114 to 165 centimeters) each year. Yet, critically, the rains usually occur in winter, when the vines are dormant, not during early fall, around harvest. Still, moisture is a problem that can lead to mildew, mold, and fungal diseases. Luckily, albariño, with its small, thick-skinned berries, is not highly susceptible to moisture-induced disease. Additionally, many of the older vineyards are still trained high up on **parras**. These are canopies of support wires attached to 8- to 10-foot-high (2.4- to 3-meter high) granite columns. At harvest, tractors run under the parras, and pickers, working from stepladders, pick grapes that are over their heads. Lifted far above the land in this manner, not only are the grapes less affected by ground moisture but the increased air circulation also helps keep them dry. Dew and moisture notwithstanding, the presence of the ocean nearby is a positive force (as it is in Bordeaux), mitigating wide swings in temperature and otherwise extreme climatic conditions.\n\n![A man plays the gaita, the traditional Galician guitar, outside the majestic cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.](image-url)\n\nAlthough it is a tiny **Denominación de Origen**, comprising just over 9,000 acres (3,600 hectares), Rías Baixas is spread over five noncontiguous areas. The northernmost zones are Ribeira de Ulla and Val do Salnés; the most inland and more mountainous zone is Condado de Tea; Soutomaior is the tiniest; and O Rosal, named for the roses that grow everywhere, is just over the border from Portugal. Each zone has its share of very good wines and top producers. The best vineyards have well-draining sandy/granitic soil, some of which has clay and limestone mixed in. They are planted on southwest-facing slopes to ensure the maximum number of hours of sun for ripening."
