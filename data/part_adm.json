    "contenu": "The document contains information about roots and tubers, focusing primarily on sweet potatoes and cassava. It is structured into sections that address specific topics.\n\n---\n\n### Sweet Potatoes: Characteristics and Cooking Properties\n\n- **Subtropical Heritage**: Sweet potatoes store best at temperatures between 55-60°F (13-16°C). Chilling can harden the core of the root, known as \"hardcore.\"\n  \n- **Sweetening Process**: During cooking, certain sweet potato varieties release sugars due to an enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose. This enzyme activity varies among different varieties, causing some to be sweeter than others. Optimal temperatures for enzyme activity range from 135°F/57°C to 170°F/77°C.\n\n- **Varietal Differences**: Sweet potatoes can range from moist varieties, which consist of 75% of their starch turning to maltose, to less sweet dry types. Additionally, specific varieties experience enzymatic degradation differently, influencing sweetness and textural outcomes.\n\n- **Phenolic Compounds**: Some sweet potatoes, particularly ones with red skin, contain phenolic compounds, which may lead to after-cooking darkening.\n\n### Cassava: Varieties and Uses\n\n- **General Information**: Cassava, also known as Manioc and Yuca, is a staple root vegetable deriving from the spurge family, specifically _Manihot esculenta_. It has the ability to be stored in the ground for up to three years and has been a crucial crop in areas such as South America, Africa, and Asia.\n\n- **Toxicity and Processing**: Cassava is known for containing cyanogenic compounds. There are two main types of cassava: \"sweet\" varieties that are less toxic and more common domestically, and \"bitter\" varieties which require extensive processing to remove toxic elements.\n\n- **Food Products**: Cassava is versatile, being used to make flatbreads, tapioca (small pearls used in puddings and drinks), and is also consumed as fermented foods.\n\n### Etymology of Common Food Words\n\n- **Potato**: The word \"potato\" is derived from the Spanish \"patata,\" which itself comes from the Taino word \"batata\" for what is known as sweet potato. The true potato is referred to as \"papa\" in Quechua, a native language of the Andes.\n\n- **Yam**: The term \"yam\" originates from Portuguese, based on a word from West Africa that means \"to eat.\"\n\n--- \n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the sections dealing with the characteristics, processing, and linguistic origins related to roots and tubers like sweet potatoes and cassava."

In 1984, canola oil and the computer mouse and compact discs were all novelties. So was the idea of inviting cooks to explore the biological and chemical insides of foods. It was a time when a book like this really needed an introduction!\n\nTwenty years ago the worlds of science and cooking were neatly compartmentalized. There were the basic sciences, physics and chemistry and biology, delving deep into the nature of matter and life. There was food science, an applied science mainly concerned with understanding the materials and processes of industrial manufacturing. And there was the world of small-scale home and restaurant cooking, traditional crafts that had never attracted much scientific attention. Nor did they really need any. Cooks had been developing their own body of practical knowledge for thousands of years, and had plenty of reliable recipes to work with.\n\nI had been fascinated by chemistry and physics when I was growing up, experimented with electroplating and Tesla coils and telescopes, and went to Caltech planning to study astronomy. It wasn’t until after I’d changed directions and moved on to English literature—and had begun to cook—that I first heard of food science. At dinner one evening in 1976 or 1977, a friend from New Orleans wondered aloud why dried beans were such a problematic food, why indulging in red beans and rice had to cost a few hours of sometimes embarrassing discomfort. Interesting question! A few days later, working in the library and needing a break from 19th-century poetry, I remembered it and the answer a biologist friend had dug up (indigestible sugars), thought I would browse in some food books, wandered over to that section, and found shelf after shelf of strange titles. _Journal of Food Science. Poultry Science. Cereal Chemistry._ I flipped through a few volumes, and among the mostly bewildering pages found hints of answers to other questions that had never occurred to me. Why do eggs solidify when we cook them? Why do fruits turn brown when we cut them? Why is bread dough bouncy alive, and why does bounciness make good bread? Which kinds of dried beans are the worst offenders, and how can a cook tame them?\n\nIt was great fun to make and share these little discoveries, and I began to think that many people interested in food might enjoy them. Eventually I found time to immerse myself in food science and history and wrote _On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen_.\n\nAs I finished, I realized that cooks more serious than my friends and I might be skeptical about the relevance of cells and molecules to their craft. So I spent much of the introduction trying to bolster my case. I began by quoting an unlikely trio of individuals."

    "contenu": "# THE LEGENDARY ROBERT MONDAVI\n\nNapa Valley's reputation as the premier wine region in the United States is due not only to the quality of its wines, but also to the relentless will of its vintners, including the late Robert Mondavi. Born in Virginia, Minnesota, in 1913, Mondavi grew up with hardworking Italian immigrant parents and got into Stanford University during the Great Depression. From owning a fruit packing business during Prohibition, the family eventually went on to become winery owners by purchasing Napa Valley's Charles Krug winery in 1943. Robert was in charge of the business and marketing; his older brother, Peter, was in charge of winemaking. But after his brother fired him during a severe quarrel in 1965, Robert Mondavi moved six miles south to the hamlet of Oakville and, at the age of fifty-three, started his own winery, naming the venture after himself. Despite years of subsequent lawsuits with his brother, and what appeared to be endless family infighting, Mondavi succeeded in making the Robert Mondavi Winery an international emblem of a top California estate. Throughout, Mondavi was a tireless crusader for California's place in the wine empyrean. His credo—that California wines belonged in the company of the greatest wines of the world—became a refrain he repeated endlessly to anyone who would listen. Countless did, and Mondavi rose to international fame, eventually forming some of the wine world's first global joint ventures. (Mondavi reportedly struck the deal with Baron Philippe de Rothschild, of Château Mouton-Rothschild, in the baron's bedroom, with the baron still in his pajamas.) In his later years, Mondavi, with his wife, Margrit, brought wine together with art, music, and cuisine as an exploration of culture and living well. In 2004, amidst fractious disagreements among Mondavi’s children and among the winery’s investors, Constellation Brands was able to launch a takeover, and eventually acquired the Robert Mondavi Winery for $1.36 billion in cash, and assumed the winery’s debt.\n\n## NAPA VALLEY GRAPE VARIETIES\n\nAlthough Napa Valley is planted with numerous varieties, no grape captures the success of the valley better than cabernet sauvignon. Chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, merlot, and zinfandel can all become very good, and occasionally brilliant, wines in Napa Valley, but the top cabernets are phenomenal. No other wine region in the country makes as many stunningly rich and complex cabernets year after year.\n\nSome of these top-notch cabernet sauvignons are made from 100 percent cabernet. But others have small amounts of merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot, and/or malbec—the so-called Bordeaux varieties—blended in. Some of these wines are given a proprietary name if the percentage of cabernet is less than 75 percent. (In 1974, Joseph Phelps was the first to release a proprietary named “Bordeaux blend”—Insignia.) Today, even more commonly, top estates in Napa Valley simply refer to the wine by the estate name. So, for example, Harlan Estate’s cabernet sauvignon-based wine is labeled simply Harlan Estate; Dalle Valle is just Dalle Valle, and so on. This, of course, truly mirrors Bordeaux, where the top wine of Château Margaux is labeled simply Château Margaux.\n\n## NAPA VALLEY AVAS\n\nIn addition to the American Viticultural Area Napa Valley, there are sixteen smaller AVAs within the valley. Some of these AVAs are in the mountains, others, on the valley floor and lower hillsides. (A word about the so-called “valley floor.” The term is useful because it distinguishes these vineyards from mountain vineyards. Yet Napa’s “Valley floor” isn’t really the floor of the valley, but rather undulating benches of land that, in a series of steps, are a few hundred feet higher than the small Napa River that flows essentially north/south through the valley.)"

This netting requires replacement every five years or so, which is an additional expense that many other world vineyard owners do not face.\n\n2. **Soil Conditions**: The text describes the soil conditions in Argentine wine districts. They are characterized by well-drained areas with generally low fertility, which results in smaller yields. The soils are notably gravelly and rocky due to deposits from glaciers and rivers that occurred thousands of years ago. Some also contain significant amounts of sand, clay, and limestone.\n\n3. **Phylloxera Impact**: Unlike Chile, Argentina has not been greatly affected by phylloxera, a pest that devastated many vineyards worldwide in the late 19th and late 20th centuries. In Argentina, phylloxera does exist but only in isolated spots, and does not have a fully functioning \"fly cycle.\" The text notes that phylloxera struggles to survive in Argentina's sandy, dry soils, or in soils that can be flooded, which might explain the relatively minimal impact compared to other regions. Modern Argentine winemakers typically plant new vineyards on rootstocks resistant to phylloxera despite the minor threat, avoiding reliance on entomological luck.\n\nOverall, the document portrays how Argentina's unique environmental and geological conditions have influenced its viticultural practices and contributed to the distinct characteristics of its wine industry."

The text notes that this remarkable green intensifies upon the initial moments of cooking in boiling water due to gases trapped between cell spaces expanding and escaping, which ordinarily makes the chloroplasts (structures within plant cells containing chlorophyll) in cells more visible.\n\n- **The Enemy of Green: Acids and Changes in Chlorophyll during Cooking**:\n  - Chlorophyll is fairly susceptible to acidic environments during cooking. When green vegetables are cooked, there are two main types of chemical changes that can occur to chlorophyll:\n    1. **Loss of the carbon-hydrogen tail of chlorophyll a**: This tail is essential for its fat solubility. Cooking can modify or strip this tail, making chlorophyll water-soluble and dulling its color.\n    2. **The replacement of the magnesium ion at the center of the chlorophyll molecule with hydrogen**: This usually occurs in acidic conditions and transforms chlorophyll into pheophytin a, which is olive green in color. The degradation is further accelerated if cooking is done at temperatures exceeding 140°F/60°C, resulting in the disorganization of the chloroplast structures.\n\n- **Illustration and Description of Chlorophyll Structure Changes**:\n  - The document features an illustration showing chlorophyll a in its normal state versus its modifications during cooking. \n    - The **left structure** represents chlorophyll a in its natural, vibrant state.\n    - The **center structure** depicts chlorophyll a with its tail removed, making it water-soluble and able to leak into cooking liquids.\n    - The **right structure** shows the result of acidic cooking where the central magnesium atom is replaced by hydrogen, leading to a dull green color.\n\nThis section substantively covers how the physical and chemical properties of chlorophyll are affected by heat and acidic conditions during cooking, providing a biochemical insight into why the colors of vegetables change when they are cooked."

It is more utilized when the grapes are not fully ripe, making wines appear fuller and richer. However, it's not allowed in many warm wine regions like California as it can produce high-alcohol yet flavorless wines.\n\n- **CHARMAT METHOD**: See bulk process.\n\n- **CHEWY**: A term describing robust, full-bodied wines that are chewable, such as Zinfandel from warm areas like Amador County, California. These wines have a chewy texture.\n\n- **CLONE**: Cloning in viticulture involves propagating grapevines from a mother vine with desirable traits. Clones are genetically identical plants resulting from natural or intentional cuttings, critical for vineyard diversity and replicating specific wine characteristics.\n\n- **CLOSED IN**: Describes a wine that shows potential but is not currently displaying its aromas fully, either because it's young or it needs more oxygen.\n\n- **CLOUDY**: A wine appearance indicating the absence of fining or filtration to remove particles. Some cloudy wines may still be of good quality.\n\n- **CLOYING**: Refers to overly sweet wines with an unbearable candy-like sweetness, commonly criticized in dessert wines.\n\n- **CLUSTER**: A complete bunch of grapes.\n\n- **CLUSTER THINNING**: The practice of removing some fruits from grape clusters to enhance the quality of those left on the vine.\n\n- **COARSE**: A term used for wines lacking finesse, considered harsh and unsophisticated.\n\n- **COLD FERMENTATION**: Fermentation conducted in cooled vessels to maintain lighter and fresher aromas, often used for light- and medium-bodied wines.\n\n- **COLD STABILIZATION**: A winemaking process involving the cooling of wine to stabilize it by precipitating tartarate crystals, thus preventing them from forming in the bottle and making it less unbalanced.\n\n- **COLOR**: Wine color, varying from pale straw shades in white wines to deep reds in red wines, is an indicator of type, style, aging, and even quality.\n\n- **COMPLEX**: A wine that features multiple layers of aromas and flavors which reveal themselves over time.\n\n- **CONCRETE EGGS**: Oval concrete fermentation vessels that enhance natural convection currents, promoting more uniform fermentation compared to traditional barrels or stainless steel tanks.

Here’s a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Ingredients and Supplies Needed:**\n   - Cognac\n   - Licorice\n   - Egg white\n\n2. **Procedure:**\n   - Combine the cognac and licorice. Add egg white and stir until the mixture turns cloudy.\n   - Continue stirring slowly, ensuring the egg white fully contacts the liquor, creating wisps of denatured egg white.\n   - If available, use a centrifuge to spin the mixture and collect the clear booze. Alternatively, let the mixture sit and then stir again, followed by settling for several hours.\n   - Strain the mixture first through a cloth napkin and then through a coffee filter.\n\n3. **Final Steps:**\n   - Once a clear liquid is obtained, add water, lemon juice or citric acid, and simple syrup along with saline solution or salt.\n   - Chill the mixture to approximately -6°C (20°F).\n   - Carbonate the mixture using a preferred method (linked to a section on carbonation).\n   - Note that residual egg protein remains in the drink, which will cause it to foam when carbonated.\n\n4. **Note about Carbonation Link:**\n   - It indicates a hyperlink (\"here\") which presumably provides additional information on carbonation techniques.\n\nThe document does not include a table.

    "contenu": "# ICE\n\nIt's easy to forget that cocktails—like human bodies—are mostly water. Most drinks contain between 20 and 25 percent water from melted ice. This doesn’t take into account the water inherent in other ingredients, such as spirits, modifiers, fresh juice, and sweeteners.\n\nWith very few exceptions, water is added to a drink in its solid state: ice. Both a tool and an ingredient, ice performs two key functions in cocktails: dilution and temperature change. In shaken cocktails, ice also agitates the drink.\n\nOne of the biggest advancements in modern cocktail making is the ready availability of good ice. We define good ice as being cold, dry, and neutral in flavor. We don’t make a big fuss over clarity. Cloudy ice works just as well in a cocktail as crystal clear cubes, though a large, glimmering block of perfectly transparent ice always makes for a sexier drink. Cloudiness is simply caused by dissolved gases, which get pushed toward the center as the ice freezes from all directions, and won’t diminish the quality of a cocktail.\n\nAt Death & Co we use a few styles of ice, choosing among them depending on the type of drink we’re making: Kold-Draft ice, block ice, crushed or pellet ice, and punch ice.\n\n---\n\n# KOLD-DRAFT\n\nThe Kold-Draft machine is probably the biggest technical innovation in bartending since the invention of the freezer. It creates dense, 1¼-inch cubes of crystalline ice which are ideal for cocktails."
