    "contenu": "The provided page discusses several topics related to the history and refinement of coffee brewing:\n\n### Coffee\n- **Origin**: Coffee trees are native to East Africa, first valued for their sweet cherry-like fruits.\n- **First Use**: The dried fruit pulp or seeds were first roasted, ground, and brewed in Yemen in the 14th century.\n- **Word Origin**: The word \"coffee\" comes from the Arabic word *qahwah*. Its origin is debated but is generally linked to Arabic culture. \n- **Spread**: Coffee spread to South India by 1600, to Java by 1700 (via Amsterdam and Paris), and to the French Caribbean shortly after. From there, it reached Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia.\n- **Current Production**: African countries contribute about a fifth of the world's coffee production.\n\n### The History of Coffee Brewing\n- **Traditional Brewing**: The original version of brewed coffee is the Arab method, enjoyed in the Middle East, Turkey, and Greece. It involves boiling finely powdered coffee with water and sugar until foamy, then allowing it to settle and decanting into small cups.\n- **European Arrival**: The coffee that arrived in Europe around 1600 was concentrated with sediment and required immediate consumption to avoid bitterness.\n\n### French Refinements\n- **Isolation Technique**: Around 1700, French cooks began isolating coffee grounds in cloth bags to clarify the brew and minimize grit.\n- **Advancements**: By 1750, the French development of espresso marked an advancement by drip brewing and keeping temperatures consistent. This method allowed stronger coffee brews with reduced bitterness and improved flavor elements like tartness and aroma.\n\n### Machine-Age Espresso\n- **19th Century Evolution**: New brewing methods emerged including percolation. Plunger pots were invented, allowing better control over coffee steeping and separation of grounds from the drink.\n\n### Visual\n- An illustration depicts coffee berries and seeds. Each red berry contains two seeds, indicating the raw form of coffee before processing."

    "contenu": "## Raw Milk: Microbiology and Politics\n\nMany traditional methods of fermenting milk have relied upon raw milk and its indigenous bacteria. Yogurt typically is made with milk that is heated past the point of pasteurization, then cultured after it cools. But while this technique results in a firmer, thicker yogurt than if you introduce the same culture into raw milk, it is not necessary in order to produce yogurt, and we have no idea how far back the practice of preheating the milk might go, nor how widespread it is or isn’t, was or wasn’t. But conceptually, the roots of yogurt and all other cultured foods must lie in spontaneous events that were noted, appreciated, and in some way perpetuated. Most likely these especially pleasing spontaneous events developed out of the lactic-acid-bacteria-rich environment of raw milk, rather than the microbial blank slate of cooked milk. Even if eventual refinement of the technique yields a process in which the historical culture (or a reasonable facsimile) is introduced into cooked milk, still the culture and the ferment develop out of such spontaneous events.\n\nRaw milk is a very rich medium, and in the quantities that people milking animals have produced, accumulated in vessels, and stored—a phenomenon itself with no other precedent in nature—an extraordinary realm of specialized bacteria have evolved. According to geneticists Joel Schroeter and Todd Klaenhammer, humans \"essentially domesticated these organisms over the last 5000 years through repeated transfer of LAB cultures for the production of fermented dairy products.\" Though the bacteria have evolved in various ways in these specialized ecological niches that human cultures and their domesticated partners have created, the bacteria grew out of the pool found in the milk itself."

Below is a structured breakdown of this content:\n\n### Fish and Shellfish\n\n#### 1. Refrigeration: The Importance of Ice\n- **Key Concept**: Refrigeration is essential to prolonging the freshness of fish due to its vulnerability to spoiling from active enzymes at warmer temperatures.\n- **Details**:\n  - Fresh fish's enzymes are accustomed to cold waters; fish quality is best maintained when kept in ice, ideally at 32°F/0°C.\n  - Fish can last twice as long at typical refrigerator temperatures of 40–45°F/5–7°C.\n  - Utilizing continuous ice or close-contact chopped ice can prevent water contact that leaches away flavor.\n\n#### 2. Freezing\n- **Key Concept**: Freezing fish below the freezing point inhibits spoilage by bacteria and chemical changes in fish tissues, extending its edible condition.\n- **Details**:\n  - Freezing slows spoilage and preserves freshness but does not stop chemical changes completely.\n  - Fish are susceptible to \"freeze denaturation,\" a process where the liquid environment alters proteins.\n\n#### 3. Irradiation\n- **Key Concept**: Irradiation preserves fish by damaging the DNA and proteins of spoilage microbes, thus extending freshness.\n- **Details**:\n  - It can extend the shelf life of refrigerated fish by up to two weeks.\n  - Despite prolonged freshness, it's unclear if irradiation produces its own off-flavors or how significant it will be as a preservation method in the future.\n\n#### 4. Unheated Preparations of Fish and Shellfish\n- **Key Concept**: Eating raw fish and shellfish is popular in various cultures due to their tender texture and savory flavor which can be enhanced with minimal cooking.\n- **Details**:\n  - Methods like acidification (ceviche), salting (poke), and others are used to prepare fish without heat, capitalizing on their natural flavors and textures. \n\nThe document captures detailed insights into how refrigeration, freezing, and irradiation impact the quality and shelf life of fish and shellfish, while also touching on the culinary practices involving raw fish preparations."

Scale the recipes as you wish.\n- **Addition of simple syrup**: Every ½ ounce (15 ml) of 1:1 simple syrup will add 9.2 grams of sugar and will increase the sugar in a standard size (5.5-oz, 165-ml) carbonated drink by 5.6 percent.\n- **Addition of lime juice**: Every ½ ounce (15 ml) of clarified lime juice will add 0.9 grams of acid (0.6 grams citric and 0.3 grams malic) and will increase the acidity in a standard size (5.5-oz, 165-ml) carbonated drink by 0.55 percent.\n\n### X, Y, or Z and Soda\n\n- **Strong-flavored liquors**: Use a short 2 ounces (57 ml) of spirit to a draft 3½ ounces (108 ml) of water. Use good, filtered water and don’t pour the drink over the rocks.\n- **Fairly neutral spirits**: Up the alcohol percentage slightly, maybe up to a full 2 ounces. Keep it simple and do not go over that percentage unless someone specifically requests it. Use a drop or two of saline solution or a couple grains of salt for adjustment.\n\n### Carbonating a Classic\n\n- **Choosing the right cocktail**: Some classic cocktails, like the Manhattan, do not fare well when carbonated. However, other classics like the margarita and the Negroni can be successfully carbonated.\n- **Adapting recipes**: Modify classic cocktail recipes to make them work well when carbonated."

    "contenu": "**Title: SEEDS**\n\n**Paragraph 1: (\"oats...and teff.\")**\n- Topic: Impact of consuming oats on individuals with Celiac disease\n- Content: Consuming oats can cause issues due to an immune response against nutrient-absorbing cells in the intestine, which leads to serious malnourishment. Celiac disease can develop early and is lifelong, typically requiring avoidance of gluten-containing grains. Grains like corn, rice, amaranth, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, sorghum, and teff don't contain gliadin proteins, hence they don't aggravate celiac disease.\n\n**Subheading: SEEDS AND FOOD POISONING**\n\n**Paragraph 2: (\"Seeds are generally dry...avoidance.\")**\n- Topic: Characteristics of seeds and storage \n- Content: Seeds are naturally dry, containing about 10% of their weight from water, allowing them to be stored without special treatment. Because they are mostly prepared through boiling or roasting, seeds don’t carry bacteria that cause food poisoning, but are vulnerable to contamination during cooling. Therefore, leftovers should be refrigerated and reheated properly. Particularly, Bacillus cereus requires attention as it can cause food poisoning.\n\n**Paragraph 3: (\"Even dry seeds...should be discarded.\")**\n- Topic: Risks associated with mold and spoilage in seeds \n- Content: Despite their dry nature, seeds are not immune to contamination by molds, fungi, and other organisms, which can grow with minimal moisture and contaminate seed crops. Some organisms produce deadly toxins, and the presence of fungal toxins monitored by producers and government agencies pose lower health risks but still require caution. Mold or other spoilage on seeds means the food should be discarded.\n\n**Subheading: THE COMPOSITION AND QUALITIES OF SEEDS**\n\n**Sub-subheading: PARTS OF THE SEED**\n\n**Paragraph 4: (\"All of our food seeds...and flavor.\")**\n- Topic: Basic parts of food seeds and their function\n- Content: Food seeds have three main components: a protective coat, an embryonic portion, and a storage mass that includes proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. These influence the texture and flavor of the seeds.\n\n**Paragraph 5: (\"The outer protective coat...and flavor.\")**\n- Topic: Description of the seed coat\n- Content: The seed coat is tough and fibrous, containing defensive compounds like tannins and anthocyanin pigments, which affect the cooking process and flavor of grains and legumes. Particularly in grains derived from barley, nuts, and almonds, these compounds help in cooking and enhancing the end-product's texture and flavor.\n\n**Paragraph 6: (\"The embryonic portion of legumes and nuts...desirable ones.\")**\n- Topic: Role of the embryonic portion of seeds\n- Content: Although less significant, the embryonic part of seeds contains oils and enzymes that can impact the flavor, useful for both cooking and aroma.\n\n**Paragraph 7: (\"The bulk of the seed...protein bodies.\")**\n- Topic: Storage tissue in seeds\n- Content: Seeds primarily consist of storage tissue, which affects the seed’s texture. This tissue is filled with protein, starch granules, and oil, contributing to the seed’s structural integrity. In some seeds, the cell walls are filled with carbohydrates that can absorb water, aiding in storage and cooking."

Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Tequila and Mezcal\n- Both tequila and mezcal are derived from the agave plant.\n- **Tequila** is primarily made from blue agave, and depending on the aging process, can be classified into blanco, reposado, or añejo.\n- **Mezcal** is made from over 30 types of agave and is double-distilled, first in small clay pots, then in a larger metal pot still. It usually doesn't involve wood aging.\n\nUnique Aspects:\n- **Flavors**: They feature roasty aromas, floral notes like linalool and damascenone, phenylethyl alcohol, and vanilla (vanillin).\n\n### Flavored Alcohols: Bitters and Liqueurs\n\n#### Bitters\n- Described as descendants of medicinal herbal brews.\n- Examples include angostura (Galipea cusparia), ingredients from the citrus family, Chinese rhubarb root, and gentian.\n- Made either by macerating plant materials or distilling them combined with alcohol sources. The text mentions complexity due to these methods.\n\n#### Liqueurs\n- Sugared and more varied in flavor compared to bitters.\n- Often feature a contribution to body and density from the added sugar.\n\n### Some Examples of Flavored Alcohols\n**Flowers:**\n  - Sambuca (elderflower), Gul (rose)\n\n**Spices:**\n  - Anisette (anise), Pimento (allspice)\n  \n**Nuts:**\n  - Amaretto (almond), Frangelico (hazel), nocino (green walnuts)\n  \n**Coffee:**\n  - Kahlúa, Tia Maria\n  \n**Chocolate:**\n  - Crème de cacao\n  \n**Fruits:**\n  - Cointreau, Curaçao, Grand Marnier, Triple Sec (orange), Midori (melon), Cassis (black currants), limoncello (lemon), sloe “gin” (plum)\n  \n**Herbs:**\n  - Benedictine, Chartreuse, Jagermeister, Crème de menthe, peppermint schnapps\n\n### Layering Liqueurs\n- Discusses how liqueurs can be layered in a drink due to different densities and sugar content creating distinct layers in the glass, ranging from denser, darker liqueurs at the bottom to lighter ones at the top.\n- The layering can produce visually appealing and flavorful drinks, and over time, the layers may blend into a uniform mix.\n\n--- \n\nThis breakdown includes both specific details on the types of spirits discussed and their method of production, as well as examples within each category."

    "contenu": "The document is a detailed description of various unfermented dairy products, specifically focusing on margarine and Indian clarified butter, also known as ghee. Here is a summary of the content structured by topic:\n\n### Margarine and Other Dairy Spreads\n- **History and Development**: Originally created in 1869 as an inexpensive food to supplement inadequate butter supplies. Early margarine was flavored beef tallow mixed with milk.\n- **Geographical Spread**: It gained popularity in Europe and the United States due to surplus skim milk from butter making being used for margarine production.\n- **Resistance**: In the U.S., the dairy industry strongly resisted the spread of margarine usage.\n- **Modern Margarine**: More recent formulations use hydrogenated oils, shifting from animal-based fats. The hydrogenation process hardens the oils but maintains spreadability at colder temperatures.\n- **Health Aspects**: Margarine was originally welcomed for its lower levels of saturated fats compared to butter, contributing to better heart health. Modern science illustrates different statistics comparing margarine's fat ratio to that of butter.\n\n### Indian Clarified Butter: Ghee\n- **Cultural Significance**: Ghee is highly revered in India, used both as a food and in religious and traditional practices. \n- **Production Process**: Traditionally made by souring cow or buffalo milk with lactic acid bacteria to make dahi (yogurt-like product), then churned to make butter, and finally heated to separate the milk solids from the liquid fats.\n- **Properties and Usage**: Ghee has an extended shelf-life of up to eight months and is used for various culinary purposes. High heating during its production also generates antioxidant compounds.\n- **Flavor Profile**: Ghee has a notable flavor profile described as sweeter compared to butter, due to evaporation rates during its processing.\n\nThis text combines historical, cultural, scientific, and nutritional information to provide a comprehensive view of these dairy products."

Below is the structured extraction of the document content.\n\n---\n\n### FORMS OF HEAT TRANSFER\n\n#### 1. Conduction Within a Food\n- **Overview**: Heat moves from the outside to the center of a solid piece of food—meat or fish or vegetable—by conduction.\n- **Cellular structure**: The cellular structure of foods impedes heat movement, making foods insulators rather than conductors like metals.\n- **Cooking implications**: Heating food evenly to the desired doneness without overheating is challenging due to varying thickness and heat absorption rates.\n- **Example**: A compact chop or thick steak takes longer to cook through compared to thinner pieces due to slower heat movement.\n\n#### 2. Convection: Movement in Fluids\n- **Definition**: Convection is the movement of heat in a fluid, which can be a liquid or gas, through the movement of the fluid's molecules.\n- **Process**: It involves the transfer of heat from warmer molecules to cooler ones, the subsequent rise of heated molecules, and the sinking of cooled ones.\n- **Significance**: Convection influences natural phenomena like winds, ocean currents, and the heating of our homes.\n\n#### 3. Radiation: The Pure Energy of Radiant Heat and Microwaves\n- **Solar heating**: Earth is warmed by radiant heat from the sun, which travels across nearly empty space as it does not require a medium.\n- **Fundamental nature**: All matter emits thermal radiation which can be detected when objects are very hot.\n- **Invisibility of radiant heat**: Most radiant heat, such as that emitted from stove burners, is invisible and is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n- **Historical insight**: Notably, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation, a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is invisible to the naked eye.\n\n#### 4. Different Kinds of Radiation Carry Different Amounts of Energy\n- **Variability**: Radiation's effect varies depending on the amount and type of energy it carries, influencing how it affects different materials and environments.\n\n---\n\nThis structured content provides a succinct summary and outline of the key points discussed in the document regarding heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation. Each section breaks down the technical concepts and implicates them in everyday phenomena and specific scenarios."

As they accumulate and grow, the yeasts form small curds. In a month’s time, the flor will blanket the wine.**\n\n**A century ago, horrified by the foul-looking flor, Sherry makers believed that certain barrels of wine simply got “sick.” Slowly, opinion changed. The flor-covered wines, they noticed, emerged from the solera light, fresh, and very dry. This came to be seen as a blessing, for such a wine was, in fact, well suited to the sultry local climate. Enologists now know that flor is a family of four complex, wild strains of _Saccharomyces_ yeasts (the leading one of which is called _Saccharomyces beticus_) that bloom spontaneously in Jerez’s humid air.**\n\n---"

Here is a structured breakdown of both:\n\n### Tepache\n- **Description**: Tepache is described as a refreshing and slightly sweet beverage made from fermented fruits (pineapple is commonly used, but other fruit variations exist). It is made by fermenting fruit with brown sugar. The maturity of the beverage can range from lightly alcoholic to vinegar-like depending on fermentation duration.\n- **Process**:\n  1. Mix pineapple peels with sugar water, the more unrefined the sugar, the better.\n  2. Allow for fermentation:\n     - **Tropical climates**: Approximately 24 hours.\n     - **Cooler climates**: Several days.\n  3. Taste to determine the desired level of fermentation.\n- **Variations**: While pineapple is popular, other fruits can be used. Optional sweeteners include honey or other less refined sugars.\n- **Example**: Karen Hurtubise from North Carolina makes a raspberry variant she calls \"raspbubble.\" She dissolves 1 cup of honey in 3 quarts/liters of water, adds a quarter/liter of fresh raspberries, ferments for three days, and then refrigerates.\n\n### Fruit Kvass\n- **Source**: Hannah Springer from her blog, inspired by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride.\n- **Description**: Fruit kvass is a fermented beverage made with a combination of fruits, berries, and fresh herbs or spices.\n- **Ingredients and Process**:\n  1. Select fruits, berries, herbs, or spices that pair well.\n  2. In a 1-quart/liter mason jar, combine:\n     - A handful of berries (specific types and amounts can vary based on preference).\n     - Ensure all ingredients are organic for optimal fermentation results."

Each section within the document outlines potential pairings for different ingredients with a focus on flavor compatibility. The document includes explanatory text at the top describing potential pairings for specific ingredients such as black pepper and dried priprioca, as well as black pepper and bacuri.\n\nHere are the structured contents of some of the tables outlined in markdown format:\n\n### Potential Pairings Overview\n\n1. **Black Pepper and Dried Priprioca**\n   - **Description:** In the past, priprioca, an aromatic root found in the Amazon rainforest, was only used in the cosmetic industry, but Chef Alex Atala pioneered its culinary use at his restaurant D.O.M. in São Paulo: he has combined it with banana and lemon, paired it with white chocolate and used it to spice up a caipirinha.\n\n2. **Black Pepper and Bacuri**\n   - **Description:** The bacuri fruit is harvested when it falls from the tree, fully ripe – the now extinct Tupi language of Brazil, means \"to fall\" and curi means 'early'. Native to the Amazon Rainforest, this round yellow fruit has thick rind and is filled with fragrant white pulp, which has a sweet and sour taste. Used in drinks, jams, and sorbets, bacuri can also be eaten fresh.\n\n### Ingredient Pairings with Peppercorns\n\n#### Dried Priprioca\n- `green peppercorn` : ● ◐ ○ \n- `celeriac` : ● ◐ ○ \n- `grapefruit` : ● ● ○ \n- (More items follow similarly)\n\n#### Bacuri\n- `black peppercorn` : ◐ ○ \n- `ginger puree` : ● ○ \n- `jasmine tea` : ● ● ○\n- (More items follow similarly)\n\n#### Dried Angelica Root\n- `black peppercorn` : ● ● ◐\n- `carrot` : ● ● ◐\n- `Namutikam citrus fruit` : ◐ ○ ○\n- (More items follow similarly)\n\n#### Plumcot\n- `buttermilk` : ● ● ◐\n- `roasted Arabica coffee bean` : ● ● ◐\n- `huacatay (Peruvian black mint)` : ● ● ○\n- (More items follow similarly)\n\n#### Indian Bay Leaf\n- `toasted black cardamom` : ● ◐ ○\n- `Moro blood orange` : ● ● ○\n- `nutmeg` : ● ○ ○\n- (More items follow similarly)\n\n#### Allspice\n- `cooked basmatrice` : ● ○ ○\n- `tahini` : ◐ ○ ○\n- `boiled peas` : ● ◐ ●\n- (More items follow similarly)\n\nEach entry in the tables provides a visual indicator (shown here as \"●\" for high compatibility, \"◐\" for moderate compatibility, and \"○\" for low compatibility) concerning the compatibility of the listed ingredient with specific peppercorns. This format helps in quickly understanding the complexity and variety of flavor pairings possible with different types of ingredients and peppercorns."

The structured content from the document is as follows:\n\n### THE SCIENCE OF SAUCES: FLAVOR AND CONSISTENCY\n\n#### Flavor in Sauces: Taste and Smell\n- **Purpose of sauce**: To provide flavor in the form of a liquid with a pleasing consistency.\n- **Complexity in flavor**: There are thousands of different flavor molecules; they can be combined in countless ways.\n- **Key considerations**: It’s essential to keep a few basic facts about flavor in mind when constructing a sauce.\n\n#### The Nature of Flavor\n- **Composition**: Flavor is a combination of taste and smell—two different sensations.\n- **Taste components**: Five different sensations—sweetness, sourness, savoriness, bitterness, and astringency. Taste molecules like salts, sugars, and acids are soluble in water.\n- **Smell components**: Detected in the upper nasal region, arise from thousands of different aromas that remind us of various foods.\n- **Perception of taste and smell**: Taste is when food is in the mouth; smell is when it invokes memory without tasting.\n\n#### The Spectrum of Sauce Flavors\n- **Range of flavors**: From simple mixtures that provide a contrast to the food, to complex mixtures that fill the mouth and provide a rich background to the food.\n- **Examples of complex sauces**: \n   - French tradition meat-based sauces are rich thanks to amino acids and other taste molecules.\n   - Asian sauces (Chinese based on soy sauce, Indian and Thai spice blends) are noted for their complex flavors due to cooking and fermentation.\n\n#### Improving Sauce Flavor\n- **Challenges**: Often the issue is that there's something missing from the sauce.\n- **Improvement strategies**: \n  - Ensuring sauces have concentrated flavors as they are consumed in small amounts.\n  - Utilizing cook's perceptiveness and skills to perfect the flavor.\n\nThis passage goes into detail on how sauces enhance the dining experience through a well-maintained balance of taste and smell, illustrating the complexity and variety of this culinary element. It offers an insightful guide on how to critically approach sauce making and improvement."

    "contenu": "The document addresses various health-related aspects of cheese consumption:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Saturated Fat and Cholesterol\n- Cheese contains abundant saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol levels. However, France and Greece have high cheese consumption and low rates of heart disease, attributed to diets rich in heart-protective ingredients like vegetables, fruits, and wine. Consuming cheese as part of a balanced diet is considered healthy.\n\n### 2. Food Poisoning\n- **Cheeses Made from Raw and Pasteurized Milks:** There are concerns regarding the pathogens found in milk. U.S. regulations require that cheese made from unpasteurized milk be aged at least 60 days. Since 1948, few food poisoning cases in the U.S. have been caused by cheese, with outbreaks primarily linked to contaminated soft or unpasteurized cheeses. In Europe, some outbreaks have also been caused by pasteurized cheeses, illustrating a relatively low risk overall. Hard cheeses are noted for being inhospitable to disease microbes and rarely cause food poisoning.\n\n### 3. Storage Molds\n- Cheeses may develop molds such as *Aspergillus versicolor*, *Penicillium viridicatum*, and *P. cyclopium* during storage, contaminating their rinds. While it is rare for these molds to develop, it is advised to discard cheeses that are visibly overgrown with mold.\n\n### 4. Amines\n- Amines like histamine and tyramine can form in strongly ripened cheeses, converting amino acids into small amine molecules that can cause adverse reactions such as increased blood pressure, headaches, and rashes in sensitive individuals.\n\n### 5. Tooth Decay\n- Consuming cheese is recognized for its beneficial effect on slowing tooth decay. The action is associated with acid secretion from *Streptococcus mutans*. Eating cheese at the end of a meal can help to neutralize the acidic compounds due to an increase in saliva production, plus the diffusion of calcium and phosphate from cheese into bacterial colonies, reducing the risk of acid rise.\n\n--- \n\nThese insights collectively help underline the potential health benefits and risks associated with cheese consumption, emphasizing the importance of dietary balance and attention to specific health conditions."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content from the document focused on wine-making processes:\n\n### Wine\n\n#### Barrel Aging\n- **Description**: New wine has a raw flavor and a strong, simple, fruity aroma. After fermentation, it goes through various chemical reactions in a wood barrel that develops its balance and complexity.\n- **Process**: The wine soaks up substances from the wood such as vanillin and coconut-woody oak lactones, which modify its traditional wine-making flavor molecules. The wine is periodically exposed to the air, causing the oxidation of pigments and other phenolic compounds. This results in the formation of large complexes and changes the wine’s astringency.\n- **Outcome**: Over time, certain aroma molecules break down or react with oxygen which alters the wine's aroma, shifting from fruity, floral notes to more subdued general “wineyness.”\n\n#### Bottle Aging\n- **Description**: This involves aging the wine in barrels or tanks that allow controlled contact with oxygen for a few months to two years.\n- **Containers**: Wine is stored in impermeable glass bottles. Traditionally, the stoppers used are corks made from cork oak bark.\n- **Modern Innovations**: Due to the source-off-flavor issues from cork, some wine producers now use metal and plastic stoppers.\n\n#### Corks, Cork Taints, Corked Wine\n- **Cork Description**: Cork is from the outer protective layer of the Quercus suber, an evergreen oak native to the Western Mediterranean. Its cell wall is made up of suberin which is water-resistant and long-lived.\n- **Issues**: Cork can suffer from mold and bacterial contamination that produce off-flavors described as moldy, earthy, or smoky. Approximately 1 to 5 percent of wine bottles can be \"corked\" due to trichloroanisole, a compound resulting from the interaction of moldy cork and chlorine.\n- **Alternatives**: Experimentation with metal caps and stoppers made from foamed plastic to avoid the problems associated with corked wines."

    "contenu": "The text discusses various aspects of Tempranillo wine, its production, and its regional variations across several countries. Here is a structured content breakdown of the document:\n\n### Geography and Varieties\n- **Spain and Portugal**: Tempranillo, known as Tinta Roriz in Portugal, is popular in regions like the Douro River (as it changes its name to the Douro River), Alentejo, and the Dão, where it is often part of red-wine blends.\n- **Argentina**: Tempranillo has been historically connected and is present in Mendoza as a lovely wine but is often underachieving when blended into bottles.\n- **United States**: In California, a grape called Valdepeñas has been linked to Tempranillo without a definite connection confirmation. Other regions like Lodi, Paso Robles, and Oregon's Umpqua Valley are exploring Tempranillo's potential.\n\n### Wine Characteristics and Aging\n- **Vinter’s Choices**: Tempranillo can be unaged, aged in old oak, new oak, or traditionally, with different implications on the wine's character (rosado indicates rosé).\n- **Blending**: Not typically perfect on its own; usually blended with other grape varieties to enhance quality. Pure or nearly pure Tempranillo does best in regions like Ribera del Duero and Castilla-León.\n- **Oak Usage**: The use of American vs. traditional European oak affects the aging process and taste, with some producers favoring older oak to provide an accent versus a more modern approach using new or more oak.\n  \n### Modern Techniques and Traditions\n- **Spain**: Debate over traditional versus modern approaches to Tempranillo, specifically around the use of oak and aging periods. Traditionalists favor longer aging in oak with reserved and gran reserva wines. Modernists might use less or newer oak.\n  - **Prominent Wineries in Traditional Approach**: Faustino, La Rioja Alta, Marqués de Arienzo.\n  - **Prominent Wineries in Modern Approach**: Martínez Bujanda, Cosme Palacio y Hermanos, Roda.\n  \n### Aging Regulations\n- **Aging Classification**: Wines are classified based on aging periods into categories such as crianza, reserva, and gran reserva, each requiring different minimum periods in cask and bottle before release.\n\nThis document encapsulates Tempranillo's significance and versatility across various wine-producing regions, highlighting its adaptation and diverse interpretations in winemaking."
