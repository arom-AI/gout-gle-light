The kombucha is then transferred to bottles, leaving room to add sweet tea to acidify the next batch.\n   - Kombucha can be processed and consumed in several ways post-fermentation:\n     - **Direct Consumption**: Simply bottle and refrigerate to drink.\n     - **Flavored Kombucha**: Add fruit or vegetable juice, or a sweetened herbal infusion for a secondary fermentation to enhance flavor.\n\n4. **Innovative Flavors Mentioned**:\n   - The document cites an experience at the Cultured Pickle Shop in Berkeley where innovative kombucha flavors were sampled, including Buddha's hand (a type of citrus), mint, bee pollen, turnip, and beet. These kombuchas underwent secondary fermentation with additions like tea and sugar.\n\n5. **Long-Term Management**:\n   - If unable to maintain regular nourishment for the SCOBY, it's possible to leave the SCOBY in kombucha for several months. Fresh sweetened tea should be fed upon returning to resume the fermentation process.\n\nThis text provides a thorough insight into the kombucha brewing process, addressing both basic and advanced techniques to cater to different preferences and conditions."

In the U.S., that changed on September 6, 1989, when six thousand haunches of prosciutto were cradled aboard jets and flown to New York.\n\nProsciutto is made all over Italy, but the best comes from just one type of pig: the massive (350-pound/160-kilogram) Lambrea pig, raised either in Friuli, near the town of San Daniele (for prosciutto di San Daniele), or in Emilia-Romagna, near the town of Parma (for prosciutto di Parma). The pigs are fed natural grains and the rich whey from such famous cheeses as Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n\n**Prosciutto Processing**\n\nOnly 999 left to massage. A worker rubs, pats, and pounds haunches of prosciutto di San Daniele, made from Lambrea pigs raised in Friuli. The meat is rubbed with salt and naturally cured over 400 days.\n\nThe raw ham is cured without smoke or heat over the course of four hundred days. By contrast, some American hams are processed in one day. First, the meat is thickly salted, then the hams are massaged, pounded, rubbed, and eventually washed with water and a stiff wire brush. The haunches are hung to air cure slowly in specially designed buildings with long vertical windows. In Friuli, it is said that the warm, salty sea air mixed with the cold Alpine air is a perfect combination—the result is a coral-pink ham with a silky texture and a sweet, meaty taste that is exceedingly complex. In Friuli, prosciutto combined with melon or figs is served with a fruity, floral white wine, often a glass of Friulano or ribolla gialla.\n\n**FRIULI’S SWEET WINES**\n\nItaly makes more diverse, fascinating dessert wines than any other country in the world, and two of the most intriguing are Friulian—verduzzo di Ramandolo, made from verduzzo Friulano grapes, and picolit, made from picolit grapes. Both grape varieties are grown on the Alpine hillsides of the Colli Orientali.\n\nVerduzzo di Ramandolo is made near the tiny village of Ramandolo. This is one of the lightest-bodied, most exquisite dessert wines made anywhere. Often it has a beautiful coppery sheen and touches of herbal flavors. The best producers are Giovanni Dri, Ronchi di Manzano, Livon, and Ronchi di Cialla."

Ceviche is a light and delicious Latin American style of curing fish in lime juice. Over the course of just a few hours, you can see the appearance of fish transform as it is \"cooked\" by acidity. I was also once served raw beef, by the farmer who raised the cow, that was marinated overnight in vinegar, and underwent a similar transformation, having the appearance and texture of cooked meat, even though it had not been.\n\nWhey, sauerkraut, kimchi, and other acidified products with dense populations of lactic acid bacteria can be similarly used as environments to safely ferment meat and fish. In Iceland, fermented whey (sýra) is frequently employed as a fermentation medium for a group of foods collectively known as súrmatur, meaning \"soured food,\" mostly animal and fish parts. Icelandic food writer Nanna Rögnvaldardóttir recounted to me how whey preserving has been used historically, and how she uses it in her own kitchen:\n\nFish was almost always dried rather than soured, although certain parts of it might be preserved in sýra—mostly parts that may not be considered food nowadays, like the stomach, the swim bladder, milt, roe, liver, skin, tail, fins etc. (We are talking about a cuisine of extreme poverty, where everything was utilized). Even the fish bones (along with other bones) were sometimes soured for a year or more, then boiled until they turned into a soft mass which was eaten. I’m told that most bones will go soft if treated with time in sýra."

Below is a structured content breakdown of the key sections from the document:\n\n### MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\n#### **Yogurt Overview**\n- **Historical Context**: Yogurt has been made for millennia across regions from central Europe to North Africa and Asia. It has diverse uses, including being eaten on its own, diluted into drinks, or as an ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes.\n- **20th Century Developments**: Notable scientific insight by Ilya Mechnikov tying longevity in certain populations to yogurt consumption due to its probiotic effects.\n\n#### **The Milk Yogurt**\n- **Ingredients**: Made from various types of milk, primarily sheep and goat due to their lower fat which facilitates firmer yogurt.\n- **Properties**: Manufacturers may add substances like gelatin, starch, and stabilizers to enhance texture and prevent separation of whey.\n\n#### **Heating the Milk**\n- **Purpose**: Heating milk prolongs boiling to concentrate proteins, thus enhancing texture.\n- **Process**: Milk is cooked at high temperatures (either 185°F/85°C or 195°F/90°C) for a duration of 10 minutes to change protein properties conducive to better texture consistency.\n\n#### **The Fermentation**\n- **Cooling and Inoculation**: Post-heating, milk is cooled to desired fermentation temperatures and inoculated with beneficial bacteria.\n- **Fermentation Dynamics**: Temperature during fermentation impacts the growth rate of bacteria and texture of yogurt, taking anywhere from a few hours to 18 hours to set properly.\n\n#### **The Yogurt Symbiosis**\n- **Flora**: Yogurt typically contains *Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus* and *Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus*.\n- **Bacterial Interaction**: These bacteria work in tandem to influence milk acidification, texture, and flavor development (notably producing flavor compounds like acetaldehyde, giving yogurt a refreshing impression).\n\n#### **Making Yogurt**\n- **Stages**: Involves heating the milk, cooling it, and fermenting the warm milk to develop desired textural properties and flavors.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Inclusion of fruit and flavors in yogurts became popular in the 1960s, contributing to the variety in the modern yogurt market."

Below is a structured summary of the main points covered:\n\n### Shortening in Pastries\n- **Usage**: Shortening is easier to work with than butter, especially for making laminated pastries and breads.\n- **Temperature Resistance**: Formulated shortenings and margarines melt at higher temperatures (up to 115°F/46°C for Danish margarines), which is beneficial during baking.\n- **Flavor and Texture**: While shortening holds its shape at mouth temperatures better than butter, it often lacks the rich flavor that butter imparts, and may leave a waxy residue.\n\n### Water in Pastry Fats\n- **Butter vs. Shortening**: Butter contains about 15% water, which separates during cooking and can steam, lifting pastry layers. This is contrasted with shortening that mostly doesn't contain water.\n- **Effect on Pastry**: Water in butter facilitates the layer separation and leavening in laminated pastries. Puff-pastry margarine typically contains about 10% water to aid this process.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n- **Importance of Water**: Critical in pastries to bind flour particles and control texture.\n- **Eggs and Dairy Products**: Used to add richness and improve texture. Variations in these ingredients can adjust the texture, from crumbly to moist.\n\n### Cooking Pastries\n- **Baking Pans**: The type of pan (material and color) affects the cooking time and heat distribution.\n  - **Black Pans**: Slow cooking by absorbing more radiant heat.\n  - **Shiny Pans**: Reflect much of the oven’s radiant heat.\n  - **Glass Pans**: Allow for direct heating without absorbing too much heat.\n  - **Thin Metal Pans**: Tend to produce uneven browning.\n  \n- **Pastry Dough Cooking**: Works better in heavier gauge metal and ceramic pans due to even heat distribution. Pastries that require high temperatures cook better in these conditions as they set quickly and evenly.\n\n### Key Points in Cooking Process\n- Minimal water is used in most pastries, which helps in creating a crispy and golden exterior.\n- Over-temperature settings ensure that the pastry sets quickly to avoid sogginess.\n- Cooking method and choice of pan can greatly influence the texture and color of the final pastry product.\n\nThis structured breakdown focuses on the technical aspects of pastry making as described in the document, emphasizing the role of ingredients and baking techniques in achieving desired pastry textures and flavors."

Here's the structured breakdown of the recipe:\n\n### Ingredients\n\n- **For the Pear Preparation:**\n  - 1 tablespoon sugar\n  - 2 soft ripe pears, peeled, quartered, cored, and then sliced into crescents about ¼ inch thick\n\n- **For the Pork:**\n  - 1½ pounds boneless pork tenderloin\n  - 2 cups Bourbon Mustard Brine (referenced to be on page 234)\n  - 2 tablespoons grape seed or other neutral vegetable oil\n\n### Procedure\n\n#### Pear Preparation:\n1. Combine vinegar and sugar in a saucepan.\n2. Add the sliced pears and bring to a simmer.\n3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pears are barely tender, which takes about 2-3 minutes.\n4. Taste and confirm the pears are both tangy and sweet; add a pinch of sugar if necessary.\n5. Set the pears aside in a warm place.\n\n#### Pork Preparation:\n1. Cut the pork into medallions approximately ¾ inch thick.\n2. Marinate the pork in Bourbon Mustard Brine overnight in the refrigerator.\n3. Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.\n4. Pan-roast the pork, turning once or twice, until well browned on all sides (about 7-10 minutes). Take caution as the honey in the brine can burn quickly.\n\n#### Plating:\n- Place two medallions on each warm plate.\n- Arrange the cooked pears so that a few slices sit on the pork and a few are placed alongside on the plate.\n\n#### Taste Notes:\n- The combination of the pork and pears offers a unique taste experience. The tang and fruit of the pears enhance the meatiness, and the mustard along with the bitterness from the bourbon balances the overpowering tastes. The final notes in tasting are sweet, tangy, salt, and a lingering meatiness.\n\nThis recipe provides a detailed guide for preparing a pork dish with a side of cooked pears, exploring a harmonious blend of flavors."

    "contenu": "### Vintner’s Choices\nHarvested when ripe vs. less ripe, the choice of clone or selection, and single variety vs. blend, red vs. rosé are significant considerations in viticulture. Mourvèdre requires ample sun and heat to ripen fully, which is why it is more widely grown in Spain than in France, and more in Southern California than the north. Despite being a late ripener, Mourvèdre is at greater risk of weather damage than other grapes, and when it does crop, it’s not very prolific. Châteauneuf-du-Pape in France and areas like California's Central Coast provide ideal conditions for Mourvèdre, even though it struggles if the climate is too hot and dry. Regions like the Barossa in Australia, and Murcia in Spain and Provence in France, are noted for the suitability of their conditions for Mourvèdre.\n\n### Winemaking Philosophies\nDeep, forceful, and concentrated, Mourvèdre, when crafted on its own or from blends in places like Bandol or Alicante, can achieve extraordinary results. Regions producing 100 percent Mourvèdre include California and Washington and also South Africa’s Spice Route. Notable blends include GSM from McLaren Vale or Châteauneuf-du-Pape that incorporate Mourvèdre, showing the grape's capability of adding richness and concentration. Blends traditionally involve Garnacha, Syrah, and even Monastrell, melding well with Mediterranean and Bordeaux varieties.\n\n### Pairing with Food\nMourvèdre pairs into three main categories based on its style: robust reds, easy-drinking blends, and rosés. The robust red wines are ideal with rich, flavorful dishes like red meat, poultry, and game. These Mourvèdre wines pair well with rustic stews, sausages, or anything from the grill because of their ability to handle strong spices and flavors like rosemary and peppercorns. Lighter versions such as those blended with Grenache from Jumilla are excellent with grilled vegetables, roast squash, or tomato sauces, whereas overly herb-marinated meats can overpower the delicate flavors of the wine, making it taste metallic and sharp."

This is essential for protecting the product.\n\n#### Wine Packaging Types:\n1. **Bottle Sizes**:\n   - **la bouteille**: Different names are given based on their volume, particularly from the Bordeaux region. The types include:\n     - la Fillette: 0.375 L\n     - le Magnum: 0.75 L\n     - la Marie-Jeanne: 2.25 L\n     - le Double magnum: 3 L\n     - le Jéroboam: 5.25 L\n     - l'Impérial: 6 L\n\n2. **Other Packaging Options**:\n   - **le Bag in Box or BIB**: A unique, eco-friendly packaging option that ranges from 1.5 L to 1000 L, offering excellent protection from light and ease of use, and typically cheaper but often associated with lower quality wine.\n   - **la cannette and la canette bouteille**: Ideal for individual consumption, it helps limit losses but is usually rejected by producers due to the perception of promoting a low-quality image of the wine. These are being developed for use in new consumption venues such as bars and clubs.\n\n### Visual Elements:\n- **Image**: The document includes a visual chart titled \"Flaconnages et packaging\" showing different types of wine bottles and their sizes as mentioned above.\n\nThis section thus focuses on the different types and sizes of wine packaging as well as the implications of each type on wine quality perception and marketing."

This method was notably different, as traditional methods just used a sample from the last batch of yogurt.\n  \n**Cultural and Regional Yogurt Variations**\n- **Terminology and History:** \"Yogurt\" is associated with Eastern origins (the term itself is Turkish). The production and cultural significance have deeply rooted links in regions like Turkey, Southeast Europe, and the Middle East.\n- **Evolution of Cultures:** Techniques and cultures associated with yogurt spread through nomadic herding peoples and evolved distinctly in various locations. Traditional yogurt cultures encompassed more complex ecological communities involving multiple organisms, beyond just the two bacteria identified as essential by modern legal standards.\n\n**Personal Narrative: Bulgarian-Japanese Yogurt Culture**\n- **Contributor:** Áron Boros, Boston, Massachusetts.\n- **Story:** Áron acquired a yogurt culture in Japan in 2001 and has since continued to cultivate it, noting the bureaucratic luck that allowed him to bring it into the U.S.\n\nThe text provides a rich narrative of how yogurt cultures diverged based on regional influences, techniques, and the biological complexity of the communities, emphasizing the stability that traditional methods brought to yogurt production over time."

    "contenu": "### VERMOUTH\n\nThe indispensable ingredient in a martini, vermouth was first created and commercially sold in Piedmont in the 1700s. Vermouth is red or white wine that has been infused with a secret blend of more than a hundred aromatic spices, barks, bitter herbs, and flavorings, among them angelica, anise, bitter almond, chamomile, cinnamon, coriander, ginger, nutmeg, peach, quinine, rhubarb, and saffron. Until it was banned in the early twentieth century because of its potential psychoactive toxicity, wormwood was also included. In fact, the word vermouth comes from the German wermut, “wormwood.”\n\nHistorically, the Piedmontese used muscat grapes for their base wine, and thus most vermouth was white. Today, cheap red or white bulk wine from the south of Italy is usually used as the base, and as a result, the quality of vermouth is not as high as it once was. After the wine has been infused, it is then fortified to raise the alcohol content to 15 to 21 percent (table wine is usually 12 to 14 percent). Red vermouth is generally sweet; white vermouth may be dry or semisweet. Both are consumed solo, as aperitifs, or mixed into various cocktails, including Manhattans. The large, commercial vermouth firms, such as Cinzano, Martini & Rossi, and Punt e Mes, are all headquartered around Turin, the capital of Piedmont.\n\n#### The Gothic-Romanesque Abbey of Vezzolano in Asti\nThis region made famous by the semi-sweet sparkler also known as Asti (once called Asti Spumante). Dazzlingly fruity and a joy to drink, Asti is made from moscato (muscat blanc à petits grains) grapes.\n\n#### Dolcetto\nDolcetto is made in selected spots all around Piedmont, but the best wines generally come from near Alba (dolcetto d’Alba) and from around the small village of Dogliani (dolcetto di Dogliani), which calls itself the birthplace of dolcetto thanks to sixteenth-century documents that reference the grape, though the origin and parentage of the variety has not been established by DNA typing."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the process and the different types of fining agents used in winemaking to remove unwanted substances. These agents include:\n\n- **Egg whites:** A protein coagulant that attaches to the tannin in the wine, causing it to fall to the bottom of the barrel. Particularly popular in Bordeaux, egg whites are efficient at pulling out excessive tannin without affecting flavor significantly because the egg white's proteins do not impart additional flavors.\n  \n- **Casein:** Another protein coagulant derived from milk, used similarly to egg whites.\n\n- **Gelatin:** Made from animal skin and muscle, it functions like egg whites and casein. However, gelatin might carry a flavor and modify the wine's taste compared to other fining agents.\n\n- **Isinglass:** This is a gelatinous substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish, which works effectively in attaching itself to tannins and other particles.\n\n- **Activated carbon:** Derived from charcoal, this fining agent is particularly potent in removing not only excessive tannins but also other flavors and odors, making the wine almost neutral. It’s particularly used in extreme cases, such as when a wine is adversely affected by smoke from forest fires.\n\nThese fining agents assist in clarifying the wine, but their influence on the taste and texture of the final product can vary substantially depending on the agent used. This process of fining is essential in producing clear, tasteful wine by removing excess tannins and other suspended particles that might impact the flavor negatively. The document concludes by mentioning the specific use of activated carbon in cases where wine has been compromised by external factors like smoke, highlighting the utility of fining agents in maintaining wine quality under various conditions."

    "contenu": "---\n**Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality**\n\n## South Africa\nMost of South Africa's wine regions are found on and around the coastline of the Cape where they can take advantage of the cooling influence of the Southern Ocean. This, combined with the dramatic mountains backdrop, provides a landscape that allows South African winemakers to produce a broad range of wine styles.\n\n### Climate and Grape Growing\nWith its vine growing regions located at between 27° and 34° south of the Equator, South Africa should have a hot climate. However, although in certain inland areas the summer temperatures can become very hot (regularly rising in excess of 30°C), many vineyard areas are subject to cooling influences. The most important of these come from the Southern Ocean. The cold Benguela Current flows up from the Antarctic running past the tip and up the west coast of Africa, cooling coastal areas. This is magnified by the regular strong south-easterly summer winds, known locally as the Cape Doctor. These bring air cooled by the ocean further inland and can reduce temperatures by a further couple of degrees in some areas.\n\nThe other defining feature of the South African wine lands is the prominent mountain ranges running throughout the wine regions. They offer producers a dramatic range of different altitudes and aspects, as well as a multitude of different soils, which result in a range of different climate sites. Altitude has a marked influence on vineyard climate, with those on valley floors generally much warmer than those in the mountains. In common with many other wine producing regions in the Southern Hemisphere, vines may be planted on the southern slopes of mountains to benefit from cooler temperatures. This mountainous terrain can also cast shadows over nearby vineyards, again, giving slightly cooler temperatures during different parts of the day. Nearer the coast the mountains can also help channel the winds through the vineyards.\n\n### Grape Varieties and Winemaking\n#### Black Varieties\nCabernet Sauvignon, which is the most widely planted black variety, is used for varietal wines and also blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc for Bordeaux-style blends. On its own, Merlot is capable of producing full-bodied, plummy wines. Syrah is very widely planted too. In hot climates it gives rich, full-bodied reds that are often high in alcohol and display ripe black fruit flavours, sometimes with an earthy or meaty character. It is also grown in some cooler areas giving less full-bodied, peppery examples. Pinot Noir is less tolerant of the hot South African climate and is planted in small amounts on the coolest coastal areas. The vast majority of premium red wines are matured in oak, with at least a proportion of new barrels used, to give toasty aromas.\n\n#### Pinotage \nPinot Noir x Cinsault) is the only other black variety of significant signi{sic}cantry this. Crossing was developed in South Africa and, as it is hardly grown anywhere else in the world, is often deemed a point of difference. Pinotage is made in a range of styles. It is sometimes blended with international varieties, to make sometimes bolder wines.\n\n### South African Wine Laws\nSouth Africa's GI system is the Wine of Origin Scheme (W.O.). Wines stating Wine of Origin (W.O.) on the label carry a Certification Seal on every bottle.\n\nThe law recognizes four different sizes of production area. The largest is the geographical unit, a catch-all appellation that allows for multiple regional and district blends. Currently, the only one of any importance is Western Cape. This is widely used by producers even for premium wines as it allows producers to blend the best parcels of fruit from different areas. The Western Cape is divided into regions – large areas that tend to follow prominent geological features. The most important regions for wine grape growing are the Coastal Region, Breede River Valley and Cape South Coast. These regions are further split into districts and then wards.\n\n#### Other Labeling Terms\nLike many other wine producing countries and regions, South Africa has a voluntary sustainable agricultural scheme. Here, it is called Integrated Production of Wine (IPW) and certified producers can display their credentials as part of their W.O. seals.\n---"

Historically, the cold temperatures would halt fermentation in winter, resuming only when temperatures rose, sometimes unpredictably leading to wine that sparkled. This phenomenon, initially unexpected and not fully understood, wasn't appreciated until the discovery by Louis Pasteur in 1860 about the role of yeasts in fermentation.\n\n2. **Characteristics of Champagne**:\n   - Champagne is noted for its aromatic complexity, texture, and flavor, which is distinctive to its territory that includes cold temperatures and limestone soils contributing to its unique terroir.\n\n3. **Composition and Production**:\n   - All Champagnes are actually blends of possibly hundreds of different still wines, and mastering the art of blending is crucial among Champagne makers. The secondary fermentation process that occurs in the bottle, involving natural carbon dioxide, is essential for creating the bubbles characteristic of Champagne.\n\n4. **Historical Challenges and Innovations**:\n   - Initially, the effervescence in Champagne was not well-received. Efforts by pioneers like Dom Pérignon in the 17th century focused on refining the wine to reduce its unpredictability and improve its clarity and taste.\n   - The document mentions that earlier Champagnes were often oxidized and heavily sweetened to mask their tartness. An innovation to preserve freshness involved using glass bottles instead of barrels, as wines in barrels were more susceptible to spoilage and easier to tax.\n\n5. **Logistical and Regulatory Aspects**:\n   - Legal and logistical reasons previously dictated that wine be sold in barrels. This facilitated easier taxation and transport, particularly via rivers to major cities like Paris and onward to international destinations like Great Britain.\n\nThis summary captures the primary discussions in the document on the intricacies and historical context of Champagne production."

These micelles make up about one-tenth of the volume of milk. They capture much of the calcium in milk and act as a binder for protein molecules.\n\nThe structure and behavior of casein micelles are influenced by another subset of casein proteins:\n- One portion binds individual protein molecules together into small clusters.\n- A different portion clusters several hundred other clusters together forming a micelle, primarily held together by hydrophobic interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Keeping Micelles Separate**\nKappa-casein is particularly important in preventing the micelles from clustering uncontrollably. It caps the micelles, preventing them from growing too large.\n\n---\n\n**Image Description**\nThe document includes a diagram illustrating the distribution of whey and casein proteins within milk:\n- The diagram shows a fluid with suspended **fat globules**, **whey protein molecules**, **casein protein bundles**, and **dissolved sugars and minerals**.\n- Casein proteins are depicted as larger entities formed from smaller clusters, spread evenly and appear like a mesh structure.\n\n--- \n\nThe passage provided delves into the complex structure and functionalities of milk's protein content and how they contribute to its physical properties and versatility in culinary applications."

    "contenu": "The document contains troubleshooting tips for making yogurt and kefir. Here's a structured breakdown of the advice provided:\n\n### Troubleshooting Yogurt\n1. **Yogurt is grainy**\n   - Cause: Heating the milk too quickly.\n   - Solution: Heat the milk more slowly and gently.\n\n2. **Yogurt tastes burned**\n   - Cause: Likely from high heat.\n   - Solution: Heat the milk slowly and gently, and keep stirring to prevent it from burning.\n\n3. **Yogurt curdled**\n   - Cause: Whey separates from coagulated yogurt due to over-fermentation or high temperatures, a phenomenon known as syneresis.\n   - Suggested fix: \n     - Monitor fermentation duration.\n     - Avoid incubating at high temperatures such as 115°F/46°C for extended periods.\n     - Consider fermenting at a slightly lower temperature or for a shorter time.\n\n### Troubleshooting Kefir\n1. **Kefir is too sour**\n   - Cause: Over-fermentation.\n   - Solution: Culture for a shorter time or use a smaller ratio of kefir grains to milk.\n\n2. **Kefir curdles**\n   - Note: Basically, the same as the problem of kefir being too sour.\n   - Observation: Kefir first thickens, then, as it further acidifies, it can curdle.\n   - Solution: Same as for Kefir being too sour (shorter fermentation time or less kefir grains)."

    "contenu": "## Roussanne - Overview\n\n### Pronunciation\n**roo-sahn**\n\n### Introduction\nRoussanne is a grape that you should definitely know. Sadly, this rich, honeyed grape is quickly disappearing from the vineyards of Hermitage and other appellations in the northern Rhône Valley where it once held court. It is difficult to ripen and grow, and its tendency to oxidize provides vintners with challenges at every turn. Amazingly, even though it comes off as rich and exotic, with an apparent lack of structure that makes it seem as if it's falling apart, it can hold that pose for years, even decades. A permitted component of white Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Roussanne is sharper and more flamboyant than its sibling Marsanne, with which it is paired with in the northern Rhône but separated from in the south.\n\n### Alternative Names\n- Barbin\n- Bergeron\n- Grefon\n- Picotin Blanc\n- Rebelot (France)\n- Rosana (Italy)\n\n### Wine Styles\n- Medium-full to full-bodied dry white\n- Medium-bodied sparkling (not widely available)\n\n### Sometimes Blended With\n- Bourboulenc\n- Clairette\n- Grenache Blanc\n- Marsanne (France)\n- Trebbiano (Italy)\n- Chardonnay\n- Marsanne, Viognier (Australia, U.S.A.)\n\n### Flavor Lexicon\n- **Fruit:** Citrus rind, white cherry, yellow apple, yellow pear\n- **Floral:** Fresh flowers, coffee beans, herbal tea, honeysuckle, sweet citrus blossoms\n- **Other:** Honey\n\n### Similar Sips\n- Viognier\n- Full-bodied fruit-forward Chardonnay\n- rich Sémillon-Chardonnay blends\n\n### Where It’s Grown\n- **Australia** (Victoria)\n- **France** (Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence, Rhône Valley, Savoie)\n- **Italy** (Liguria, Tuscany)\n- **U.S.A.** (California: Sierra Foothills, Sonoma County [Russian River], Southern Central Coast [Paso Robles]; Washington: Columbia Valley)\n\n### Characteristics\nLike its sibling Marsanne, Roussanne is native to France’s Rhône Valley. Roussanne is a more difficult grape to grow and thus has fallen out of favor with growers who seek a predictable crop. It is used, like Marsanne, in small percentages as a blending grape for some of the key wines in the region."
