The method described involves bringing the cooking liquid to a boil, then briefly boiling the meat before reducing the heat and allowing it to simmer gently. This ensures that the meat retains moisture without becoming dry.\n\n### Safety of Leftover Meats\n- It is safer to refrigerate or freeze leftover meats to minimize health risks.\n\n### Offal or Organ Meats\n- The document explains that organ meats (offal), such as livers, kidneys, and intestines, differ from skeletal muscles as they perform different functions in the body and are more rich in certain nutrients.\n\n### Composition of Organ Meats\n\nHere is the structured composition table of various organ meats mentioned in the document:\n\n```markdown\n| Meat           | Protein (%) | Fat (%) | Cholesterol (milligrams) | Iron (milligrams) | Folate (micrograms) |\n|----------------|-------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Standard cuts  | 24–36       | 5–20    | 70–160                   | 1–4               | 5–20                |\n| Heart          | 24–30       | 5–8     | 180–250                  | 4–9               | 3–80                |\n| Tongue         | 21–26       | 10–21   | 110–190                  | 2–5               | 3–8                 |\n| Gizzard        | 25–30       | 3–4     | 190–230                  | 4–6               | 50–55               |\n| Tripe (beef stomach) | 15   | 4       | 95                       | 2                 | 2                   |\n| Liver          | 21–31       | 5–9     | 360–630                  | 3–18              | 70–770              |\n| Sweetbreads    | 12–33       | 3–23    | 220–500                  | 1–2               | 3–70                |\n| Kidney         | 16–26       | 3–6     | 340–800                  | 3–12              | 20–100              |\n| Brain          | 12–13       | 10–16   | 2,000–3,100              | 2–3               | 4–6                 |\n```\n\nThis table provides detailed nutrient contents including the percentage of protein and fat, and amounts of cholesterol, iron, and folate per 100 grams of each type of meat.

The vast, ravishing wilderness here, and tranquil, almost reckless beauty is the California of a century ago. Rolling mountains covered in golden grasses and wild oats alternate with immense stands of giant redwoods. In Mendocino, more than a million acres (more than 400,000 hectares) of forest stand majestically amid the vine-covered, sun-dappled hills. Orchards and ranches are sprinkled over the landscape. On the coast, the windswept town of Mendocino is an artists’ hamlet. Mendocino has the largest percentage of organic vineyards of any county in California—nearly 30 percent are certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers—and countless others are organic but not certified.\n\n### Interesting Fact:\nThe word *mendocino* is a diminutive of de Mendoza, the name of one of the earliest Spanish explorers to come ashore in Mendocino, in the late sixteenth century."

    "contenu": "Here's the structured transcription of the text in the image you provided:\n\n---\n\n### Soaking Grains\n\nThe simplest way to ferment grains is to soak them. Water is the source of all life, and the dry seed is able to persist intact precisely because, in the absence of available water, the microbes inevitably present on the surface of it cannot function or grow. Yet they do remain, dormant until restored to life by water, much like the seed itself. When you soak the grain, it begins to swell, setting in motion a series of changes that, given the right conditions, will result in its sprouting into a new plant. At the same time, water also revives the bacteria and fungi that populate the grain’s surfaces, and initiate fermentation.\n\nGrains benefit from soaking whether whole or already milled. Here we are addressing whole and partially milled grains such as cracked wheat or rolled oats (flour will be addressed later). Use dechlorinated water, in whatever proportion you wish to use for cooking the grains. You can soak grains for just a few hours, if that’s all you have; although pre-digestion will just be getting under way, it’s better than not soaking at all. More pre-digestion will occur faster if you soak grains in warm (body-temperature) water and add some active live cultures—such as a little soaking liquid saved from a previous soak, whey, sourdough starter, buttermilk, or sauerkraut juice—or acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Soak 8 to 12 hours for grains to fully swell, or you can soak for a day or several days to further emergence."

They are then crushed and fermented in stainless steel tanks.\n   - Some wines are lightly fortified with grape spirits (e.g., fino), while fuller styles like oloroso are more heavily fortified.\n\n2. **Aging Process:**\n   - After fortification, the wine is stored in 600-liter American oak barrels for six months to a year to develop initial qualities.\n   - The finished product then enters the solera for blending and further aging until it finally becomes Sherry.\n\n3. **Solera Structure:**\n   - Comprised of multiple rows of barrels stacked one on top of another, usually 4-5 rows high.\n   - Each row represents a different stage of the aging process.\n   - Lower rows hold older Sherry, and small amounts are drawn off for bottling only when there’s a demand (process known as saca).\n   - The barrel emptied during saca is replenished from the barrel directly above it in the stack.\n   - Each barrel filled from the one above ensures a consistent cycle of aging, known as criaderas.\n\n4. **Criaderas Explanation:**\n   - The freshest Sherry is held in criadera #1.\n   - When Sherry is drawn from criadera #1, it’s replaced with wine from criadera #2, and so forth, ensuring a dynamic, continuous blending process.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The solera system is a key element in Sherry’s production, ensuring its unique and varied profile through a methodical and continuous aging and blending process."

Here is a structured summary of the content provided:\n\n### Meat Broths and Stocks\n- **Composition**: Modern meat extracts are typically made by simmering meat scraps and bones in water, then clarifying the solution and evaporating off more than 90% of the water. The final product contains roughly 20% water, 50% amino acids, peptides, gelatin, and other related molecules, 20% minerals (mostly phosphorus and potassium), and 5% salt.\n- **Manufacturing Process**: The gelatin in bone and meat is broken down into smaller molecules through extended initial cooking and pressure-cooking. To avoid browning reactions and preserve light color and roasted flavor, evaporation during processing is kept below 170°F (77°C).\n- **Innovations**: Manufacturers are now creating sauce bases using gelatin extract. These are often sold in the form of demi-glace or glace de viande, enriched with herbs, vegetables, or direct aromatic items to enhance flavor, supplementing what is lost in concentration.\n\n### Fish and Shellfish Stocks and Sauces\n- **Properties**: Fish stocks differ from mammal and bird stocks due to fish bones and connective tissues being less cross-linked, which allows fish collagen to dissolve at lower temperatures.\n- **Specific Observations**: Fish like tilapia dissolve at 77°F (25°C), while cold-water fish gel around 50°F (10°C), allowing for extraction methods that are much gentler compared to those needed for mammalian and bird stocks.\n\n### Wine in Sauce Making\n- **Role of Wine**: Wine is a common ingredient in sauces such as the **Burgundian sauce meurette**, which is made by reducing red wine with meat and vegetables, then thickening with flour and butter.\n- **Flavor Contributions**: Wine contributes acidity, sweetness, savory notes from succinic acid, and distinctive aromas.\n- **Cooking Techniques**: Wine in sauces is usually cooked to evaporate its alcohol and reduce its volume significantly to intensify flavors. The tannins in red wine, which can be astringent, are managed by cooking with protein-rich ingredients that bind to the tannins, reducing the astringency.\n\nThis document is informative in explaining both the ingredients and processes involved in traditional and modern sauce making, with particular emphasis on how physical and chemical properties of ingredients influence the final product."

But lobster has a rich, buttery-tasting flesh that can stand up to a big red wine sauce. You can use whatever red wine you like, but we liked a syrah because it is favored in the Rhône, and the Rhône flows to the sea where lobsters are caught and brought upriver to Lyon, which is the capital of modern gastronomy (roundabout logic but it made sense to us). Generally lobsters are way overcooked. This is a soft way of cooking them beautifully that preserves the silky texture of the meat.\n\nServes: 4\n\n## Sauce\n- 1 cup warm Basic Red Wine Sauce—lobster variation (page 221)\n\n## Gaits\n- 1 cup milk\n- ½ cup water\n- Kosher salt\n- Freshly ground white pepper\n- Pinch ground nutmeg\n- 2½ tablespoons quick-cooking grits\n- 2 tablespoons butter\n\n**Directions**: \nCombine the milk, water, and a pinch each of salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a saucepan and bring to boil.

But while you were \"spiritually\" preoccupied, the wine industries of both Brazil and Peru have been working hard to become players on the South American wine scene.\n\nBrazil now boasts 213,000 acres (86,200 hectares) of vines, and Peru has 43,000 acres (17,400 hectares), although in both countries, per capita wine consumption is low and a modern wine-drinking culture is in its infancy. Indeed, for both Brazil and Peru, a good share of their future success may hinge on their ability to develop international export markets for their wines.\n\nThe largest country in South America, Brazil has a long, though difficult, history of grape growing. The first vines were brought here in 1532 by the Portuguese explorer Martin Afonso de Souza, who planted them in the southeastern state of São Paulo. But even far away from the tropical jungles of the north, the vines perished from disease in the hot, humid climate. Over the next century, many more attempts at grape growing were made, with patchy success, by Jesuit priests hoping to make wine for Mass. A solid wine industry finally took form in the late-nineteenth century, when Italian immigrants began planting American hybrid grapes such as isabella, as well as Italian Vitis vinifera varieties and tantan in the drier mountainous region of the Serra Gaúcha near the border with Uruguay and Argentina, still the key region for fine wines.\n\nBrazil's most important wines include the reds syrah, tannat, malbec, cabernet sauvignon, and tempranillo, but the category that's been hot for decades is sparkling wine. Every type of sparkler is made in Brazil—from traditional-method (Champagne) sparkling wines based on chardonnay and pinot noir to Brazil's version of simple prosecco to tank-fermented fizzy moscato.\n\nThanks to its high altitude and dry, desertlike climate, Peru has many of the viticultural assets of Argentina and northern Chile. Indeed, this may be the most exciting undiscovered wine country in South America, not to mention the most dynamic culinarily.\n\nIn 1528, the Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro and his troops arrived at the northern border of the vast Inca empire, which then included not only Peru but parts of Ecuador, Chile, and the Amazon basin. By 1572, the henceforth named Viceroyalty of Peru belonged to the Spanish crown, and in the years in between, grapevines were introduced both by explorers and priests. Over the next century, as the city of Lima grew and as a mining industry took hold, the production of Peruvian wine increased substantially.\n\nBut an enormous earthquake in the late 1600s, religious suppression in the mid-1700s, the rise in popularity of the spirit pisco, and the demand for cotton, all contributed to the ripping out of vineyards and wine's general decline.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Peruvian wine industry initiated a comeback. The industry is centered around the towns of Pisco and Ica on the Central Coast. Numerous types of red and white wine are made primarily from cabernet sauvignon, malbec, grenache, and barbera, as well as sauvignon blanc and torontel, which, like Argentine torrontés, is a cross of mission and muscat of Alexandria.\n\n---\n\n#### WHEN YOU VISIT... CHILE\n\n**A NUMBER OF CHILE'S top wineries are in the Maipo Valley, just minutes from the capital, Santiago, or a few hours' drive south in the Colchagua and Cachapoal regions, or north of the city, in Casablanca. Do not miss, for example, Lapostolle's stunning estate in the Colchagua Valley or the palatial Cousiño-Macul just minutes from the heart of Santiago. For all wineries, it is best to make an appointment in advance.**\n\n---"

It includes a flowchart and descriptions of various Sherry styles categorized into dry and sweet types. It also discusses the significance of biological and oxidative aging processes in impacting the style and flavor of Sherries.\n\n**Flowchart Description:**\nThe flowchart visually represents the steps involved in making Sherry, starting with two types of grapes: sun-dried PX grapes and Palomino grapes. Here are the steps for each path:\n\n**From Sun-dried PX Grapes:**\n1. Destem and crush\n2. Partial fermentation\n3. Fortification to 17% abv\n4. Oxidative ageing in solera system\n5. (Optional) Add PX\n6. Resulting in Cream PX or Medium PX\n\n**From Palomino Grapes:**\n1. Destem and crush\n2. Press\n3. Alcoholic fermentation (results in dry white wine)\n4. Options following dry white wine:\n   - Fortification to 17% abv, then oxidative aging in solera system leading to Oloroso\n   - Fortification to 15% abv, undergoes first classification, then:\n     - Biological aging in solera system (leading to Fino, further to Amontillado if refortified)\n     - Add PX (leading to Pale Cream if additionally subjected to biological aging with RCGM)\n\n**Styles of Sherry:**\n- **Dry Styles:**\n  - **Fino and Manzanilla:** Solely undergo biological ageing. Noted for citrus and almond aromas and often described as salty, best consumed fresh.\n  - **Oloroso:** Undergoes only oxidative aging, known for rich aromas like coffee, leather, and tobacco. It develops an astringency blended with younger wines.\n  - **Amontillado:** Starts with biological aging followed by oxidative aging.\n\n- **Sweet Styles:**\n  - Characterized by the addition of sweet Pedro Ximénez (PX) or Muscat grapes.\n\n**Regions and Effects:**\n- Wines from Sanlúcar de Barrameda often carry distinct qualities due to cooler, more humid conditions, beneficial for Manzanilla Fino. These wines are noted for their intense tangy aroma.\n\n**Notes on Trends:**\nRecent trends show a preference for minimal intervention in the aging process of Sherries to preserve the vividness of flavors, especially in biologically aged wines. There is also mention of minimal fining and filtering practices, with wines labeled as ‘en rama’ reflecting minimal processing.\n\n**Terminology:**\n- **en rama:** Minimally filtered wines, enhancing the natural characteristics.\n- **RCGM:** This term appears adjacent to biological aging in the flowchart, suggesting a process or additive associated with this stage.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\nThe detailed flowchart and descriptions help delineate the complexities and traditional methods of Sherry production which contribute to the wine's diverse styles and high quality."

Here is a reconstruction of the text:\n\n---\n\n**Cooking Instructions:**\n\n1. **Bacon Preparation:**\n   - In a heavy saucepan, fry the bacon over medium heat until browned and tender, about 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to paper towels to drain.\n   - Pour off all but 1/4 cup of the fat from the pan, add, and return the pan to medium heat. Add the onions and bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to very low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.\n\n2. **Making the Conserve:**\n   - Add the molasses and vinegar, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil. Add the reserved cherry-soaking wine, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the wine has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir in the reserved bacon and cherries and season with salt and a generous amount of pepper. Remove from the heat and keep warm.\n\n3. **Grilling the Chops:**\n   - While the conserve is cooking, prepare a charcoal or gas grill for indirect grilling over a medium fire. In a small bowl, mix together the aniseeds, coriander, pepper, and olive oil. Rub the chops on both sides with the spice-oil mixture.\n   - Oil the grill rack. Arrange the chops on the grill rack directly over the fire and grill for 2 minutes. Rotate the chops 90 degrees to create attractive grill marks and grill for 2 minutes longer. Transfer the chops to a cooler part of the grill, cover the grill, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes for medium, or until done to your liking. Transfer the chops to a wire rack, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 4 to 5 minutes.\n\n4. **Final Preparation and Serving:**\n   - Reheat the conserve over low heat if necessary, and transfer to a warmed serving bowl. Place the chops on warmed plates and serve at once. Pass the conserve at the table.\n   - **Note:** You can prepare the conserve except for stirring in the bacon a few hours ahead of serving. Stir in the bacon just before serving.\n\n---\n\nThis text describes a detailed process for cooking a dish that includes preparing bacon, making a conserve with molasses, vinegar, wine, cherries, and spices, grilling chops seasoned with a spice-oil mixture, and serving these components together. The note suggests that part of the dish can be prepared in advance."

Below are the structured key points covered in the text:\n\n### Shakers\n- **Metal-on-Glass Setup**: Mixing cocktails involves using a metal-on-glass setup where a cocktail is mixed in the glass part and then shaken in the metal part. However, this setup is cumbersome and heavy due to the thermal mass of the glass, making it difficult for one-handed operation unless having strong hands.\n- **Metal-on-Metal Shakers**: The author prefers metal-on-metal shakers (specifically a set of tins: a 28-ounce and an 18-ounce tin). This setup is more manageable because:\n  - It has a lower thermal mass.\n  - It is durable and simple.\n  - It can also function as a strainer in a pinch.\n  - Handles a high volume and can make multiple drinks simultaneously.\n  - After shaking, the tins are separated, unlike lower quality tins which slide against each other without breaking apart.\n  - Previously, finding well-matched tins was difficult, but it has now become easier, ensuring better quality and functionality.\n\n### Strainers\n- **Types Required**: Three different types of strainers are recommended for bar work:\n  1. Julep\n  2. Hawthorn\n  3. Tea\n\nThese tools and techniques reflect essential elements for efficient and effective cocktail preparation, highlighting practical insights on selecting and using the right bartending equipment."

Here's a breakdown of the main points covered in the text:\n\n### Food Pairing\n\n1. **Choice of Dish**:\n   - Dishes with considerable character and elements that can match the robustness of Cabernet Sauvignon are recommended, including steaks, game meats (like ostrich, buffalo, squab, wild pheasant, and wild duck), and dishes with bold ingredients like dark mushrooms and wine reductions.\n\n2. **Importance of Textural Combos**:\n   - Foods with high fat content are suitable since they help tame the wine's tannins. However, the stereotypical \"big wine goes with big cheese\" approach sometimes fails, and moderate cheeses might pair better.\n\n3. **Wine Characteristics**:\n   - Cabernet Sauvignons from different regions exhibit unique characteristics; for example, Bordeaux wines can showcase herbal and forest floor notes suggesting pairings with fresh herbs, dried mushrooms, and sharp vegetables, while those from California might have cedar or cigar-box flavors.\n\n### Cooking Methods\n\n1. **Flavor Profiles**:\n   - The bitter and sharp flavors inherent in Cabernet Sauvignon work well with similar flavors in food; hence, methods like grilling or roasting are recommended.\n\n2. **Suggested Cooking Techniques**:\n   - Cooking techniques that work well with full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignons include stewing, braising, and roasting, which help to soften the wine's tannins and allow the wine to better integrate with the flavors of the food.\n\n3. **Dish Suggestions**:\n   - For mature Cabernet Sauvignon, simple dishes that do not overpower the wine are advised, such as beef stew, uncomplicated pot roasts, or plainly grilled veal or lamb chops.\n\nThe text concludes by emphasizing that with older Cabernet Sauvignon wines (at least eight years old), the pairing should allow the wine to shine through relatively straightforward yet appropriately robust dishes."

It's noted that both wine and olive oil were traditionally stored in such bottles, termed *fiaschi*.\n\n- **Etymology**: According to \"The Oxford English Dictionary,\" the word 'fiasco' meaning \"a failure or complete breakdown\" comes from the Italian phrase *fare fiasco*, which means \"to make a bottle.\" How this phrase evolved to represent a failure is stated as unknown.\n\n- **Cultural Reference**: Some wine experts speculate that the poor quality of past Chianti wine might have contributed to the negative connotation of the term. Mention is made of old trattorias in Tuscany called *fiaschetterias*, initially known for their cheap, hearty Tuscan wines and subsequently famous for their homey Tuscan specialties.\n\n### Summary:\nThe document discusses the term 'fiasco,' its cultural and historical implications, connection to Italian wine culture, and its evolution in meaning from a type of wine bottle to a symbol of failure or breakdown.

It delineates various methods and considerations for producing sweet wines. The content can be structured as follows:\n\n---\n\n### SWEET WINEMAKING\n\nMost wines are fermented to dryness; however, sweet wines contain unfermented sugar and can be made using several methods:\n\n#### Stopping the Fermentation\n- **Fortification**: Addition of grape spirit to halt fermentation while sugar is still present, thus killing the yeast and stopping further fermentation.\n- **High Dose of SO2**: Adding a high dose of SO2 to stop fermentation with some sugar remaining. This wine must then be filtered to remove any remaining yeast to ensure fermentation does not restart.\n- Examples include German **Kabinett** and **Spätlese**, and also some sparkling wines such as Asti from Italy.\n\n#### Adding a Sweetening Component\n- **Germany**: Medium-sweet wines are created by the addition of unfermented grape juice or Süssreserve.\n- **Switzerland**: Süssreserve added to wines ready to be bottled.\n\n#### Concentrating Grape Sugars\n- **Natural Concentration**: Using grapes high in sugar concentration, e.g., Sauternes from Botrytised grapes which have high sugar due to noble rot.\n- **Drying Grapes on the Vine (passerillage)**: Allows grapes to dehydrate and sugar concentrations to increase.\n- **Drying Grapes after Picking**: Grape dehydration after harvest to concentrate sugars.\n- **Freezing Grapes on the Vine**: Grapes are allowed to freeze which concentrates their sugars; example includes making ice wine.\n\n### Noble rot\n- This term refers to the desired fungus Botrytis cinerea, which affects very sweet wines including ones from regions such as Sauternes and Tokaji. The infection leads to the concentration of sugar and flavors in the grapes.\n\n### Botrytis cinerea\n- A key agent in the noble rot process, this fungus punctures the grape skin, allowing water to evaporate and sugars and flavors to concentrate. The resulting wines have distinct honey, apricot, and citrus zest flavors.\n\n### Drying grapes & Freezing grapes\n- **Passerillage**: Grapes are left on the vine to dehydrate naturally.\n- **Drying after picking**: Grapes harvested prior to drying are also used in wines like Amarone.\n- **Freezing on the vine**: Utilizing natural freezing temperatures to concentrate sugars, commonly used in the production of ice wines.\n\nThe document outlines the technical details and geographic considerations involved in making sweet wines that achieve their flavor, sweetness, and aromatic qualities through different controlled processes and natural phenomena."

Build the drink.\n  2. Shake without ice until ingredients are emulsified (creating noticeable sound change and texture).\n  3. Separate the shaker tins.\n  4. Add ice to the small tin.\n  5. Reseal and shake normally.\n\n### DOUBLE SHAKING\n- **Definition**: Shaking each drink individually before moving on to the next.\n- **Process**:\n  1. Shake two cocktails at once using separate shakers for each.\n  2. Ensure a secure grip.\n  3. Shake synchronously but in opposite directions.\n- **Note**: Although it looks unbalanced and awkward, it quickly becomes manageable with practice.\n\n### SHORT SHAKING\n- **Definition**: Shaking a cocktail for a shorter duration, typically for drinks served over ice or topped with something effervescent.\n- **Usage**: Common for collins-style and tiki drinks.\n- **Purpose**: Mix and slightly chill the ingredients without diluting them excessively as they will further dilute when served over ice.\n\n### WHIPPING\n- **Definition**: Shaking technique for cocktails served over a lot of crushed ice.\n- **Usage**: Ideal for swizzles and mai tais.\n- **Process**:\n  1. Use minimal ice (only one cube or a few nuggets).\n  2. Shake just enough to chill and mix slightly.\n  \nEach method described aims to achieve a specific texture, temperature, and dilution, tailored to enhance the drinking experience based on the cocktail’s composition and serving style."
