For these you need a fine-mesh cone strainer, which is basically a small sieve. An inexpensive kitchen sieve will do the trick, but at Death & Co we use strainers created specifically with cocktails in mind. They have a deep cone that will hold an entire drink’s worth of liquid, and their V shape directs the liquid into the glass, instead of spraying it all over the place.\n\n---\n\nThe document is accompanied by two illustrations of cone strainers, emphasizing their design and functionality in cocktail making."

When the purchase cost of a wine is high, the coefficient is kept low to not limit sales. Conversely, when the purchase cost is low, the coefficient can be high. This allows for good flexibility.\n\n- **Fixed Margin:** Instead of applying a coefficient to the wine's purchase price, a fixed amount is added to the price of each bottle sold. Many restaurants and bars apply a margin of €10 per bottle. This system allows offering \"beautiful bottles\" to the customers at acceptable prices while allowing better stock rotation. However, it is still possible to use a fixed margin of €10 on a bottle whose purchase cost is €5 or €80. It is possible to have multiple margins depending on the purchase price.\n\n---\n\nThis content appears to be part of a course or instruction on business aspects of running a wine-related business, focusing on how pricing strategies can be implemented for wine sales in a restaurant setting."

Originating in the Mediterranean during the late Middle Ages, pastries like puff and cream first appeared by the time of La Varenne in the 17th century. The bread-pastry hybrids, which surfaced in the late 19th and 20th centuries, are more recent innovations.\n\n**Pastry Styles:**\n\nPastry styles vary, each distinguished by the texture and particle composition that emerges when chewed:\n\n- **Crumbly pastries**: Examples include short pastry and pâte brisée. These consist of small, irregular particles.\n- **Flaky pastries**: Such as American pie crusts, these pastries separate into thin flakes.\n- **Laminated pastries**: Including puff pastry, phyllo, and strudel, they are made through a process that constructs thin, layered textures capable of shattering into delicate pieces in the mouth.\n\n**Key pastry characteristics:**\n\nThe variation in pastry texture relies largely on the management of fat within the dough to isolate small dough portions or to integrate fat throughout entire dough sheets, facilitating a control over gluten development, thus preventing the creation of a tough and chewy structure.\n\n**Pastry Ingredients:**\n\n- **Flours**: Pastries utilize various flours, optimal for achieving the desired crumbly texture with minimal gluten development. Protein content should be moderate to ensure proper structure.\n\n**Pastry Structures**:\n\nThis section includes graphical representations of uncooked and cooked pastries showing the distribution of fat around and within the dough masses. It details how fat integrates with flour for crumbly, flaky, and laminated pastries, emphasizing the importance of fat in creating light, airy, or flaky structures.\n\n---\n\nThis overview from the document presents a comprehensive understanding of the scientifically intricate yet artistically rich field of pastry making."

For example, an expensive wine like Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon goes well with a high-quality meat like crown rib roast, as opposed to a hot turkey sandwich.\n\n### Principle 2: Match Delicate to Delicate, Bold to Bold\nDelicate wines are overshadowed by strong flavors, and bold wines complement spicy and bold dishes well. For instance, Shirazes are recommended with bold, spicy, and hot cuisines.\n\n### Insight from Peter Barry\nOwner of Jim Barry winery:\n> \"It takes me twelve minutes to eat a good plate of food and two hours to drink a good bottle of wine, so who cares about the food?\"\n\n### Principle 3: Decide if You Want to Mirror a Flavor or Set Up a Contrast\nMirroring involves pairing similar flavors, like Chardonnay with lobster in cream sauce, both creamy and opulent. Contrasting flavors can also bring out unique aspects of each other, such as Champagne with lobster in cream sauce.\n\n### Principle 4: The White-Wine-With-Fish Rule\nMoving away from traditional pairings based on the wine's body matching the meat's body, modern pairings focus more on compatibility of body and components rather than color-specific rules.\n\n### Principle 5: Think About a Wine’s Flexibility\nChardonnay, despite its popularity, is less flexible compared to wines with higher acidity or less tannin. For versatile wine options, consider sauvignon blanc or dry riesling, and for reds, consider Chianti, red Burgundy, or California and Oregon pinot noir."

Below is the structured content of the text:\n\n---\n\n**Title:** QUININE SULFATE USP\n\n**Body:**\nSourcing purified quinine wasn’t easy. Quinine is sometimes used in the treatment of nighttime leg cramps, and until 1994 you could buy it over the counter for that purpose. At the time of my early experiments it was routinely prescribed by doctors. My mom is a doctor! No sweat! “No way,” she said, without hesitation. Besides the obvious ethical violations, she said, there was no way she was writing me a prescription for a potentially harmful medicine that I planned to serve in a cocktail. Apparently consuming too much quinine causes a syndrome known as cinchonism, featuring nasty symptoms that range from simple nausea and dizziness, to the more frightening temporary hearing loss and blindness, all the way up to death from cardiac arrest or renal failure. Luckily, quinine is incredibly bitter and therefore almost impossible to overdose on accidentally—if it is used properly. You’d never willingly drink a cocktail with too much quinine in it, I pleaded. My mom (not surprisingly) turned a deaf ear. I ended up purchasing it from a chemical supply house. You must be extremely careful about what you purchase through a chemical supplier. Many chemicals are sold this way.\n\n---\n\nThe passage provided in the document is accompanied by an image of a hand holding a bottle of quinine sulfate from \"Spectrum.\" This image is not incorporated into the structured content but is described separately here."

    "contenu": "# THE GUMBOOT CLONE\n\nThe Gumboot Clone (*gum-boot* is the New Zealand term for a rain boot), also known as the Abel Clone, is the Kiwis' secret weapon for rich, balanced pinot noir, but it is also a story of intrigue. As it goes, in the 1970s a New Zealand rugby player returning from France tried to sneak pinot noir cuttings into the country in his rain boot (in which case he must have had huge feet). The rumor is that they were cuttings from the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, in Burgundy. The plants were found by a fastidious customs agent named Malcolm Abel, who also just happened to be a grape grower in Auckland. Abel suspected he might have something of real value, and after passing them through customs and quarantine, he planted the cuttings in his vineyards (we can’t vouch for the legality of all this), and shared them with his friend Clive Paton, of Ata Rangi. Abel passed away shortly afterward, but Paton continued to grow the Abel Clone and began turning out stunning pinot noirs. The clone eventually spread across the country, and now accounts for some of the best pinot noirs in New Zealand.\n\n# PINOT NOIR\n\nAs mentioned, pinot noir has proven hugely successful in New Zealand, and in a very short period of time. (Plantings of pinot doubled in the decade between 2003 and 2013.) Indeed, winemakers at top estates like Cloudy Bay, Ata Rangi, and Dry River began experimenting with pinot noir clones only as of the late 1980s, and pinot noir represents such a new phenomenon in New Zealand that growers and winemakers are still discovering the best sites to plant vineyards and the best methods for winemaking.\n\nNew Zealand pinot noir is planted throughout the entire country, but the lion’s share is grown on the South Island. Almost half of this is grown in Marlborough alone, and a significant amount of the rest comes from Central Otago, in the far southern part of the South Island. In general, Marlborough pinot noirs appear to be the fruitier of the two, with nuanced red fruit flavors. They are often used to make sparkling wines, which are very popular in New Zealand, although not often exported. Central Otago pinot noirs, on the other hand, often display an earthiness and wild herb character, which places them stylistically between Old World and New World pinot noirs.\n\nOn the North Island (at the southern tip), the small region of Martinborough also produces stellar pinot noirs whose concentration and depth can be spellbinding. After a 1978 New Zealand government report found the soils of Martinborough to be very similar to the soils of Burgundy, a rush to plant pinot noir vines swept the region, and it now produces some of the best pinot noirs in New Zealand."

    "contenu": "# GROWER CHAMPAGNES\n\nMost wine drinkers are familiar with at least a few Champagnes made by the famous houses. But fewer know or have tasted many of the so-called grower Champagnes. From the top producers, grower Champagnes are distinctive, exquisite, and often mind-blowingly delicious.\n\nGrower Champagnes are, as the name implies, made by small growers, often family firms who make what might be called artisanal Champagnes. Growers do not buy grapes or wine as the houses do. Rather, they make Champagnes exclusively from the grapes they grow themselves. As a result, a grower's Champagne is usually based on a very much smaller number of base wines that are blended together before the wine undergoes the second, bubble-inducing fermentation. Because a grower is using just his own grapes from a small area, grower Champagnes tend to reflect the place where they are made. In a sense, grower Champagnes exhibit what might be thought of as a more Burgundian approach, wherein individual terroirs are prized above all. Among my favorite grower Champagnes are those made by: Pierre Peters, René Geoffroy, Pierre Gimmonet, Gatinois, Doyard, Michel Loriot, Jean Milan, Varnier-Fannière, Chartogne-Taillet, and Jean Lallement.\n\n# THE RIGHT GLASS\n\nEver watch people being handed glasses of Champagne? At least half of them immediately stand up straighter and adopt a sexier tone of voice. The elegant and long-lined Champagne glass is about as sophisticated as glassware gets.\n\nTall, tulip-shaped glasses evolved from conical glasses made between 1300 and 1500 in Venice. These, in turn, were inspired by some of the earliest drinking vessels, such as animal horns. Serendipitously, the art of glassmaking was reaching its apex just as Champagne making was at its pivotal beginnings. By the late seventeenth century, Venetian glassmakers were capable of creating fragile goblets that possessed remarkable clarity. Historians theorize that the transparent beauty of such glass may have been one of the considerations that ultimately led winemakers to develop techniques for making crystal-clear, sediment-free Champagne.\n\nTall Champagne glasses allow the wine’s bubbles to swell as they rise in long, spiraling streams to the surface. However, the glass should be slightly wide in the middle so that a bowl is formed within which aromas can congregate. (Severely narrow flutes are not ideal Champagne glasses.)"

Here’s a structured summary of its content:\n\n### Main Points\n1. **Introduction to Wine Aeration**:\n   - Aeration or breathing is vital for many wines, particularly when poured into a large glass, carafe, or decanter to mix with oxygen.\n\n2. **Wine Types and Aeration Effects**:\n   - Young, tannic red wines like cabernet sauvignon, merlot, nebbiolo, and petite sirah enhance their flavors upon exposure to air.\n   - White wines also benefit, opening up through oxygen exposure.\n\n3. **Process of Aeration Versus Decanting**:\n   - Aeration often confuses with decanting which is slightly different and involves oxygenation through pouring and exposure.\n\n4. **Methods of Aeration**:\n   - Simply uncorking a bottle and letting it sit opened for a few minutes is generally insufficient.\n   - Vigorous methods like swirling the wine in the glass are recommended for effective aeration.\n\n5. **Wines Sensitive to Oxygen**:\n   - Some wines deteriorate when aerated, such as older pinot noirs, red Burgundies, older gran reserva Riojas, and Chianti Classicos.\n   - These wines should not be aerated as they can become dull and lifeless.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe text underscores the importance of understanding how different wines react to aeration and highlights methods for aerating wine effectively to enhance its flavors without causing damage."

    "contenu": "The document discusses two primary aspects of wine packaging and how they convey certain attributes about the wine itself:\n\n1. **Wine Label Design**:\n   - **Target Audience**: Labels with whimsical designs, including cartoon images, usually target beginners and convey an approachable, fun aspect of the wine, potentially indicating fruity flavors and slight sweetness.\n   - **Style and Sophistication**: More modern and stylish labels that avoid cutsiness, often found on wines from fruit-forward regions like California and Chile, are indicative of a New World style that focuses on sophistication and food pairing finesse. Traditional labels, which often feature simple scripts, a crest, or a winery scene, suggest an Old World style and carry connotations of prestige and quality, though they are widely imitated.\n\n2. **Type of Packaging**:\n   - **Screw Tops and Bottle Material**: The use of high-tech packaging such as stelvin-lined screw tops rather than traditional corks, and extra-heavy bottles specifically for red wines, generally suggests a modern approach that might favor vibrant, clean fruit-driven flavors. These modern approaches are less likely to lend a wine earthy or rustic characters.\n   - **Glass Color and Clarity**: Traditional wine bottles usually use dark brown or green glass to protect the contents from light damage which might degrade the wine. However, contemporary wineries opting for clearer glass bottles are likely creating wines intended to appear more refreshing and crisp, suitable for wines like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, which are dry whites.\n\nThis nuanced understanding of wine packaging not only informs potential consumers about what to expect from the wine but also serves as a marketing tool to distinguish wines in a competitive market."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various cooking methods, their effects on food, and the science behind them.\n\n### Steaming\n- **Method**: Cooking vegetables at boiling point without using a pot of water, instead using steam directly.\n- **Benefits**:\n  - Preserves flavor, color, and nutrients by avoiding water.\n  - Allows control over saltiness, acidity, and tannins.\n  - Ideal for chlorophyll-rich plant cells.\n- **Requirements**: Food should be arranged in a single layer, loosely packed to allow steam access.\n\n### Pressure Cooking\n- **Method**: Cooking using pressurized steam, especially useful for low-acid foods.\n- **Temperature**: Food cooks at around 250°F/120°C rather than 212°F/100°C.\n- **Benefits**:\n  - Encloses water vapor, raising the boiling point which cooks food more rapidly.\n  - Prevents overcooking and retains freshness.\n\n### Hot Air, Oil, and Radiation: Baking, Frying, and Grilling\n- **Method**: Removes moisture from the food, concentrating flavor and generating browning reactions.\n- **Details**:\n  - **Baking**: Uses air, which is less dense than oil, heating food more slowly and evenly.\n  - **Frying & Sautéing**: Often called \"oven frying,\" uses oil to heat food more quickly and contribute to flavor through browning and other reactions.\n- **Temperature**: Typical oil temperatures range from 325–375°F/160–190°C.\n- **Benefits**: Richer flavors due to surface browning and reaction products.\n\n### General Concepts\n- **Moist vs. Dry Heat**: Dry heat methods like baking, frying, and grilling intensify flavors and colors due to browning reactions. Moist methods like steaming and pressure cooking generally preserve food's natural flavors and textures but don't induce browning.\n\nThis summary highlights the distinct culinary techniques discussed in the document with their respective benefits and scientific principles, which offer insightful knowledge for culinary practices involving edible plants."
