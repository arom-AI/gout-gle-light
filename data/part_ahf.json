A half-finished bottle will never taste the same the next day, let alone a week later. If we want to preserve opened wine, we must take steps to protect it. Unlike vodka or vinaigrette, wine cannot be sealed up and expected to remain unchanged.\n\nWine is not inert; its flavor begins to shift as soon as the seal is broken. Wine changes as it matures at the winery and ages in cellared bottles. It even changes while in the glass as we drink it. These chemical changes irreversibly alter the wine itself, not simply our perception of it (as service temperature or food context might). Most of these changes are driven by exposure to air and the oxygen it contains.\n\nMany gadgets and treatments on the market claim to preserve opened wine by blocking or slowing the impact of oxygen. However, none are capable of making wine taste exactly as it did on pulling the cork, and even those products that are effective will not work indefinitely. Wine is a volatile, organic product and never \"stands still.\"\n\n---\n\n**About Ronn Wiegand**\n\nRONN WIEGAND is both a master of wine and master sommelier, the first in the world to hold both prestigious titles. A widely published author with thirty-five years of wine industry experience, he is founder and publisher of the hospitality journal *Restaurant Wine*. His *TasteTour* series of intuitive wine guides and charts are recognized as essential tools of the trade. In 2008, he introduced a line of lead-free crystal wineglasses of his own design, the Signature Series from Germany’s Eisch Glaskultur. He also offers consulting services and has been a wine instructor at Napa Valley College since 1988.\n\n---\n\n**Footer**\n**162 WINE SECRETS**"

Grahm, known for his pioneering methods and the use of atypical grape varieties, advocated for a shift from Chardonnay to warmer climate varietals better suited to California's Mediterranean climate. This included varieties from the Rhône, Spain, and Italy. His initiatives and influence have inspired various American vintners to adopt and explore non-traditional grape varieties and techniques.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Randall Grahm's Influence:**\n   - Introduced and promoted the use of Rhône, Spanish, and Italian grape varietals in California.\n   - Advocated for replacing substantial Chardonnay acreage with these varietals.\n   - Noted for his shift from traditional packaging and closures to more innovative approaches.\n\n2. **Legacy and Innovations:**\n   - Grahm's introduction of varieties like Syrah and Grenache has significantly diversified American wine styles.\n   - His efforts culminated in new plantings and the introduction of less common grapes such as Freisa and Teroldego.\n\n3. **Other Influential Vintners:**\n   - **Jim Clendenen (Au Bon Climat)** and **Bob Lindquist (Qupé)** have successfully experimented with varieties like Vernaccia, Arneis, and Barbera in Santa Barbara County.\n   - **Bob Haas (Tablas Creek Winery)**\n     - Known for his planting of Châteauneuf-du-Pape varietals leading to renowned red and white blends.\n   - **Michael Havens**\n     - Started experimenting with Albariño in Napa Valley before its popularity spread outside northeastern Spain.\n   - **Marimar Torres**\n     - Focused on Tempranillo clones in Sonoma's Green Valley.\n   - **Rudy von Strasser**\n     - Advocated for Grüner Veltliner in Napa Valley's Diamond Mountain area.\n\n4. **Emerging Trends by Region:**\n   - **Earl Jones (Abacela Winery, Oregon)**\n   - **Doug McCrea (McCrea Cellars, Washington State)**\n     - Both challenged regional norms by incorporating Rhône and Mediterranean varieties.\n\nBy promoting diverse grape varieties suited to California's climate, Randall Grahm and his contemporaries have played pivotal roles in the evolution and enhancement of North American winemaking."

These are produced by flour and yeast enzymes in unbalanced amounts during intense mixing and high-temperature proofing.\n\n---\n\n**Special Kinds of Loaf Breads: Sourdough, Rye, Sweet, Gluten-Free**\nBakers make distinctive variations on the basic loaf bread from a variety of grains and other ingredients. Here are brief descriptions of some of them.\n\n**Sourdough Breads**\nSourdough breads are known for the acidity in both the dough and bread, which is a result of the activity from various yeasts and bacteria that grow in the dough, often including the same lactic acid bacteria that convert milk into yogurt and buttermilk (p. 44). The sourdough process starts with a \"wild\" starter made from natural microbes present on grain and in the air, mixed with water. This blend of yeast and bacteria is maintained by saving a portion of the dough to leaven the next batch of bread.\n\n**Historical Context**\nInitially, breads likely resembled traditional sourdoughs, involving specific starters that give distinct regional flavors. These starters help the bread resist spoiling and going stale. Sourdoughs tend to be less colorful but more flavorful and maintain their quality longer due to slower browning reactions and strong acid conditions.\n\n**Modern Sourdough Cultivation**\nModern techniques focus on limiting bacterial growth and encouraging a healthy acidification. This involves keeping the starters cool and refreshing them frequently by adding new flour and water and aerating them.\n\n---\n\n**Frozen and Par-baked Doughs and Breads**\nBread dough can be frozen after it has risen and is partially baked (known as \"par-baked\"). This allows for a shorter final baking time in a hot oven. Although freezing can kill many yeast cells and reduce the dough's leavening power, it is typically not a concern because the necessary leavening occurs before freezing. Sweet rich doughs are notably better suited for freezing than other types."

    "contenu": "The document contains detailed advice regarding wine etiquette and proper tasting techniques as listed below:\n\n### 2. When the Bottle is Presented and Opened, Don’t Smell the Cork. Wait and Smell the Wine.\n- **Explanation**: The act of smelling a wine cork is deemed unnecessary as the cork’s smell—often like tree bark soaked in wine—does not reliably indicate the wine's quality. Many wines have imperfections that aren't detectable from the cork's aroma, and sometimes good wines might come with corks that smell off. Moreover, with the presence of screw tops and synthetic cork alternatives in many modern wines, it's recommended to focus solely on the wine itself.\n\n### 3. When a Taste is Poured for You, Swirl the Wine in the Glass and Sniff.\n- **Technique Description**: Swirling wine in a glass isn’t just for show but serves a practical function by enhancing the wine’s scent. The suggested method involves holding the glass base firmly, moving it in circular motions without splashing the wine. Using the glass stem like a pencil, drawing spirals on the tablecloth can help in spinning the wine efficiently inside the glass to increase its surface area.\n- **Resulting Benefit**: This action coats the bowl's inside with wine, which increases its aroma due to more surface exposure. After swirling, it is advised to take one or two good sniffs to fully appreciate the wine's aroma.\n\nThe document includes an illustration showing the technique of swirling a wine glass to intensify its aroma."

    "contenu": "The document provided discusses two main topics: \"Polyphenol Astringency and Proline-Rich Proteins\" and \"Booze Washing.\"\n\n### Polyphenol Astringency and Proline-Rich Proteins\n\nThis section explains how the astringency of polyphenols is tied to their interaction with proline-rich proteins (PRPs) found in saliva and other sources. These proteins have a strong affinity for polyphenols due to large amounts of the amino acid proline. This interaction makes the polyphenols less digestible, presumably as a defense mechanism by plants against being eaten. Salivary PRPs bind polyphenols to reduce their astringency and anti-digestive characteristics. The passage mentions that unlike carnivores, omnivores (including humans) do consume PRPs in their diet through different sources such as milk protein (casein), egg whites, and gelatin. These compounds are used in a process called booze washing to reduce astringency in alcoholic beverages.\n\n### Booze Washing\n\nThis section describes a technique for refining the flavor of spirits by removing unwanted harsh or overpowering flavors without stripping the beverage of its fundamental qualities. Traditional methods like using activated charcoal are not the focus here; instead, the document stresses selectively moderating the less desirable tastes while maintaining the drink’s core flavors. Examples given include moderating the harshness of bourbon or the astringency of black tea vodka by diluting them or adjusting their ratios rather than completely removing their flavors. This method, called booze washing, aims to enhance the drinkability of cocktails by balancing flavor without sacrificing the integrity of the base spirit.\n\nOverall, the document provides insights into the science behind beverage flavor modification through the understanding of polyphenol-protein interactions and practical applications in improving spirits through booze washing."

It has none of the carefree abandon of, say, Tuscany; none of the sunny energy of the Napa Valley. Indeed, for all its joyfulness as a wine, the region itself has been continually torn apart by tragedy, especially during World Wars I and II, when it was a gruesome battlefield. As a result, there's a soulfulness here that's as palpable as the dazzling bubbles in every glass you'll have.\n\n**Of Champagne's Two Most Important Cities**\n- **Reims:** Boasts many of the great houses, including Ruinart, Veuve Clicquot, and Taittinger. Home of the majestic underground cellars called crayères. Reims is also the location of the Cathedral of Reims, site of the coronations of French kings. Don't miss Maison Fossier in the center of the city, founded in 1756, famous for its Biscuits Roses de Reims, tiny, crunchy, pink-colored biscuits traditionally eaten by first dipping them in Champagne.\n\n**The Smaller Town of Epernay**\n- Epernay is considered the unofficial capital of Champagne. Here, along the Rue de Champagne, are the side-by-side gleaming mansions and cellars of Perrier-Jouët, Möet & Chandon, and Pol Roger. Just outside the town is the Abbey of Hautvillers, where Dom Pérignon lived and worked.\n\n**Formality in Bordeaux and Champagne**\n- Similar to Bordeaux, Champagne has a formal atmosphere, making it mandatory to have an appointment to visit the Champagne houses. It is noted that wearing running shoes might feel out of place, suggesting the importance of dressing appropriately for visits."

The bud's surface is later mashed to initiate sap flow, which continues until the bud rots, making it easier to extract the liquid.\n   - **Outcome**: The sap, called aguamiel, can be consumed directly, fermented into pulque, or boiled to produce syrup.\n   - **Unique Attributes**: Pulque, characterized by its flavor and slimy texture, is noted to have a unique taste influenced by the presence of Bacillus species, and is described as both sweetish and acidy, yet refreshingly different from beers and wines.\n\n2. **Production of Mezcal from Agave Plants**:\n   - **Method**: Harvesting and roasting the agave stems or \"hearts\".\n   - **Details**: The roasted stems are mashed, mixed with water, strained, and then boiled. Post-cooling, the mixture ferments rapidly in about four to five days.\n   - **Outcome**: This process results in the creation of mezcal, a distilled alcoholic beverage.\n\n3. **Fermenting Sap from Deciduous Trees in Poland**:\n   - **Specifics**: Particularly popular with birch sap which is tapped in early spring.\n   - **Outcome**: The sap ferments into a lightly alcoholic drink called oskola.\n   - **Additional Information**: The document mentions experimentation with diluting and fermenting maple syrup into alcohol, although without as much success as with other saps.\n\nEach section not only describes the technical processes but also provides insight from individuals like Henry Bruman and Diana Kennedy, adding qualitative assessments of the resulting beverages' characteristics and flavors."

Here is a structured representation of the main points from the document:\n\n1. **Homofermentative vs. Heterofermentative LAB**:\n   - Homofermentative bacteria are specialized to tolerate low pH (high acidity).\n   - Early stages of vegetable fermentation often show heavy CO2 production, attributed to heterofermentative LAB activity. This activity acidifies the environment, leading to a shift towards acid-tolerant homofermentative LAB, such as *Lactobacillus plantarum*.\n   - The success of the sauerkraut fermentation depends on the symbiotic relationships between heterofermentative and homofermentative lactobacilli.\n\n2. **Role of LAB in Food Preservation**:\n   - Lactic acid produced by these bacteria is effective in inhibiting the growth of spoilage-inducing bacteria.\n   - This principle is supported by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization in their report \"Fermented Fruits and Vegetables: A Global Perspective\".\n   - Lactic acid fermentation is a key strategy for food safety and preservation as it is not limited to plants; LAB are diverse and ubiquitous.\n  \n3. **Importance of LAB in Human Health**:\n   - LAB are among the first bacteria newborns are exposed to, indicating their prevalence.\n   - Exposure to LAB continues through breast-feeding, and every person is in contact with these bacteria via various means throughout life.\n   - Continuous exposure is crucial since everyday factors, including antibacterial chemicals, can diminish LAB populations in our bodies.\n\nReferenced works include a UN Report, \"Fermented Fruits and Vegetables: A Global Perspective\", and a mention of the book \"The War on Bacteria\" in the context of maintaining healthy levels of beneficial bacteria in the human body."

In Sonoma’s Dry Creek Valley, home of some of the state’s oldest vines, Zinfandel is characterized by a deep jammy and briary fruit character and an underlying peppery and spicy perfume. Up in the Sierra Foothills, Zins have a distinct mineral quality, with an inky anise flavor and an almost iodine-like intensity that is enthralling. Those from the vineyards surrounding the Southern Central Coast’s Paso Robles and the Northern Central Valley’s Lodi subappellations have a warm and ripe dark-cherry personality and a pleasant herbal spiciness. California Zinfandel, regardless of origin, is not for the faint of heart: almost all these Zins are high in both tannins and alcohol. Although there are smatterings of Zin in Washington and undoubtedly parcels in other states, California drives the Zin engine in the United States.\n\nBut Zinfandel is not a solely American phenomenon. Primitivo is increasingly available from the south of Italy, either as a 100 percent varietal (as in the stunning Primitivo di Manduria) or blended with other local red grapes. These wines have the same implicit rustic character as their American counterparts, but with an underlying rusticity and flavor palate that screams, “I’m Italian!”\n\nRegarding the rest of Europe, I haven’t had the pleasure of tasting many Zinfandels from Slovenia, Croatia, or elsewhere in Central Europe, but I am told by connoisseurs whose mouths I respect that these wines are clearly of the same quality as the Italian Zins. With increased financial investment and continuing winemaking improvements, these bottles will be seen with greater frequency outside Central Europe.\n\nI have tried examples from Western Australia and South Africa, and I believe that this grape has a very bright future in both countries. Finally, I have been told of a few “suitcase clones” of Zinfandel in warmer parts of France! Yes, Zinfandel in France.\n\nA table of principal wine-growing regions for Zinfandel appears on page 285.\n\n*Suitcase clones (or Samsonite clones) is winespeak for grapes propagated from cuttings smuggled into a country in a grower’s suitcase. While it is illegal in most countries to import vines this way, and the risk of spreading disease and viruses is real, some wines made from these contraband selections have been delightful and complex, and they are extremely difficult for the agricultural quarantine officers to trace."

They were fairly small and sturdy and you didn’t care if you broke one because they were cheap. (The good glasses—the Waterford crystal ones—were safely ensconced, still in their original boxes, up in the attic, where they’d been since your wedding day when you got them.) Then came the 1990s and a new word entered the wine vernacular—Riedel. Georg Riedel, the tenth-generation head of his family’s Austrian crystal company, was a wine connoisseur. A man of strict and impeccable standards, Riedel had begun designing crystal wine glasses that would enhance the aromas and flavors of various varietals and types of wine. He soon became famous for his “Riedel Glass Tasting,” in which the same wine was tasted in various glasses, and consumers and wine pros around the world were invited to judge the results. Winemakers and restaurateurs were especially convinced of the efficacy of Riedel glasses, and within a few years, no top winery or restaurant was without them. Riedel's success caused dozens of other top Austrian (Zalto) and German (Eisch, Schott Zwiesel) crystal companies to come out with competing lines of high-quality wineglasses. Today, no self-respecting wine lover thinks twice about having a cabinet full of good wineglasses and using them daily.\n\nFinally, Austria’s top wine districts possess infertile, eroded, well-drained soils. Sand, gravel, slate, and loam are common, as are loess (fine sediment caused by wind-blown silt) and gneiss (foliated metamorphic rock with coarse mineral grains arranged in bands)."

Severe cases can lead to respiratory failure and potentially death.\n\n3. **Distinction Between Canning and Fermentation**:\n   - Fermentation utilizes native microbial communities to ensure food safety, while canning uses high heat to kill all microorganisms, including those involved in food spoilage and foodborne illness.\n   - Canning is particularly susceptible to botulism because the spores of *C. botulinum* can survive the high temperatures used during this process unless extremely high temperatures are achieved in a pressure cooker.\n\n4. **Heat Resistance of Botulinum Spores**:\n   - *C. botulinum* spores can withstand high temperatures; eliminating these spores requires temperatures above the boiling point of water (240° to 250°F/116° to 121°C), achievable in a pressure cooker at 10 to 15 pounds per square inch.\n   - At normal boiling point, destroying these spores can take extraordinarily long (up to 11 hours). The persistence of these spores in non-acidic mediums is notably challenging. \n\n#### **Key Takeaway**:\nThe document highlights the critical considerations for preserving food safety through various methods while underscoring the particularly resilient nature of *C. botulinum* in food preservation scenarios."

Below is an organized summary of the content:\n\n---\n\n### SUN-DRIED GRAPES GROW SWEETER AS THEY RAISINATE AND MAKE SWEET WINES WITH A “NUTTY” CHARACTER\n- **Description**: This section explains a warm-climate method of drying grapes in the sun after harvest to concentrate their flavors, mimicking late-harvest concentration.\n- **Details**: Once dried, the grapes may oxidize and turn brown, leading them to have a nutty flavor. This is typical for wines like Vin Santo and Sherry.\n- **Food Pairing**: Foods that share a caramelized or nutty character, like French onion soup or fried foods, go well with these wines. Sweet wines from sun-dried grapes are also recommended with nutty desserts like pecan pie.\n\n### FORTIFIED WINES HAVE EXTRA ALCOHOL ADDED TO BOOST BODY, OFTEN TO RETAIN GRAPE SWEETNESS\n- **Description**: Discusses another method used in warm climates to make sweet wines by adding alcohol to the wine during fermentation to stop the process and retain some natural sweetness.\n- **Details**: The example given is Port, which combines wine, grape juice, and brandy, giving it a robust, grapey and alcoholic flavor.\n- **Food Pairing**: Due to its strong character and sweetness, Port is best paired with potent flavors like chocolate and blue cheese.\n\n### MARNIE'S CORNER: PAIRING DESSERT WINE WITH DESSERT\n- **Key Insight**: The challenge in pairing dessert wines with desserts is managing the sweetness levels to avoid overpowering flavors or creating a disharmonious taste.\n- **Advice**: The sweetest wines should be paired with the sweetest desserts (e.g., crème brûlée) because both enhance each other's flavors. Less sweet wines should be paired with low-sugar desserts like biscotti to balance the taste.\n\n### General Recommendations\n- **Wine and Food Matching Logic**: Pairing wine with food, especially desserts, requires careful consideration of flavor intensity and sweetness to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured format summarizes the key points and the specific knowledge shared about wine pairing, particularly with an emphasis on sweet wines and their interaction with food dishes."

Here's a structured analysis and summary:\n\n### Shellfish and Their Toxins\n1. **Chemical Warfare in Algae**: The document mentions that at least 60 species of single-celled algae (dinoflagellates) produce defensive toxins. These toxins can poison human digestive and nervous systems, and some toxins are lethal.\n   \n2. **Dinoflagellates and Filter Feeders**: Humans typically ingest these toxins by consuming animals that directly consume dinoflagellates, such as clams, scallops, and oysters. These marine creatures concentrate the algae’s toxins in their tissues.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Shellfish Poisoning**: Many countries monitor their waters for algae and shellfish toxins to manage the risk, which primarily comes from shellfish gathered privately.\n\n4. **Cooking and Toxins**: The document notes that ordinary cooking does not destroy the toxins from dinoflagellates, and in some cases, the toxins can become more potent when heated.\n\n### Specific Types of Shellfish Poisoning\nThe document also lists different types of poisoning caused by shellfish, organized in a table format:\n- **Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning**: Occurs in Japan, Europe, and Canada, commonly caused by mussels and scallops containing Okadaic acid.\n- **Amnesic shellfish poisoning**: Found along the U.S. Pacific coast and New England, involving mussels, clams, and Dungeness crab with Domoic acid.\n- **Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning**: Occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida from consuming clams and oysters with Brevetoxins.\n- **Paralytic shellfish poisoning**: Seen in the U.S. Pacific coast and New England, involves clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, and cockles containing Saxitoxins.\n- **Ciguatera poisoning**: Found in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and the South Pacific, involves consuming barracuda, grouper, snapper, and other reef fish with Ciguatoxin.\n\n### Parasites in Shellfish\n- **Nature of Parasites**: Parasites in shellfish are described as larger or multicellular organisms (not bacteria or viruses) that can be harmful to human health. They can be transmitted when consuming raw or undercooked fish.\n- **Prevention**: It is recommended to cook the fish and shellfish to an internal temperature of 140°F/60°C, or freeze it between -31°F/-35°C for 15 hours to kill the parasites.\n\n### Shellfish to Avoid\n- The document suggests that it is safest to avoid suspect shellfish entirely to prevent poisoning. However, it mentions some tropical reef fishes that do not accumulate toxins, such as barracuda, groupers, jacks, and snappers, except they can still cause ciguatera poisoning.\n\nThis content outlines crucial information for consumers and regulators involved in the seafood industry to ensure public health safety concerning shellfish consumption."

Here's a structured summary:\n\n### Introduction\n- **Solubility and Nutrient Extraction**: Cooking fruits and vegetables in water does not extract chemicals very efficiently because they're not very soluble. However, cooking disrupts plant tissues, allowing for better extraction of nutrients. Adding fat can improve the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients.\n\n### Methods of Cooking\n- **Overview**: Cooking methods can be categorized into three groups: \n  1. **Water**: Methods that transfer heat via water.\n  2. **Dry**: Methods that transfer heat via air, oil, or infrared radiation.\n  3. **Miscellaneous**: Methods that involve restructuring the food or extracting essences.\n\n### Hot Water: Boiling, Steaming, Pressure-Cooking\n- **Simplicity and Effectiveness**: Boiling and steaming are straightforward and effective for cooking vegetables because they require no judgment of cooking temperature; water boils at 100°C at sea level. Both methods are good for rapid cooking while minimizing nutrient loss.\n- **Process Details**:\n  - **Hot water** dissolves and extracts pectin and calcium from cell walls, which softens the vegetables more thoroughly.\n  - **Steam** leaves these compounds in place, softening vegetables more slowly and gently.\n- **pH and Hardness Consideration**: For boiling, it's optimal to have a slightly alkaline (pH 7–8) and soft water to avoid dulling chlorophyll. Acidity and calcium in hard water slow the softening process.\n\n### Specific Tips for Cooking Starchy Vegetables and Combinations\n- **Handling Starchy Vegetables**: They need different treatments to prevent over-softening. Adding salt can reinforce cell walls, improving texture but potentially damaging the exterior.\n- **Combination Cooking**: When vegetables are cooked with meat (as in stews or braises), they should be either pre-cooked or added at an appropriate time to ensure they do not overcook or undercook compared to the meat.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Adapting Techniques**: Adjust techniques based on the specific needs of the vegetables and the overall dish to achieve desired textures and flavors."

This helps the yeast ferment more sugar, which results in wine that is fuller in body and higher in alcohol. However, it is mentioned that although this method can increase alcohol content, it can lead to wines that have unbalanced and subdued flavors.\n\n2. **Geology and Soil Types:**\n   - Burgundy is distinguished by its limestone and limestone-rich clay soils, notably found in the Côte d’Or and Chablis regions. These soils contain visible sea fossils and reveal vast blocks of fractured limestone under a minimal layer of topsoil, dating back to the Kimmeridgian period of the Jurassic epoch. Such geological features contribute significantly to the vivid minerality observed in both red and white Burgundy wines.\n   - The document also refers to Anthony Hanson, who wrote about the soil in his book on Burgundy. It mentions that during the Jurassic period, 135-195 million years ago, the region experienced significant geological transformations, including the deposition of marine sediments and growth of animal life such as baby oysters and other marine organisms, contributing to the limestone that boosts the quality of Burgundy's wines.\n\n3. **Viticulture:**\n   - The document hints at more information to be discussed about the grapes and the modern wine revolution post-1950s, suggesting an in-depth exploration of viticultural practices and their evolution.\n\nOverall, the document is informational and discusses practices, geological history, and environmental factors that collectively define and influence the quality and characteristics of wines from Burgundy."

The steep, terraced vineyards make the work hard and slow.\n\n**Text Content:**\n\nPortugal, like its Iberian neighbor, Spain, is carpeted with vineyards—almost 600,000 acres (242,800 hectares) of them. In fact, although the country is just 370 miles (595 kilometers) long, 125 miles (200 kilometers) wide, and smaller than the state of Kentucky, it nonetheless ranks tenth in world wine production. Seventy-nine different grape varieties grow here, many of which can be found in the Douro alone. Many of these varieties are quite ancient and were probably brought to Portugal from Phoenicia (modern-day Lebanon) or Anatolia (Turkey), which were among the primary domestication sites for vines in the Old World. (As is true for Spanish grape varieties, Portuguese varieties are thought to be genetically distinct from varieties in France and Italy.) Since those early times, Portuguese vines have had to struggle formidably to survive. The varieties that exist today, for example, have through natural genetic mutation, adapted to the dry, severely hot climate and impoverished landscape, and are surprisingly capable of producing well-balanced, elegant wines despite the climate challenges. For an explanation of Portuguese wine law, see the Appendix on Wine Laws, page 925.\n\n---"
