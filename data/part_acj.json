The condition was resolved with fluid and electrolyte treatment within 12 to 24 hours.\n\n4. **Cooking and Pre-cooking Advice**:\n   - It’s advised to boil beans for 5 to 10 minutes in salted water before eating or fermenting them to neutralize phasin.\n\n5. **Discussion on Bean Varieties and Fermentation**:\n   - Some dried beans contain toxic anti-nutrients, which are detailed in another chapter (referenced as chapter 11).\n   - Despite concerns, fermentation usually alters harmful substances into benign or even nutritious forms.\n   - The author mentions experimenting with pre-cooking beans as suggested by Kaufmann and Schöneck, but retains some skepticism about the effectiveness.\n\n6. **Final Opinion**:\n   - While acknowledging the toxin phasin and adhering to some precautions, the author remains critical of the overall risk based on personal experience and broader scientific literature.\n\n---  \n\nThis structured summary captures the key points and concerns raised in the document about the consumption of raw and dried beans and the potential health risks associated with phasin."

Here is the content detailed:\n\n---\n\n### Temperature\n\nRegardless of the color of wines, all are kept at the same temperature. However, the red wines are consumed when warm and white wines are consumed when cold. A too cold white wine will have a weak flavor and a too warm red wine will tend to be more alcoholic. Red wine should be given time before consuming for the temperature to rise and white wine is best when chilled before consumption.\n\nHence, it is paramount to store the wines correctly to preserve the flavors. Fluctuating temperatures can vary the taste of wine. Temperatures between 50 and 55 degrees are perfect to allow the wine flavor to mature. Wine cellars are the ideal storage place to maintain the quality of wine, a cool basement or a kitchen refrigerator can also serve the purpose.\n\n---"

It explains how wines might change their character when paired with food and over the course of consumption.\n\n3. **Cork taint is the most common cause for wine to be rejected; such wines are said to be \"corked.\"**\n   - Explains the phenomenon of cork taint, commonly referred to as \"corked\" wine, which is typically identified by an offensive smell likened to a mildewed basement. This section clarifies that cork taint is due to the presence of TCA (trichloroanisole), which can stem from the cork itself or from treatments used on corks. It mentions that opinions differ on what percentage of wines are affected by cork taint but emphasizes that flawed wines are more often consumed than returned. It suggests consulting a wine steward if there is any doubt about the wine’s condition.\n\nThis structured breakdown serves to educate restaurant patrons on the nuances of wine tasting and handling, promoting a more informed and proactive approach to wine selection in dining settings."

Here's a breakdown of the main topics discussed in the document:\n\n1. **Early Beginnings (1700s - 1800s):**\n   - **Fray Garcia de San Francisco y Zúñiga:** This priest played a fundamental role in cultivating the first grapevines in California, specifically a variety known as \"listán prieto,\" which was later called \"mission\" grapes. These were part of the efforts to have wine for Eucharist celebrations.\n   - **Missions and Vineyards:** Missions from Baja (\"Lower\") to Alta (\"Upper\") California were established. Each mission had its own vineyard. These vines originated from Mexico and were first brought over by Spanish settlers and explorers including Hernan Cortés.\n   - **Independence and Change:** The territory, referred to as Alta California when under Spanish and later Mexican control, was ceded to the United States in 1846 following the Mexican-American War, becoming part of the U.S. as the State of California in 1850.\n\n2. **California Gold Rush Era (Mid-1800s):**\n   - **Shift from Mining to Agriculture:** Post-Gold Rush, European immigrants turned to agriculture, including viticulture. This shift was influenced by the exhaustion of mineable gold.\n   - **Notable Figures in Viticulture:**\n     - **Agoston Haraszthy:** A Hungarian aristocrat who established Sonoma’s Buena Vista winery in 1857, making it the oldest continuously operating winery in the U.S. He was famously known as the \"Father of California Wine,\" importing numerous grape varieties.\n     - **Gustave Niebaum:** A Finnish sea captain who expanded into the wine industry after thriving in fur trading.\n\n3. **Image Description:**\n   - The image in the document shows a police officer uncovering a stash of liquor and wine in a New York hotel during the circa 1930, probably relating to Prohibition era activities.\n\nThis document provides a concise look at key historical developments that shaped California's wine industry and highlights significant contributors to the viticultural success in the region."

It covers several points:\n\n1. **Location and Scenery**: The image at the top shows a villa in Bolgheri, on the western coast of Tuscany under a moody sky, indicating a notable wine region.\n\n2. **Historical Challenges**: Post-war economic measures led to an increase in funds for agricultural development which were utilized to expand Chianti vineyards. To quickly meet the demand for affordable Chianti, numerous vineyards were planted with different types of Sangiovese grapes, including varieties from the neighboring Emilia-Romagna, which were not typically known for producing premium red wine.\n\n3. **Decline in Quality**: This rapid expansion and the use of unsuitable clonal types, combined with overproduction and the use of weaker, less flavorful white grapes significantly compromised the quality of Chianti wine. \n\n4. **Perception and Marketing**: By the 1970s, the allure of Chianti wine was largely associated with its packaging, notably the straw-covered bottles, rather than the quality of the wine itself. This reflects a broader trend of marketing influencing consumer perception of wine quality.\n\n5. **Cultural Reference**: The narrative points towards a shift from the authentic quality of the wine to a more superficial appeal based on romance and marketing. The description indicates a move away from the traditional heritage and quality that Chianti once represented.\n\nThis document outlines critical issues faced by the Italian wine industry in the late 20th century, such as the tension between quantity versus quality and the impact of marketing on the legacy of historical wine regions."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\" contains information on different aspects related to cheese, including its diversity, factors affecting its flavor, and considerations for choosing, storing, and serving it. Here’s the structured content of the discussed sections:\n\n### The Sources of Cheese Diversity\n- **Ingredients and Conditions Creating Diversity**: Traditional cheeses are made from a variety of hundreds of plants (ranging from scrubland herbs to alpine flowers), dozens of animals (feeding on those plants), and are transformed into milk. This milk is incorporated with protein-cutting enzymes and thistles, microbes from different environments like meadows, caves, oceans, and animal insides, and benefits from animal skins.\n- **Human Skills**: Observation, ingenuity, and good taste from generations of cheesemakers and cheese lovers have contributed to the heritage of cheese-making, which underlies even today’s simplified industrial cheeses.\n- **System of Organization**: Cheeses are organized into a comprehensible system based on moisture content, which affects the ripening duration and the flavor development of the cheese.\n\n### Cheese Flavors from Proteins and Fats\n- **Process of Flavor Development**: \n  - Enzymes from milk and rennet along with microbes break down concentrated protein and fat into a wide range of flavor compounds.\n  - Proteins such as casein are broken into pieces called peptides and eventually into amino acids. These acids can further degrade into a variety of more savory or sweet-smelling components.\n  - Fats are broken down into fatty acids by enzymes and particular microbes (like Penicillium roqueforti). Some enzymes are added to specific cheeses like Pecorino and Provolone to intensify certain flavors or aromas.\n- **Components Contributing to Flavor**:\n  - Volatile fatty acids transform into ketones which intensify the moldy (cheesy) aroma.\n  - Copper cauldrons used in the making of cheeses like Swiss and Parmesan can damage some milk fat directly and enrich the aroma.\n  - Esters, which are derivatives from interactions between fatty acids and alcohols, add exotic aromas like pineapple and coconut.\n\n### Choosing, Storing, and Serving Cheese\n- **Historical Context**: Choosing a good cheese has always been complex and important, as indicated by an old medieval compendium of maximums and recipes taught to Charlemagne, emphasizing the significance and detailed knowledge involved in handling cheese."

    "contenu": "The text discusses various aspects of chocolate including its types, storage, production methods, and its cooling effect when consumed. Here's the structured content presented in the excerpt:\n\n### Types of Chocolate\n- **White Chocolate**: Described as chocolate-less chocolate because it contains no cocoa particles or chocolate flavor. It's made from a mixture of purified, usually deodorized cocoa butter, milk solids, and sugar. It contrasts with ordinary chocolate and has a relatively short shelf life at room temperature.\n\n### Packaging Innovations in Chocolate\n- Some manufacturers are experimenting with packaging nibs or small pieces of roasted beans, which offer intense flavor. Whole roasted beans can also be found in Latin markets.\n\n### Storage and Fat Bloom in Chocolate\n- **Ideal Storage Temperature**: 60–65°F (15–18°C). This helps prevent melting and recrystallization of cocoa butter fats, which can lead to a fat bloom.\n- **Fat Bloom**: Explained as a powdery-looking coating due to melted cocoa butter that has migrated to the surface, forming new crystals. This is generally prevented by proper tempering and can be slowed by adding substances like clarified butter, which randomizes the fat molecule formation.\n\n### Cocoa Powder\n- Cocoa powder is made from cake residues left after extracting most of the cocoa butter. It remains coated with a thin layer of cocoa butter and contains about 8 to 26% of this solid content. It's characterized by a strong flavor and pronounced acidity, having a pH of around 5.\n\n### Dutch Process Cocoa\n- Known as \"Dutched\" or alkalized cocoa, particularly common in Europe and the U.S. This method involves treating cocoa beans with an alkaline substance like potassium carbonate, which was pioneered by a Dutch chocolate manufacturer. This process raises the pH and alters the chemical composition of the beans.\n\n### Chocolate's Cooling Effect\n- Well-made chocolate has a unique property of feeling cool in the mouth. This is because it melts slightly below body temperature, and its solid phase absorbs heat energy from the mouth without significantly raising the temperature of the chocolate itself."

    "contenu": "# THE RHÔNE\n\nIf I had to name France’s three greatest regions, I would say: Bordeaux (for the aristocracy of the best wines made there); Burgundy (for what it teaches us about elegance in wine); and the Rhône (for the uninhibited, fearless, almost savage flavors that the top wines possess). There is no question that among the world’s greatest red wines, Rhônes are the most untamed. Their howlingly spicy, dark flavors can seem almost caged, ready to explode with fierceness. Rhônes are the wine equivalent of a primal scream.\n\nThe Rhône Valley takes its name from the Rhône River, which begins high in the Swiss Alps and flows into France through the canyons of the Jura Mountains. South of Lyon and just north of Ampuis, where the vineyards begin, the river makes a sharp turn and plunges southward for 250 miles (400 kilometers) until it washes into the Mediterranean, just west of Marseille.\n\nThe valley is divided into two parts: the northern Rhône, smaller and a bit more prestigious, and the southern Rhône, larger and better known. It takes about an hour to drive between the two, and along the way, you see only patches of isolated vineyards. In fact, the northern and southern Rhône are so distinct and different that, were it not for the river that connects them, they would almost certainly be considered separate wine regions.\n\nIn both the north and the south there are multiple wine districts, or appellations. The most renowned northern reds are Côte-Rôtie and Hermitage; the most famous southern red is Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The popular, well-priced wines known as Côtes-du-Rhône—staples in French cafés and many others worldwide—can come from either part of the valley, although most come from tracts of vineyards in the south.\n\n### THE QUICK SIP ON THE RHÔNE\n\nTHE RHÔNE VALLEY in southeastern France is divided into two parts: the northern Rhône and the southern Rhône. Wines from each are distinctly different.\n\nRED WINES DOMINATE THE REGION, although whites and rosés are also made in the Rhône. The most famous northern Rhône reds are Côte-Rôtie and Hermitage; the most famous southern red is Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nSYRAH IS THE SOLE RED GRAPE in the north. Southern Rhône reds are usually blends of many grapes, the most important of which are grenache and mourvèdre.\n\nAlthough twenty-seven varieties of grapes are grown in the Rhône Valley, only a handful of these are of major importance. The others—many of them grapes that have grown in the Rhône for centuries and are simply inter-planted with the main varieties—are today used almost nostalgically, to add nuance and what winemakers sometimes call the flavors of tradition. As a matter of law, each appellation specifies which of the twenty-seven grapes can be used within its borders (see The Major Appellations, Wines, and Principal Grapes of the Northern Rhône, page 241, and The Major Appellations, Wines, and Principal Grapes of the Southern Rhône, page 249).

    "contenu": "The document titled \"SUGAR CANDIES AND CONFECTIONERY\" deals with various properties and behaviors of sugar in candy making processes including the boiling of syrup and its concentration as well as a traditional method known as the cold-water test that evaluates sugar syrup concentrations. Here’s a structural breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Document Title\n**SUGAR CANDIES AND CONFECTIONERY**\n\n### Content Sections\n\n#### 1. Boiling Point and Sugar Concentration\n- The section discusses how the boiling point of sugar syrup increases as the concentration of dissolved material in the syrup (such as sugar) increases. It mentions a specific example: a syrup that boils at 250°F/125°C is approximately 90% sugar by weight.\n\n#### 2. Cooking the Syrup Raises the Sugar Concentration\n- As water in a sugar solution boils away, the concentration of sugar increases. This causes a continuous rise in the syrup's boiling point. To achieve a syrup of specific sugar concentration, one must heat a mixture of sugar and water until it boils and maintain that boiling state.\n\n#### 3. Specific Boiling Points and Sugar Concentrations\n- At various sugar concentrations, the boiling point of the syrup differs significantly: \n  - 235°F/113°C for about 85% sugar (used for sauces and taffy)\n  - 270°F/132°C for about 90% sugar (used for fudge)\n  - 300°F/149°C and above, nearing 100% sugar (used for brittles and hard candies)\n\n#### 4. The Cold-Water Test\n- Describes a traditional method used by confectioners involving cooling a small sample of syrup quickly and observing its behavior in cold water to estimate its concentration. Thinner syrups form a thread, while more concentrated syrups form a pliable ball in cold water.\n\n### Accompanying Graph\n- Title: **Syrup Boiling Points Depend on Sugar Concentration**\n- Description: A graphical representation showing how the boiling point of a sugar solution increases with the concentration of sugar. Percentages range from 0% to 100%, with corresponding boiling points ranging from just above 200°F to 340°F as concentration increases.\n\n### Graph Data\nThe graph plots the boiling points in degrees Fahrenheit against the percent sugar by weight as follows:\n- Starts from just above 200°F at 0% sugar\n- Gradually rises with increasing sugar concentration\n- Shows a steep increase past about 60% sugar, reaching up to 340°F at 100% sugar\n\n--- \n\nThis document is primarily informative, providing detailed insights into the behavioral characteristics of sugar syrups used in confectionery, including practical aspects such as how to cook syrups to desired sugar concentrations and how to quickly estimate sugar concentration using the cold-water test."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n**Valdo’s Numero 10 and Bellanda’s SC 1931**, but they are the exceptions, because aging the wine in bottles suppresses the primary-fruit character that is the hallmark of this wine.\nMany winemakers employ only the Prosecco grape in their wines, though the law requires only 85 percent Prosecco, with the balance made up of the early-ripening Bianchetta, the aromatic Perera, and the sharp and acidic Verdiso. The blend is less critical than the final style of the wine, which falls into one of three categories of sweetness: brut (driest), extra dry, and dry (sweetest). As with Champagne, there’s some overlap in the sugar levels in these categories, so you can theoretically have a brut that’s sweeter than an extra dry. I discuss below how to pair these different categories with food.\n\nProsecco’s charm, like that of Asti, is the freshness of its fruit. It’s best to drink it soon rather than to cellar it as you might a good bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine. Unless you are having a party or hedging the value of the euro, there’s no need to stash cases in your basement. For similar reasons, it’s probably not worth hunting for vintage-dated Prosecco. Although most Prosecco is made from the wine of a single harvest, it’s rarely vintage-dated. It’s best for the wine (and for the winery’s finances) to get the bottles to market as quickly as possible. When wineries do produce a vintage-dated Prosecco, the primary reason is so that they can charge more for it, trading on the popular assumption that a vintage wine is always better and worth a higher price. With Prosecco, this isn’t the case.\n\n### Pairing with Food\n\nIf ever a wine was created to harmonize with the food of its home region, it is Prosecco. It pairs beautifully with the famed specialties of the Veneto, especially wild game, spit- or oven-roasted or cooked into stews accompanied by polenta. Further enriching the local cuisine are mushrooms: porcini (or *cepes*, as the French call them), the *chiodino* or honey mushroom, and various members of the chanterelle family. These mushrooms are often paired with sweet chestnuts. The fleshiness of the mushrooms and the texture and sweetness of the chestnuts enhance the fruit character of the Prosecco.\n\nDon't think of Prosecco as a cheap alternative to Champagne. Prosecco shares Champagne’s bubbles and food-friendliness but little else. Champagne is all about toast and chalk, lean citrus, and long, expansive finishes. Many of its complex signature notes derive from autolysis, the process of the spent yeast breaking down in the bottle after secondary fermentation. Prosecco is more about a balance of ripe fruit and sweetness than about complexity and nuance.\n\nI’d guess that most Prosecco is enjoyed at the beginning of a meal, a decision that suits the wine just fine. It’s very good with snack foods, from roasted almonds to Chex Mix (really!), and from sweeter sushi to basic antipasti or salumi. You've got a wide choice of appetizers, too, as Prosecco is a solid match with dishes ranging from crab and shrimp salads to Chinese potstickers.\n\n---"

Older vintages may carry former names, tokay or tokay-pinot gris.\n   \n6. **RIESLING**\n   - **Description**: Considered the most prestigious grape in Alsace, capable of remarkable complexity and aging potential, also suitable for late-harvest wines.\n   \n7. **SYLVANER**\n   - **Description**: A minor grape capable of making very good wines in Alsace, particularly when the sylvaner vines are old; identical to the grape silvaner in Germany.\n\n### RED\n1. **PINOT NOIR**\n   - **Description**: Alsace's only red grape, minor but capable of producing fascinating wine occasionally.\n\n### Additional Explanation on GEWÜRZTRAMINER\n- Explanation discusses the polarizing nature of gewürztraminer (compared to nebbiolo). It highlights its heritage, its robust flavors ranging from lychee to marmalade, and its growing conditions primarily in Alsace and occasionally in Italy’s Trentino-Alto Adige region. Gewürztraminer is pointed out as a mutation of the ancient grape savagnin, rooted in northeastern France and southwestern Germany. The wine's acidic balance is highlighted as crucial for maintaining its bold flavor, particularly in the vendange tardive (late harvest) style, which can be especially impactful."

For sake of brevity, I've provided two examples. The dots (🟢) indicate favorable pairings with the corresponding wines spanning across the headers. Each row represents an ingredient with the suitable wine type indicated by the colored dot under each wine category."
