On the east is the Saône River valley, on the west, the Monts de Beaujolais, a mountainous spur of the Massif Central. The climate is continental, with cold winters and hot, mostly dry summers. The region is divided in two. The northern (Haut) Beaujolais is where the highly desirable granite soils are found. All ten of the Cru Beaujolais villages are located in the north. The southern (Bas) Beaujolais is dominated by sedimentary rock and clay soils. Basic Beaujolais tends to come from vineyards in the south."

I didn't consider it an exciting prospect. In those years, hotel restaurants, for the most part, were rather perfunctory affairs that catered to road-weary hold guests and distracted power-lunchers. As restaurant critic for the *New York Times*, however, I was compelled to check it out—fully expecting to flee after the first bite of dessert.\n\nSurprisingly, though, the menu looked intriguing—then again, I had been ambushed by florid prose many times. At that time, so-called fusion cooking was not yet the gastronomic buzzword it is today, although a few chefs were experimenting with melding Asian ingredients with classic American and French cuisine. Yet this was the first menu I had seen that approached it with such passion and authority. To be honest, I don't recall every detail of that meal, but I clearly remember my first taste sensation. It was a dish of grilled jumbo shrimp set in a shallow pellucid pool of shrimp stock. Yet the dish itself was infused with a flavor that was new to me, the kaffir lime. These bitter aromatic leaves defined and bolstered the sweetish broth, in the same way oak tannins frame a fine old Bordeaux.\n\nAnother startling creation, for both its flavor and texture, was a triple-decker of deboned quail that was layered with sweet taro-root chips and lustrous, perfectly seasoned creamed leeks. At the conclusion of this extraordinary meal I asked our captain for the name of the chef. Gray Kunz. Never heard of him.\n\nI may not have known his name but I sure knew that this was the standard by which fusion cooking would soon be measured. After subsequently tasting the efforts of some other chefs, it was clear that one could not embrace this refined technique by cookbooks alone. The nuances of his Eastern flavors are revealed most subtly to those who have lived with them, as Gray had, from his childhood in Singapore.\n\nIn 1991 he moved to the St. Regis Hotel, literally across the street from the Peninsula, to take over its lavish restaurant, Lespinasse. For the first time I...\n```"

    "contenu": "The document discusses the complexities and nuances of tracking and understanding wine producers and vintages in Burgundy. It mentions the difficulty in remembering names given many producers may share last names or are related. For instance, it highlights the village of Chassagne-Montrachet, where multiple producers have the last name \"Morey\" or \"Ramonet\" and the importance of taking precise notes on the producers' names to revisit their Burgundy wines.\n\n**Key details include:**\n- **Producers in Chassagne-Montrachet:** \n  - Three with the last name Morey (Domaine Bernard Morey, Domaine Jean-Marc Morey, and Domaine Marc Morey).\n  - Two with Ramonet in their name (Domaine Ramonet and Domaine Bachelet-Ramonet).\n  - Four with the name Gagnard.\n\nThe document also touches on vintages in Burgundy, explaining that due to the region's coolish, rain-prone continental climate, site variations, and soil types, there is significant variability in wine characteristics from year to year. Nonetheless, it argues that categorizing vintages as simply \"great\" or \"poor\" is reductive; vintages should instead be viewed within a spectrum of moods influenced by various factors.\n\n**Additional information:**\n- **Bistro Mention:** \n  - Ma Cuisine in Beaune, where chef Fabienne Escoffier writes her daily menu on a blackboard including dishes like roast pigeon and boeuf Bourguignon.\n- **Vintage Perspective:**\n  - François Millet, the winemaker at Comte Georges de Vogüé, shares a perspective that vintages reflect various \"moods\" of the wine, ranging from exuberant to shy, making each year unique and not strictly classifiable into binary categories.\n\nThe document uses these examples to display the rich and varied wine culture in Burgundy, emphasizing the importance of deeper understanding and appreciation to fully enjoy what the region offers."

They appear after the main portion of the batch is removed.\n- **Research Note**: Initial attempts to reproduce Tibicos were unsuccessful without freshly picked fruit, hinting at the specificity of certain conditions or fruit varieties, like those of the Opuntia.\n\n### Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society - 1899\n- **Findings on Tibi grains by M. L. Lutz**:\n  - **Description**: Spherical translucent masses resembling boiled rice-grains, varying in size.\n  - **Composition**: Composed of bacilli and yeasts.\n  - **Fermentation**: Produces a light agreeable beverage from sugar-water, aided by lemon juice for acidity and inoculation.\n  - **Process Dependency**: Requires cooperation between two organisms (bacilli and yeasts); either alone is insufficient.\n\n### Life of Yeasts - 1978 Reference on Tibi\n- **Described as \"Tibi Konsortium\" and identified as Swiss**:\n  - **Product**: A sour, weakly alcoholic, carbonated liquid.\n  - **Ingredients**: Made from a 15% cane sugar solution with dried figs, raisins, and a bit of lemon juice.\n  - **Microbial Components**: Capsulated bacterium and a yeast that live symbiotically.\n  - **By-products**: Lactic acid, alcohol, and CO2.\n  - **Propagation**: Tibi grains capable of multiplying and transferring to subsequent batches for continued fermentation.\n\n### Additional Insights\n- The author had challenges understanding that water kefir is referred to as Tibicos.\n- Mentions other similar cultures such as \"ginger beer plant\" used in England, implying a variety of localized versions and adaptations of similar fermentative cultures.\n\nThis synopsis aims to clearly represent the academic and experiential observations found in the document, tying together the scientific study with practical applications in beverage fermentation."

There's an illustration depicting various stages of white wine production, emphasizing \"particularités bordelaises\" (specific characteristics of Bordeaux).\n\n- **Wine Making Process**:\n  - **White Wines**: Dry white wines in Bordeaux are made from grapes that have both skins and juice which are white, avoiding extraction of tannins or color, which is typical in red wine production.\n  - **Quality**: High-quality wine production demands fully ripe and healthy grapes.\n  - **Pre-Fermentation Maceration**: In Bordeaux, there is a focus on pre-fermentation maceration for white wines to maximize aromas and prime flavors.\n  - **Addition of Sulphur Dioxide**: Before fermentation, sulphur dioxide is added to the must to select yeasts over other microorganisms and protect the must from oxidation.\n  - **Clarification and Racking**: Particles causing murkiness settle down due to low temperature, and the must is then racked to clarify and separated from sediments in a process called \"débourbage\".\n  - **Alcoholic Fermentation**: It occurs at 18-20°C and generally lasts for about 12 to 15 days to ensure preservation of aromas.\n  - **Post Fermentation Handling**: After alcoholic fermentation, sulfur dioxide is added for stabilization. Malolactic fermentation, which declassifies the wine, often happens in Bordeaux - typically inside stainless steel tanks or potentially in barrels.\n  - **Maturation**: Wine is often matured on lees in the Can increase flavor complexity.\n\n- **Current Status**: Currently, white wines account for approximately 8% of Bordeaux's total wine production, showcasing modern winemaking techniques and expertise. Every step from cultivation to bottling is monitored closely to prevent oxidation and maintain low temperatures, ensuring the expressive quality of flavors.\n\nAdditionally, the document includes an educational or informational image illustrating the process flow from harvesting to bottling of Bordeaux wines, underlining the controlled steps involved predominantly in the white wine vinification process."

But when we set out to write our own, we realized that very few bar books actually teach readers how to make and create a tasty, well-balanced cocktail and explain why certain tools, ingredients, and techniques are best for any given drink.\n\nThese two questions—**how?** and **why?**—are the secrets to Death & Co’s success, and our bartenders ask them constantly: How can we make drinks more efficiently and consistently? Why should we use this kind of ice over that one? How can we make a better Manhattan? Why are four rums better than one? When we opened the bar, we scrutinized every norm, convention, and lesson we’d been taught and threw out anything that didn’t hold up. And as soon as we figured out a better way to make a drink—or found a better bottle of gin—we put it to the test. Before any drink earns a place on our menu, it’s subjected to numerous rounds of tasting, tweaking, substitution, collaboration, and improvement. This book contains the collective knowledge of the Death & Co staff, amassed over seven years and tens of thousands of hours of practice and introspection, and we’re excited as hell to share it with you.\n\nThis book is intended for anyone with a passion or curiosity for cocktails, from seasoned professionals to novice home bartenders. We want to share our enthusiasm for our craft and the ingredients, tools, techniques, and creativity essential to it. Each chapter builds upon the previous chapter’s lessons. In **Chapter 1**, “A Night at Death & Co,” we show you what goes into creating and running a world-class bar. In **Chapter 2**, “Building a Bar,” we’ll introduce you to many of the key ingredients we use at our bar. **Chapter 3**, “Building a Drink,” covers the tools and techniques that help us do our job consistently and efficiently, night after night. **Chapter 4**, “Creating New Classics,” demystifies the process of inventing new cocktails. Then, once you’ve learned how to work and think like a Death & Co bartender, we give you hundreds of original recipes in **Chapter 5**, “The Specs,” along with recipes for our favorite classic cocktails. Throughout the book, you’ll be engaging with various aspects of cocktail making emphasized in each chapter."

In that vast nation, each province is associated with specific vegetable ferments. Some of the styles call for starters, including **chiang**, similar to Japanese miso, and **qu**, the Chinese mixed fungal and bacterial culture essential to rice beverages and many other ferments (see [Chapter 10, Growing Mold Cultures](#)). Some styles are dry-salted, while others are fermented in brine. Some vegetable ferments use thin rice gruel (**congee**) as a medium, or add starchy water that has been used to wash rice.^23\n\nChina has an incredible array of specific regional styles, of which I know very little. The most descriptive information I’ve found in English comes from the writings of an English woman, Fuchsia Dunlop, who studies Chinese cuisine. In her book on Sichuan cuisine, _Land of Plenty_, Dunlop writes:\n\n> \"Pickled vegetables are fundamental to the spirit of Sichuan cooking. Every household has its **pao cai tan zi**—a rough earthenware pot with a rounded belly and narrow neck, and a lip that functions as a water seal. In the darkness within, crunchy vegetables soak in a pool of brine, with a splash of rice wine and a selection of flavorings that probably include brown sugar, Sichuan pepper, and ginger, with a few pieces of cinnamon stick, cassia bark, and star anise. The vegetables come and go, replenished every day or two with fresh supplies, but the pickling brine, or mother brine, is reused.\"\n\n---\n\nThis text discusses the inspiration and cultural significance of various fermentation techniques and tools used in Chinese pickling, with particular focus on regional diversity and practices such as the use of **pao cai tan zi** in Sichuan cuisine."

One part of Baden is in central Germany, not all that far from Würzburg; another is on the Bodensee (Lake Constance) near Switzerland; and the biggest and most important part runs parallel to the Rhine from Heidelberg all the way south to Basel.\n\nThe southern part of this stretch—roughly from Basel to the famous spa town Baden-Baden—is where the very top wines are to be found. Immediately west of this district is France’s Alsace region, and to the east, the Black Forest. In particular, wines from the area around the Kaisertuhl (literally “emperor’s throne”), an extinct volcano, are prized.\n\nThis is one of the warmest vineyard areas in Germany, and the wines taste like it. By German wine standards, they’re very bosomy, big-bodied quaffs with considerable alcohol and only modest acidity. They are galaxies away from the Mosel wines in spirit and style.\n\nThe leading grape in Baden is Müller-Thurgau, which makes wines for everyday drinking. You’ll also find grauburgunder (pinot gris), guttedel (chasselas), silvaner, weissburgunder (pinot blanc), gewürztraminer, spätburgunder (pinot noir), and of course, riesling. (Very little of the latter is grown.)\n\nThe largest number of Baden wines are made by cooperatives (four out of every five growers sell their grapes to co-ops). The leading co-op is Badischer Winzerkeller. Even by cooperative standards, it is mammoth, making more than one-third of all of Baden’s wine.\n\nBaden is more famous for its food than for its wine. The forests of Baden abound with game, berries, and wild mushrooms. In particular, venison, country bacon, and ham from the Black Forest are legendary, as are preiselbeeren (a kind of small, sweet-tart cranberry) and heidelbeeren (huckleberries). Many Baden dishes combine kirsch, cream, and tart cherries, including, of course, the sine qua non of Baden cooking: Black Forest chocolate cake.\n\nAmong the top producers of Baden wine are Dr. Heger, Salwey, and Bercher."

    "contenu": "# INTRODUCTION\n\nCHEFS DON'T CREATE FROM RECIPES. They create from tastes. They create in the same way that a composer “hears” notes in the concert hall of the mind before anyone plays them on the keyboard. Kitchen artists draw on the knowledge acquired through years of study, long practice, and a generous dollop of intuition. If chefs are like composers in general, they are very like one composer in particular—Antonio Vivaldi. As a teacher in a foundling home for girls in Venice, his task each year was like that of a chef at the market: he could concoct his musical stew only with the materials at hand. If his star students played flute, oboe, and bassoon, he would write a piece for what was then an unusual combination of instruments. If the young ladies were more adept at guitar, he would dash off a slew of guitar pieces. Presumably if there had been a powerhouse conga drummer in the class, his oeuvre would certainly have included a concerto for harpsichord, lute, and conga.\n\nChefs work the same way: they start with the best of what is available and then turn to their intuition and their memories to figure out what might be done with those ingredients. A recipe may spring from a survey of the pantry, a trip to the refrigerator, a walk through the market, the memory of the smell of bacon on Sunday morning or of sage after a morning rain. As any fan of Hemingway or Proust knows, taste memories are among our strongest and most evocative. It was the memory of the taste of one little madeleine dissolved in a cup of tea that sent Proust careening through the next three thousand pages of remembrances. Had his memory been jogged by a complex dish like a bouillabaisse, he might have written his way through another foot of two of out bookshelves.\n\nLike Proust's evocative memories, a chef's memories of taste lie at the base of any new recipe. You have a taste in your mind, an idea that it would go well cooked in a certain way or combined with a certain herb. Then you try that idea. You add ingredients and seasonings, reduced pan juices, maybe some lemon juice or wine, honey or sugar. Like a composer, you look for themes, motifs, and—most important—harmonies."

    "contenu": "The document presented discusses two significant aspects related to cereal doughs and batters: the process of kneading and fermentation.\n\n### Kneading\n- **Purpose**: Kneading strengthens the gluten network within the dough. It involves pressing, stretching, folding, and compressing the dough multiple times which aligns the proteins further and encourages bonds between glutenin molecules.\n- **Effects**:\n  - Develops strong end-to-end bonds within molecules, creating a cohesive network.\n  - Makes the dough stiffer and less sticky as more kneading occurs.\n  - Traps air, forming numerous smaller air pockets which improve the texture of bread.\n- **End Result**: Over-kneading can make dough too stiff and inelastic, being a problem primarily when done mechanically. Minimal kneading, on the other hand, results in doughs with larger air cells and a coarser structure but less developed gluten.\n  \n### Fermentation or Rising\n- **Process Description**: This stage begins when dough is set aside to allow yeast cells to produce carbon dioxide. The gas slowly inflates air pockets within the dough, aiding in its rise.\n- **Temperature and Time**:\n  - Optimal yeast activity occurs at 95°F/35°C, but more noticeable quantities of by-products form at a fermentation temperature of 80°F/27°C.\n  - Usually takes a couple of hours, though can be extended for enhanced flavor development.\n- **Effects**:\n  - Yeast activity increases dough volume and develops gluten matrix further.\n  - Fully fermented dough feels softer to touch and easier to handle.\n  - Dough doubles in volume and shows signs of full fermentation when it doesn’t spring back after being poked.\n  \n### Additional Note:\n- **Food Words: Knead**: The term \"knead\" originates from an Indo-European root meaning \"to compress into a ball.\" Related words include \"gnocchi\", \"quenelle\", \"knoll\", and \"knuckle.\"\n\nOverall, kneading and fermentation are crucial stages in the preparation of cereal doughs, impacting texture, structure, and flavor development."

    "contenu": "### Unfermented Dairy Products\n\n#### Butter and Margarine\n\n**Introduction**  \nButter making, traditionally, was an essential process in the early days of dairying. In ancient times, even before the fashionable era, separating fat from milk was a common practice, discovered during the early dairying days. This practice has been important from locations ranging from Scandinavia to India, where nearly half of all milk production goes toward butter for both cooking and ceremonial purposes.\n\n**Modern Innovations**  \nThe occasional mishap in cream dishes in modern kitchens often leads to unintentionally making butter. Nowadays, butter is considered an \"everyday miracle,\" as described by poet Seamus Heaney. The process involves churning, where milk or cream damages the globules, and the fat starts to stick together, eventually forming butter. This rich, creamy substance, he described, is \"coagulated sunlight” heaped up like gilded gravel.\n\n**Historical Context**  \nDuring the 19th century, the development of the mechanical cream separator and other advancements like refrigeration changed butter production. By around 1870, a shortage of butter in France due to the increasing demand led to the invention of margarine from an array of cheap animal fats and vegetable oils. This product is now more consumed in the United States and parts of Europe than butter itself.\n\n**Making Butter: A Detailed Process**  \n1. **Preparation**: Butter is made by concentrating cream to 36-44% fat which is then pasteurized. In the U.S., this usually occurs at 185°F. After cooling, the cream may be inoculated with lactic acid bacteria for cultured butter.\n   \n2. **Churning**: The cream is then cooled to about 40°F/5°C and aged to allow the fat to crystallize. This helps in gathering the fat globules during churning. The size and number of these crystals determine how quickly and completely the milk fat separates, influencing the final texture and flavor of the butter.\n\n**Cultural Impact**  \nThe rise of butter in various cuisines, especially in Europe, illustrates its significant cultural impact. In regions like Normandy and Brittany, butter became especially renowned for its quality, being used from sauces to pastries. The butter was commonly made on small farms from pooled cream, typically sour and often slightly fermented."

They come from two small trees in the citrus family sometimes called “prickly ash.”\n- Sichuan pepper trees are *Zanthoxylum simulans* or *Z. bungeanum*, and sansho trees are *Zanthoxylum piperitum*.\n- The spices are small dried fruit rinds, aromatic with lemony citronella and citronellol. \n- The pungent compounds, sanshools, are members of the same family as piperine from black pepper and capsaicin from chilis. \n- Sanshools produce a strange, tingling, buzzing, numbing sensation similar to the effect of carbonated drinks or a mild electrical current (akin to touching a nine-volt battery to the tongue).\n\n#### Chinese and Japanese Versions\n- The Chinese and Japanese versions of this spice are different:\n  - Chinese Sichuan peppercorns are always toasted, enhancing their citrus affinities with a mellow, browned, woody note that goes well with meats.\n  - Japanese sansho is distinctly lemony and used mainly in mixtures to mask or balance fattiness of fish and meats.\n\n#### Sandalwood \n- More commonly used in incense rather than foods. \n- The roots and heartwood of the tree *Santalum album* are the parts utilized.\n\n### Some Relatives of Pepper\nDetails on different species and types of pepper plants and their uses:\n\n1. **Long pepper (*Piper longum*)**\n   - Native of India, first pungent spice appreciated in Europe.\n   - Known historically for a more intense taste due to higher piperine content.\n   - Used in European cooking and some North African spice mixtures.\n   - Other names: pippali (Sanskrit), marichi (black pepper in Indian languages).\n\n2. **Cubeb or tailed pepper (*Piper cubeba*)**\n   - From Indonesia, traditionally used in European cuisine of the 17th century.\n   - Recognized for individual berries with tail-like stems and a pungent, fresh, eucalyptus flavor.\n\n3. **Ashanti pepper (*Piper guineense*)**\n   - From West Africa, known for nutmeg and saffron-like flavor notes.\n   - Used in various dishes.\n\n4. **Betel leaf (*P. betle*)**\n   - Clove-scented leaves used in traditional packages wrapped around ingredients like lime, areca palm, and sometimes tobacco, popular in various parts of Asia."

    "contenu": "### Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n#### Chapter 5: The Growing Environment\n\n**What a Vine Needs**  \nWine-producing regions of the world have distinct annual growth cycles for vines. During winter, vines are dormant with no green parts visible. Spring initiates budburst marking the start of the growing season. As spring progresses into summer, flowering starts and small grapes form, known as the fruit set. These are still hard and green with high acidity and no sugar. By late summer or early autumn, the grapes ripen, becoming swollen with sugar levels rising, and acidic levels dropping which develops flavors. The first sign of ripening often includes a change in color to blue/black, pink, or golden, then they are harvested. In autumn, the growing process concludes with the vine shedding its leaves and entering a dormant state again.\n\n**Heat**: Vines need a minimum annual temperature; if it's too cold or if the vineyard doesn't have enough heat, the vine faces fundamental growth issues. Below 10°C is too cold, and excessive heat also inhibits growth. Proper heat allows vines to photosynthesize effectively, supports oxygen production, and enhances fruit set and ripening.\n\n**Factors Affecting Heat**:\n- **Latitude**: Vines grow best between the latitudes of 30° and 50° from the equator. Regions too hot or too cold may not be suitable for viticulture.\n- **Altitude**: Higher altitudes can lead to temperature drops, making some high-altitude regions like Cafayate in northern Argentina suitable for viticulture despite proximity to the Equator.\n- **Ocean currents**: Large ocean currents like the Humboldt Current or the Benguela Current off South Africa impact local climates by warming or cooling, affecting vine growing suitability due to localized climate effects.\n\n**Caption**: A vineyard in Priorat, Spain. The stony soil reflects heat, benefiting the vineyard planted on a steep terraced slope.\n\n**Key Concepts**:\n- **Survival**: Vines depend on optimal growing conditions to survive, utilizing sunlight to turn CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen. Factors like climate variations, the availability of water and nutrients, and direct sunlight exposure impact the quality and quantity of the grapes produced.\n\nThis chapter covers how various natural and environmental factors integrate to form the foundational conditions necessary for vine growth and grape production in specific wine regions around the world."
