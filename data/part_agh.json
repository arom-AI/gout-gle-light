According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the most important cereal grains, in order of quantities grown and consumed globally (by both humans and our farm animals), are: corn (maize), wheat, rice, barley, sorghum, millet, oats, and rye. The most important starchy tubers are potatoes, cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, and taro.^[1]\n\nThe emergence of grain agriculture gave rise to the earliest empires. The stability and storability of dry grains made possible unprecedented potential for accumulating wealth and building political power. “The emergence of complex societies, the need to keep written records, and the popularity of beer all followed from the surplus of grain,” writes Tom Standage in *A History of the World in 6 Glasses*.^[2] Grains continue to be of great economic, social, and political importance. Failures of grain crops have toppled governments and sparked revolutions.\n\nThe same dense, dry quality that makes grains so stable for storage also makes them difficult to digest. To nourish us well, they often also need to be fermented."

Here is a structured summary:\n\n### Foams and Emulsions\n- **Concept**: The cell-wall carbohydrates in purees and juices can stabilize foams and emulsions, enhancing flavor and texture.\n- **Method**: Using modern electrical devices, foams can be made by whipping air into purees or juices. Oil can be whisked into these liquids to create emulsions.\n- **Properties**: The density of the foam or emulsion depends on the interaction between the carbohydrates and oil, and how they handle the separation of water.\n\n### Frozen Purees and Juices: Ices, Sorbets, Sherbets\n- **Types**:\n  - **Ices**: Simple frozen treats with a texture that can range from rocky to creamy.\n  - **Sorbets**: Known in 17th-century Italy as sorbetto, and purely fruit-based.\n  - **Sherbets**: Similar to sorbets but include a small amount of dairy, typically having a creamier texture.\n- **Characteristics**: These frozen desserts typically have acid (to 25–35%) and sugar adjusted (often 20–35%) to balance flavor and texture.\n- **Serving**: Often enjoyed for their refreshing qualities and can include traditional ice creams and more innovative frozen juices with unexpected flavors.\n\n### Texture of Frozen Purees and Juices\n- **Ice Formation**: The texture of these iced items varies greatly depending on the size and distribution of the ice crystals formed during freezing.\n- **Ingredients Impact**: The syrup, composed of dissolved sugars and plant cells content, and the amount of solid particles (like fruit pulp or added sugars) influence the creaminess and smoothness of the texture.\n- **Consumer Experience**: The more solid ingredients present aid in smoother textures as they obstruct ice crystal formation, providing a softer mouthfeel.\n\nThis text provides technical insights into the preparation and textural considerations of various fruit and vegetable dishes, specifically focusing on the transformation when they are turned into foams, emulsions, or frozen treats."

The region fans out from eleven finger-shaped lakes, the four major ones called Seneca, Cayuga, Canandaigua, and Keuka, all Native American names. These narrow, deep lakes (some deeper than the sea floor) were considered by the Iroquois to be formed by the hand of the Great Spirit. Many wineries are within sight of the lakes, which are considered some of the most beautiful in New York State.\n\nOriginally planted with Labrusca varieties and American crosses to make sweet wines, the vineyards of the Finger Lakes were where the state’s French-American hybrids and vinifera varieties got their start. Today, the region is abuzz with familiar activity. All types of modern varieties are made here, from tasty chardonnays to sheer rieslings to lightly spicy gewürztraminers. Not to be missed are the region’s excellent late-harvest and icewines, some based on hybrids.\n\n### THE GRAPES OF (WELCH’S) WRATH\n\nNew York produces more grape juice than any other state. That rich, purply, aromatic juice includes the famous brand Welch’s Concord grape juice, invented by Dr. Thomas Welch in 1869. Like most other grape juices, Welch’s is made from native Concord grapes grown along the banks of Lake Erie, a huge viticultural region spanning not only New York but also parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Were it not for Dr. Welch, an ardent Prohibitionist, the Lake Erie region might have developed as an important producer of wine grapes rather than grape juices.\n\nAmong the Finger Lakes’ most famous historic wineries are Dr. Konstantin Frank Vinifera Wine Cellars, Hermann J. Wiemer, Wagner Vineyards, and the off-the-wall, highly idiosyncratic Bully Hill Vineyards. The Finger Lakes region is also home to a number of newer, exciting wineries, including Standing Stone Vineyards, Ravines, Knapp Winery, Fox Run, and Sheldrake Point."

Most are harvested from the ocean floor, and depending on the species, are harvested using different methods and during different seasons.\n   - **Anatomy and Defense**:\n     - Scallops primarily defend themselves by clapping their shells together, which forces water out through a central striated muscle.\n   - **Nutritional Information**:\n     - The large adductor muscle of scallops contains significant amounts of protein and energy storage, derived from amino acids glycine and glycogen. The sweet taste largely comes from glycogen.\n   - **Harvesting and Quality**:\n     - The quality of scallop meat deteriorates long before it reaches the market. Special methods such as dipping in polyphosphates are used to preserve appearance and texture.\n\n2. **Squid, Cuttlefish, Octopus**\n   - **Description**:\n     - These cephalopods are advanced within the mollusc category, turning their muscular body walls into shell structures over time.\n   - **Anatomy**:\n     - For example, in octopuses and related species, the foot muscle (used for mobility) is located near the head, and they have multiple arms and tentacles for movement and catching prey.\n   - **Species Mentioned**:\n     - Includes _Octopus_, _Cistopus_ for octopuses; _Sepia_ for coastal-bottom cuttlefish; _Loligo_, _Todarodes_, _Ilex_ for different types of squid.\n   - **Additional Details**:\n     - A section is devoted to describing the anatomy of the squid mantle, which consists of muscle that helps in movement by contracting and squeezing water through an opening.\n\n### Illustration\n- The image includes an illustration of a squid mantle, labeled as such, and detailed description of its functionality involving muscle fibers and movement.\n\nThis format not only summarizes the text but also organizes the information into clear, digestible sections, helping in understanding the different aspects of shellfish discussed in the document."

Notably, the word 'chauvinism' originates from the French context. \n   - It’s highlighted that even today, it is common for people from one region like Burgundy to have never tried wines from another, like Bordeaux.\n\n2. **France's Vineyard Coverage:**\n   - France houses approximately 204 different varieties of grapes across 809,000 hectares, making it one of the most prodigious wine-producing nations.\n\n3. **Geographic and Climatic Divisions:**\n   - **Northern France (Champagne and Burgundy):** Characterized by its continental climate with severe winters and cool, often rainy autumns which impact grape ripeness.\n   - **Southern France:** Features a Mediterranean climate, favorable for achieving full ripeness in grapes, resulting in fleshier and sunnier wines.\n   - **Western France (Bordeaux and Loire):** Possesses a maritime climate influenced by the Gulf Stream, mitigating harsh environmental conditions but challenged by humidity and rain. The region’s moist conditions are advantageous for producing Sauternes, a sweet wine.\n\n**Quote:**\n\"La vie est trop courte pour boire du mauvais vin.\" (\"Life is too short to drink bad wine.\") This statement, attributed as first asserted by the French, underscores their discerning taste in wines and is a common piece of wisdom in the country.\n\n---"

I have made a few good batches, using methods described here. But more often, after a few days of incubation, other molds have started developing, especially sweet-smelling yellow Aspergillus molds, which I have grown a lot in the same incubation space. Pure cultures are a challenge for a multicultural generalist.\n- Sporulation, the reproductive phase of mold growth, occurs after mycelial growth. In tempeh, sporulation is marked by darkening color. As discussed, the dark patches that often develop on tempeh near airholes are signs of first sporulation. Higher oxygenation and temperature are incentives.\"\n\n**Key Points Extracted:**\n1. **Challenges in Propagating Tempeh Starter:**\n   - Limited success in consistent production.\n   - Contamination from other mold species, especially Aspergillus.\n   - Difficulty in maintaining pure cultures in a multicultural incubation environment.\n\n2. **Mold Growth and Sporulation:**\n   - Mycelial growth is followed by sporulation, indicated by darkening of the tempeh.\n   - Sporulation occurs near airholes, indicating the significance of environmental factors like oxygenation and temperature."

Decide your priority:** \n   - **Important Consideration:** If it’s wine, choose the wine first either from your cellar or local wine shop, then decide on the menu.\n   - **Focus:** A specific cuisine or ingredient you want to highlight will influence your wine selection. Consider how the wine will complement your overall menu.\n\n**2. Ensure wines are in optimum condition:**\n   - **Aging Wine:** For older red wines, stand it up a day before to let the sediment settle before decanting. Allow twenty to forty-five minutes before serving to open it and let it breathe.\n   - **Serving Temperature:** For white wines or bubblies, ensure they are chilled but not cold, and let them warm slightly out of the refrigerator to enhance flavor nuances.\n\n**3. Select quality ingredients:**\n   - **Shopping Strategy:** Buy seasonally and choose the best quality. Base shopping on what’s fresh, usually beginning with fruits and vegetables.\n   - **Visiting Markets:** Visit a butcher or fishmonger after selecting produce, deciding what role the produce will play in the meal.\n\n**4. Emphasize simplicity in ingredients:**\n   - **Culinary Approach:** Let a few stellar seasonal ingredients lead the meal without complicating the tastes too much.\n\n**5. Have a good selection of breads and cheeses:**\n   - **Pairing Tip:** Breads and cheeses can act as a culinary 'spackle', filling any gaps in flavor and texture throughout the meal.\n\n**6. Prepare much in advance:**\n   - **Preparation Tip:** Spend evenings in the kitchen well before the meal to avoid last-minute stresses. Plan ahead to smooth the process.\n   - **Set the Table Early:** Arrange the table early and provide small, appetizing foods to keep guests engaged and satisfied until the main meal.\n\n**7. Enjoy the experience above all:**\n   - **Key Reminder:** The focus should always be on enjoying the time with friends and family, with the pairing of wine and food being secondary.\n\nThe page concludes by emphasizing the pleasurable social aspect of wine and food pairing, reinforcing that the enjoyment of company should take precedence over the details of the pairing itself."

This selection of wines, mainly the fortified muscats and topaques from Rutherglen in northeast Victoria, stands out due to its rich and vibrant flavors.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n- **Definition**: 'Stickies' is the informal term used for Australia’s sweet fortified muscats and topaques.\n  \n- **Geography**: The most renowned stickies originate from Rutherglen, Victoria.\n  \n- **History**: These wines were formerly known as \"tokays,\" but the name was changed to topaques following an agreement with the European Union and Hungary, respecting the Tokay appellation from Hungary.\n  \n- **Description**: Muscats and topaques have a distinctive, near-black color and release complex colors like orange and green when poured. Tasting them is described as a mind-blowing and lengthy experience.\n  \n- **Production Process**:\n  - **Grapes Used**: Muscats are made from a brown-tinted muscat blanc à petits grains; topaques are made from white muscadelle grapes.\n  - **Method**: The grapes remain on the vine until post-normal harvest, becoming extremely concentrated in sugar. The crushed grapes are then fortified with neutral spirits and undergo fermentation, followed by aging in used oak barrels for up to twenty years.\n  - **Aging**: Follows a Sherry solera-like system to intensify the complexity and depth of flavors.\n  \n- **Flavor Profile**: The resulting wine features deep, intense flavors described as reminiscent of toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, fig syrup, miso, molasses, and honey.\n  \n- **Notable Producers**: Chambers Rosewood Vineyards, Campbells Wines, and Morris are highlighted for producing some of the best stickies.\n\nThis synoptic overview captures the essence of Australian stickies and outlines the critical elements making them unique in the world of wines. Such wines are celebrated for their rich history, complex production processes, and their mesmerizing and long-lasting flavors."

I’d lived nearby for years and had heard whispers of a new, ambitious cocktail bar opening up in the neighborhood. I opened the ominous-looking door on a chilly January evening and found a stool near the end of the bar. From my perch I recognized Phil Ward, who had served me on many illuminating occasions at the Pegu Club, which at that time offered one of the most progressive cocktail programs in New York. Phil’s presence alone gave this fledgling bar an instant aura of serious cred. I’d just begun my own self-education in cocktails and asked Phil to make me his favorite drink on the inaugural menu. (Little did I know then that bartenders hate this request.) He made me an Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, and my first sip of that electrifying drink told me that Death & Co was going to be a big player in the new cocktail craze.\n\nAs I started writing more about cocktails, Death & Co became my most reliable fountain of knowledge. Any time I needed to know what was happening next in drink trends, I paid a visit to Sixth Street to see what those innovative bartenders were up to—and figure out what other bars across the country would be serving next. Over the years, Death & Co introduced me to many firsts: my first punch service, my first swizzle, my first proper tiki drink, my first tastes of countless spirits, bitters, and other exotic ingredients, and so on. I never planned on writing a cocktail book, but at some point a few years ago, I decided that if I did, I would want it to be about this bar that has taught me so much.\n\nSo it was with great kismet that Dave and his agent, Jonah Strauss, approached me about writing this book. We quickly realized that we shared a vision for a different kind of cocktail book—one that could teach both professionals and home bartenders the hows and whys of making great drinks. Jonah, thank you for putting us all together and for selling our stubborn proposal to Ten Speed Press. Aaron Wehner, thank you for believing in us enough to add this book to Ten Speed’s ever-impressive legacy.\n\nTo my agent, advocate, and sounding board, David Larabell, you were right: this book was a beast. Is it too late to renegotiate?\nDave Kaplan, thank you for dragging me from coast to coast (and points in between) as we cobbled this thing together. Without your innate knack for hospitality and refusal to let Goliath win, 433 East Sixth Street would be some shitty Indian restaurant today. Your contagious enthusiasm for your bar, its staff, and this project has never wavered and keeps us all striving to reinvent the wheel.\nLet’s do it again sometime.\n\nAlex Day, before you took me under your tiny wing, everything I knew about"

Here's the summarized version of the structured content:\n\n### PROCEDURE\n\n1. **Infusion of Tea into Vodka:**\n   - Place tea in vodka inside a closed container.\n   - Shake and let it sit for 20-40 minutes, depending on the tea's strength and type.\n   - Strain out the dark tea from the vodka.\n\n2. **Mixing with Milk:**\n   - Pour milk into a container and add the tea-infused vodka.\n   - Stir until mixed. If the mixture curdles due to the reaction with residuals in the tea, let it rest, then stir again gently. This avoids fully breaking the curds to keep the filtration easier later.\n\n3. **Acid Addition:**\n   - If available, use citric acid. If not, slowly add lemon juice to help further curdle the milk solids.\n   - Do not mix too vigorously to prevent complete emulsification.\n\n4. **Curd Processing:**\n   - Allow to form small curds and then gently stir to increase clarity by mopping up unclumped casein.\n   - After a few rounds of gentle stirring, let the mixture settle for hours.\n\n5. **Filtration:**\n   - Strain the clearer vodka from the settled solids using a fine filter or a coffee filter, or use a centrifuge for faster results.\n\nThe document provides a clear method to create a clarified, tea-infused vodka drink, illustrating specific steps including mixture handling, acid use, and the final filtration for purity."

When I drink, I feel a welcome lightness, at least fleetingly. Alcohol can make worries and inhibitions disappear, and embolden us to speak freely; it is a social lubricant and sexual catalyst. Alcohol is also a holy sacrament, both in indigenous traditions around the world and in some of the major world religions. As Patrick McGovern observes, “Wherever we look in the ancient or modern world, we see that the principal way to communicate with the gods or the ancestors involves an alcoholic beverage, whether it is the wine of the Eucharist, the beer presented to the Sumerian goddess Ninkasi, the mead of the Vikings, or the elixir of an Amazonian or African tribe.”[^1]\n\nIn moderation, drinking has been shown to promote health and lengthen life span.[^2] In many human cultures, the B-vitamin synthesis that occurs in alcoholic beverages during fermentation has been nutritionally significant; when puritanical colonial governments outlawed certain indigenous fermented beverages, some native cultures experienced nutritional deficiency diseases for the first time as a direct result.[^3] In excess, however, alcohol can lead to nausea, vomiting, passing out, debilitating illnesses, and death.\n\n[^1]: Reference to observation made by Patrick McGovern\n[^2]: Reference to studies showing health benefits of moderate drinking\n[^3]: Reference to the impact of colonial laws on native cultures"

The famous Port firms were, for the most part, begun by men with such properly British names as Sandeman, Croft, Graham, Cockburn, Dow, and Warre. British men, in fact, were not only Port’s founders but also its most ardent, if exclusionist, advocates. In fact, until recently Port might have been described as a rather sexist beverage. The quintessential man’s drink, it was historically brought out (with great celebration and obligatory cigars) only after the women had left the room. Needless to say, women don’t leave the room anymore (in fact, in some countries, including the United Kingdom, most Port today is purchased by women).\n\nAlthough the ancient Romans prized the juicy red wines from the steep banks of the Douro River, in northeastern Portugal, centuries passed before the ingenious British transformed these wines from simple, tasty quaffs into Port, Britain’s early version of central heating. There is a fable about Port’s birth, even though in reality the wine’s “invention” was more like a series of discoveries than a single creative act. As the apocryphal story goes, two young English wine merchants were traveling through Portugal in the late 1670s, looking for wines that would be saleable in the British market. (At the time, escalating political rivalry between Britain and France meant that, in Britain, French wines were increasingly met with great disfavor.) The two merchants supposedly found themselves at a monastery outside the town of Lamego, near the Douro River. The abbot there served them a wine that was smoother, sweeter, and more interesting than any they’d tasted. When pressed to explain, the abbot confided that he’d added brandy to the wine as it had fermented.\n\nThe name Port is derived from the city of Oporto, a major port on the Atlantic at the mouth of the Douro River—the golden river. Oporto is the second largest city in Portugal, after Lisbon."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the concept of \"FUTURES\" in the context of the Bordeaux wine market, specifically focusing on the St-Émilion classification and the buying and selling of wine futures.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Definition of Wine Futures**:\n   - Wine futures refer to a sales scheme where Bordeaux wines are sold during the spring following the harvest, potentially before they are available to the general consumer. This system allows châteaux to generate cash flow immediately after the harvest by selling wines that won't be released for some time. It's a speculative practice, allowing buyers potentially to secure wines at better prices earlier on.\n\n2. **St-Émilion Classification**:\n   - First established in 1954, the St-Émilion classification is reviewed and potentially revised every ten years, unlike the Médoc or Graves classifications which are static.\n   - Wines under this classification are categorized into several tiers:\n     - Premier Grand Cru Classé\n     - First Great Classified Growth\n     - Grand Cru, Great Growth\n   - Additionally, the Premier Grand Cru Classé is split further into two divisions:\n     - \"A” group: Château Angélus, Château Ausone, Château Pavie, and Château Cheval Blanc.\n     - \"B\" group: All other Premiers Grands Crus Classés.\n   - The classification has experienced numerous legal battles and revisions, particularly due to the contentious nature of rankings and demotions.\n\n3. **Market Dynamics**:\n   - The document explains the traditional system in Bordeaux where châteaux discourage the practice of selling futures directly to consumers but rather prefer engaging through intermediaries such as negociants and retailers.\n\n4. **Historical Context**:\n   - Comparison is made with the more static classifications like those of Médoc or Graves. Additionally, it mentions the Bordeaux châteaux classified in 1855 with a reference to an appendix for more details.\n\n5. **Image Content**:\n   - The document includes an image depicting Château Pavie labeled as \"1er GRAND CRU CLASSÉ\" from the year 2008, underlining its prestigious classification status.\n\nThis information is essential for understanding the commercial and legal intricacies of Bordeaux wines as well as the speculative investment practices through wine futures. The structured approach to wine classifications in St-Émilion can be seen as both a tradition and a dynamic system reflective of ongoing market and legal shifts."

The author elaborates on the importance of understanding the chemical and physical processes involved in preparing food, which not only enhances the cooking experience but also helps in dealing efficiently with unexpected situations in the kitchen.\n\nBelow is the structured content transcribed from the image:\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\"To understand what’s happening within a food as we cook it, we need to be familiar with the world of invisibly small molecules and their reactions with each other. That idea may seem daunting. There are hundreds-plus chemical elements, many more combinations of those elements into molecules, and several different forces that rule their behavior. But scientists always simplify reality in order to understand it, and we can do the same. Foods are mostly built out of just four kinds of molecules—water, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. And their behavior can be pretty well described with a few simple principles. If you know that heat is a manifestation of the movements of molecules, and that sufficiently energetic collisions disrupt the structures of molecules and eventually break them apart, then you’re very close to understanding why heat solidifies eggs and makes foods tastier.\n\nMost readers today have at least a vague idea of proteins and fats, molecules and energy, and a vague idea is enough to follow most of the explanations in the first 13 chapters, which cover common foods and ways of preparing them. Chapters 14 and 15 then describe in some detail the molecules and basic chemical processes involved in all cooking; and the Appendix gives a brief refresher course in the basic vocabulary of science. You can refer to these final sections occasionally, to clarify the meaning of pH or protein coagulation as you’re reading about cheese or meat or bread, or else read through them on their own to get a general introduction to the science of cooking.\n\nFinally, a request. In this book I’ve sifted through and synthesized a great deal of information, and have tried hard to double-check both facts and my interpretations of them. I’m greatly indebted to the many scientists, historians, linguists, culinary professionals, and food lovers on whose learning I’ve been able to draw. I will also appreciate the help of readers who notice errors that I’ve made and missed, and who let me know so that I can correct them. My thanks in advance.\n\nAs I finish this revision and think about the endless work of correcting and perfecting, my mind returns to the first École workshop and a saying shared by Jean-Pierre Philippe, a chef from Les Menuls, near Versailles. The subject of the moment was egg foams. Chef Philippe told us that he had thought he knew everything there was to know about meringues, until one day a phone call distracted him and he left his mixer running for half an hour. Thanks to the excellent result and to other surprises throughout his career, he said, Je sais, je sais que je sais jamais: “I know, I know that I never know.” Food is an infinitely rich subject, and there’s always something about it to understand better, something new to discover, a fresh source of interest, ideas, and delight.\"\n\n---"
