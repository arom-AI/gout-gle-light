Here's a structured summary of the key points:\n\nTitle:\n**FIND USEFUL, MEANINGFUL WORDS TO DESCRIBE EACH SPIRIT**\n\nContent:\n- The document highlights the importance of avoiding esoteric descriptors like \"supple\" or vague phrases such as \"a hint of stone fruit.\" Instead, more relatable and conversational feedback is encouraged.\n- Tasting spirits is seen as a means to connect to a personal experience or articulate a memory related to the aromas or tastes experienced. For example, a peaty Scotch could remind someone of a campfire near the ocean, or a sherry rich with dried fruit and baking spice could evoke the essence of Christmas.\n- It stresses that extensive experience in tasting spirits is not necessary to be good at it. Openness to personal relevance and not being shy about sharing what senses and memories arise is encouraged.\n- Honest and spontaneous comments are valued as they can prevent a tasting session from becoming dull. Animated engagement, emotion, and active participation are preferred over a quiet, passive approach to tasting sessions.\n\nOverall:\nThe document promotes a lively, emotionally engaging, and memory-evoking approach to the tasting and description of spirits to enhance the experience."

    "contenu": "The document provided on the slide titled \"4.2 Le stockage et la conservation\" discusses various materials and methods used for the storage and preservation of wine. Here’s an analysis of its structured content:\n\n### 4.2 Storage and Preservation (Le stockage et la conservation)\n- **Ideal Wine Cellar (La cave idéale)**:\n  - Types of wine storage shelves:\n    - Anti-vibration shelves\n    - Shelves with natural air\n    - Polyethylene containers\n    - Armoire à vins\n    - Caves en kit\n\n### Storage Materials (Le matériel de stockage)\nThere are different types of racks and shelving made from wood or concrete specifically designed for bottle storage.\n\n1. **Metal Racks (Les casiers métalliques)**:\n   - Mounted by attaching to full and other types of panels.\n   - Primarily used for upright storage (e.g., aperitif, water-of-life, fruit juices), but instability is a major drawback for storage of bottles in a lying down position.\n\n2. **Reinforced Cement Storage Racks (Les casiers de stockage en ciment armé)**:\n   - **Volcanic Stone from Auvergne (Pozzolana)**: wine-colored, porous stone that regulates humidity. Excellent insulation and thermal absorption. Bottles are stacked on various capacity plates fully assembled by cement.\n   - **Murinhtite**: Possesses characteristics similar to volcanic stone, highly modular, allowing for customizable configurations.\n\n3. **Polystyrene Shelves (Les casiers en polystyrène)**:\n   - Due to isothermal and insulating properties from light and odors, they provide the possibility to store bottles in units of twelve independent modules. \n\n4. **Artisan Racks (Les casiers artisanaux)**:\n   - Made from wood or brick, tailored to the specific dimensions of the cellar or needs. Generally, a more expensive option compared to other materials.\n\n5. **Clay Racks (Les casiers nid d'abeille)**:\n   - Practical for use at the bottom of a wine cellar because they allow the storage directly on the ground. Highly modular but fragile.\n\n6. **Wine Cabinets (Les armoires à vin)**:\n   - Suitable for storing a small quantity of bottles (around 500) where there is no cellar available. These facilitate maintaining wines in good conditions inside or near the main distribution area, with temperature control across 12 to 14 different levels.\n\n7. **Kit Cellars (Les caves en kit)**:\n   - Set up as a block unit in the soil, consisting of self-supporting stairs and storage racks for around 1000 bottles, representing a medium-sized model.\n\nEach type of storage system offers unique features aimed at optimizing the conditions under which wines are stored, affecting factors such as temperature, light, vibration, and humidity."

Each pairing is listed with detailed descriptions and suggestions. Here they are reformatted for clarity and presentation:\n\n### Raisin & Anis\n- **Reference:** See \"Anis & Raisin.\"\n\n### Raisin & Avocat\n- **Description:** The California Table Grape Commission suggests that raisins can successfully complement dishes typically served with tomatoes, like mozzarella and avocado salads, especially when tomatoes are off-season.\n\n### Raisin & Cacahuète\n- **Description:** Chosen for its unique flavor for classic American peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (specifically using Concord grapes). Provides a rich, grape jelly luxury feel. Suggests making a perfumed sorbet by mixing 500 ml of unsweetened grape jelly with 250 ml of jasmine syrup, then freezing the mixture for service with peanut sorbet and cream from Picard.\n\n### Raisin & Fraise\n- **Description:** Known as \"fragola uva\" in Italy, this type of strawberry grape has a pronounced flavor and has been crossed with Isabella grapes (a native American species) to develop Concord grapes. This crossbreeding enhances candy-like flavors, often noted jointly with raspberry flavors.\n\n### Raisin & Fromage à pâte molle\n- **Reference:** See \"Fromage à pâte molle & Raisin.\"\n\n### Raisin & Fromage bleu\n- **Description:** Pairs well with blue cheese, creating fruity and spicy contrasts that enhance the dining experience. Ideal for pairing with hearty salads or cheese platters.\n\n### Raisin & Melon\n- **Reference:** See \"Melon & Raisin.\"\n\n### Raisin & Noix\n- **Description:** Jeremy Round notes the excellent pairing of muscat grapes with fresh, creamy nuts for autumn. \"Italia\" variety of grapes is recommended, commonly used for winemaking.\n\n### Raisin & Pêche\n- **Reference:** See \"Pêche & Raisin.\"\n\n### Raisin & Poisson blanc\n- **Reference:** See \"Poisson blanc & Raisin.\"\n\n### Raisin & Porc\n- **Description:** Pellegrino Artusi suggests pairing sausages with sweet and slightly tart grapes. Recommends sautéing Italian sausages with grapes and finishing with a sprinkle of spices and anise until sausages are well-crushed.\n\n### Raisin & Poulet\n- **Description:** Raisins are considered an excellent addition to white meats like chicken or quail, enhancing flavors gently, with historic recipes suggesting the use of vine leaves and raisins in cooking poultry dishes.\n\nThis document serves as a culinary guide to explore various traditional and innovative ways to integrate raisins into different meals and to enhance specific flavors."

Key points in the document include:\n\n1. **International Variety in Crocks:** In the United States, as well as in Asia, people use crocks for fermentation, often with varying shapes. In Asia, these crocks typically have a potbelly shape, and the Korean version is named \"onggi\".\n\n2. **Personal Examples:** Amy Potter, a resident of Dowelltown, Tennessee, is mentioned as creating unique crock designs with functional and aesthetic values, including a heavy interior lid and an outer lid.\n\n3. **Encouragement for Creativity:** The text encourages readers to utilize and improvise with various vessels for fermentation, not limited to conventional crocks. It suggests looking in thrift stores for items like canisters, jars, bowls, and vases that could serve as alternative fermentation vessels.\n\n4. **Mention of a Specific Crock Design:** The water-locked moat style crock, often imported from Germany and also available from Poland or China, is described. This design uses a water-filled moat at the mouth and a fitted top to prevent air from entering while allowing the release of internal pressure. The German Harsch brand is specifically cited as offering this design.\n\n5. **Tailored Advice for Fermenters:** The document advises readers not to be restrained by lack of specialized equipment and to collaborate with artisans such as potters, or to repurpose existing containers to suit their fermentation needs.\n\nThis document's overarching theme is the promotion of creative and adapted approaches to fermentation, illustrating the cultural richness and individual creativity in this field."

It is divided into four main sections, each describing different methods:\n\n1. **Incorporating Starch Into Sauces**\n   - Describes how directly adding flour or starch to a hot sauce can result in lumps because the granules gelate and prevent even dispersion.\n\n2. **Slurries, Beurre Manié, Floured Meat**\n   - Discusses three methods for incorporating starch into sauces:\n     - **Slurries**: Mixing starch with cold water before adding to the sauce to prevent lumps.\n     - **Beurre Manié**: Mixing flour with butter to form a paste, then adding it to the sauce for last-minute thickening.\n     - **Floured Meat**: Coating pieces of meat with flour before sautéing and then adding a liquid, letting the starch disperse and adding thickness as the sauce cooks.\n\n3. **Roux**\n   - Describes roux as a traditional method where flour is cooked with fat (like butter) to form a paste, which is then used to thicken sauces. The document discusses the proper preparation of roux, emphasizing the importance of precooking the flour to eliminate raw flavor and improve texture.\n\n4. **Improvements in Flavor, Color, and Dispersibility**\n   - Elaborates on the benefits of properly preparing roux and starch mixtures beyond mere thickening, such as enhancing flavor, color, and texture. It also explains how starch modification (like dextrinization) affects sauce properties, making them less likely to congeal when cooling.\n\nThe text provides a comprehensive guide on using starch-based methods for sauce preparation, focusing on techniques that yield the best results in terms of consistency, taste, and appearance."

Unlike most Spanish wines that are named after geographical regions, Albariño wine is named after the grape variety.\n  \n- **Character and Usage:** Albariño is described as a racily refreshing wine, considered one of the best matches in the world for seafood. It is recommended to be drunk young.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Insights\n\n- **Origin & Migration:** Albariño originated in northeastern Portugal and eventually moved over the border to Galicia, Spain. This grape is also grown in Portugal, known as vinho verde.\n\n- **Historical Theories:** One folklore tale suggests that Albariño was brought from the Rhine in Germany to Spain by Cistercian monks during their pilgrimage to the tomb of the apostle James in Santiago de Compostela, Spain during the twelfth century.\n\n- **Cultural Heritage:** Galicia's heritage includes a rich Celtic influence evident in its traditional music, notably the use of a gaita, an instrument similar to a Scottish bagpipe.\n\n### Local Wine Production Insights\n\n- **Wine Quality and Local Perception:** Albariño and its cousin grape varieties have been grown in Galicia for centuries. Historically, the wines produced from these grapes were simple and inexpensive, reflecting the modest economic conditions and needs of local fishermen.\n\n- **Commercial Development:** Traditionally, there was little commercial motivation to improve the wine quality, as the primary goal was local consumption without much focus on broader market appeal.\n\n--- \n\nThis document provides a blend of viticulture, historical context, and cultural insights, primarily centered on the Albariño grape and its significance in the Rías Baixas region of Spain."

    "contenu": "# THE FOODS OF BURGUNDY\n\nIf any one dish epitomizes the intimate connection of wine and food in Burgundy, it is coq au vin (hen or rooster cooked in Burgundy wine). Rustic, hearty, and slow cooked, it is a soulful, humble fare that speaks of the earth, not of artifice. Burgundian cooking may not be cutting edge or elaborate, but it is honest and true to centuries of good home cooks who knew how to take snails, rabbits, and guinea hens and make them irresistible.\n\nBurgundy’s most famous vineyards are bracketed by two of the legendary food capitals of France—Dijon and Lyon. Dijon calls itself the mustard capital of the world, and mustard, simple as it is, is France’s best-loved condiment. You can find a little pot on every table of virtually every bistro in the country. About 70 percent of France’s mustard is moutarde de Dijon, which refers to the style—a creamy, smooth, especially pungent mustard—originally developed in Dijon. Today, many Burgundian villages have their own moutarderie, or mustard shop, where artisanal mustards are made, sometimes with slightly fermented white grape juice rather than vinegar.\n\nAlthough snails are cooked and eaten all over France, no snail preparation is better known than escargots à la bourguignonne, snails cooked Burgundy style. Today, canned and frozen snails from Turkey and Algeria show up in many restaurants worldwide, but in Burgundy, wild snails can still be collected in the vineyards. Traditionally, these are stuffed with garlic butter, cooked, and served piping hot.\n\nThe beef dishes of Burgundy are also much acclaimed, especially the slowly braised beef stew known as boeuf bourguignon. But the most exciting beef of all is Charolais, named for the town of Charoles in southwestern Burgundy, and one of Europe’s finest breeds. These massive cattle have meat that is tender and succulent, with an incomparable full, rich flavor. A hunk of roasted Charolais and a glass of Pommard or Volnay is Burgundy gift-wrapped. With Charolais cattle, meat is just the beginning, however. From the Charolais’s milk come cylinders of rich Charolais cheese, which are also prized.\n\nBut the most legendary Burgundian cheese of all must be the pungent, runny Époisses de Bourgogne, named after the village Époisses. Sought after all over the world, Époisses is aged slowly and given a daily washing with marc de Bourgogne, the local eau-de-vie."

    "contenu": "The document presents an analysis and discussion on the origins and characteristics of ginger beer plant (GBP) and its possible confusion with tibicos, also known as water kefir grains. Here is the structured content:\n\n1. **Reference to Historical Document**:\n   - The text begins by referencing an 1892 report in the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London* by H. Marshall Ward, who discusses the microbiology of the ginger beer plant but admits uncertainty regarding its origins.\n\n2. **Historical Note on Ginger Beer Plant**:\n   - Professor Bayley Balfour speculated that the ginger beer plant was introduced into Britain from the Crimea around 1855. This claim is based on second-hand information and remains unverified. Dr. Ransome notes another theory that it might have come from Italy in 1891, also unsubstantiated. The true origin of GBP is described as enshrouded in mystery.\n\n3. **Personal Insights and Observations**:\n   - The author initially believed that ginger beer plant (GBP) and tibicos were identical.\n   - This belief changed after the author's friend, Jay Bost, an ethnobotanist, introduced him to a source (yemoos.com) which showed distinct cultures of both GBP and tibicos.\n\n4. **Website Contribution to Understanding**:\n   - Yemoos.com, managed by Nathan and Emily Pujol, offers cultures of both tibicos and ginger beer plant. They note significant visual and behavioral differences between the two cultures despite similar fermentation conditions.\n\n5. **Detailed Observations by Nathan and Emily Pujol**:\n   - GBP generally appears rounder and more consistent in shape while tibicos grains are jagged and larger.\n   - Occasionally with tibicos, some grains are exceptionally large and triangular, a shape not observed in GBP.\n   - GBP tends to form in an almost spiral, torpedo shape, distinctively different from tibicos.\n\n6. **Concluding Realizations**:\n   - Upon receiving samples of both cultures, the author confirms their visual distinctiveness.\n   - Reflects on a previous mistake where initial water kefir grains thought to be GBP were actually tibicos, highlighting the necessity for side-by-side evaluation to appreciate their functional and structural differences. \n\nThis document highlights the challenges in identifying and classifying microbial cultures, as well as the ongoing efforts to better understand their origins and characteristics through scientific and community collaboration."

    "contenu": "# COOKING WITH HERBS AND SPICES\n\n## The Influence of Oxygen\n\n- **Preservation**: Original flavors of spices and herbs are best preserved by prechilling both spice and grinder to keep the aromatics as cool as possible, reducing exposure to oxygen which can alter aroma and flavor.\n- **Technique Impact**: Careful chopping with a sharp knife minimizes cell damage and preserves the herb structure intact to leave fresh flavor, while pounding or bruising herbs leads to rapid discoloration and flavor alteration.\n- **Aging of Spices**: Finely ground spices exposed to oxygen can mellow over the course of several days or weeks.\n\n## The Influence of Other Ingredients\n\n- **Role of Fats and Oils**: These ingredients dissolve more aroma molecules than water during cooking, allowing slower release of flavors and making them more gradually persistent during eating.\n- **Alcohol**: As it is volatile, it releases flavor relatively quickly, improving the extraction and release of aromatics.\n- **Cooking Methods**: Techniques like steaming and smoking can use the volatility of aroma molecules effectively, with steam carrying the aromatics into the cooler surface of the food being cooked.\n\n## Marinades and Rubs\n\n- **Introduction**: Problematic absorption in solid chunks of meat due to water content of meat (75% water).\n- **Solutions**: Use of fat-soluble marinades or dry rubs to improve flavor penetration. Water and oil-based marinades enhance surface contact, while dry rubs affect solid areas with minimal moisture intrusion.\n- **Cooking Technique Adaptations**: For more efficient flavor penetration, injecting marinade into different areas of meat is suggested for distribution throughout the meat.\n\n## Herbs and Spices as Coatings\n\n- **Protective Layer**: Coating meat with herbs and spices can protect it from direct high heat, retaining moisture and leading to less overcooked outer layers.\n- **Texture and Flavor Enhancement**: Coarsely cracked spices can provide a crunchy counterpoint. If spice crusts include oil, it helps in frying the coating rather than letting it dry out.\n\n## Extracts: Flavored Oils, Vinegars, Alcohols\n\n- **Concentration of Flavors**: This section deals with the use of extracts like flavored oils, vinegars, and alcohols which can instantly provide strong flavors to dishes.\n- **Ingredients for Extraction**: Commonly used materials are oils, vinegars, and sugars which capture and convey intense flavors efficiently when used correctly. \n\nEach section provides insights into specific techniques and the principles behind effectively using herbs and spices in cooking, emphasizing the proper handling and inclusion of other ingredients to maximize flavor retention and enhance the cooking process."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects of bread making, particularly focusing on the processes involved before and during baking, as well as the type of ovens used. Here’s a breakdown of the structured content extracted from the document under specific headings:\n\n### Dough Preparation\n- **High-protein Flours**: Describes the process of giving dough made from high-protein flours a second rising to develop tougher gluten fully. The dough is divided, rested, and then prepared for a final dramatic rise during baking.\n\n### Retarding the Fermentation\n- **Purpose and Benefits**: Retarding the dough in a cold chamber slows yeast activity, extends the fermentation process, and modifies the texture of the dough. This method gives bakers more flexibility, allows for more flavor development, and results in a more open, irregular crumb structure. It was noted that yeasts take 10 times longer to raise bread in refrigeration than at warm room temperature.\n- **Historical Context**: In the 1920s, bakers in Vienna began breaking the work into two distinct periods (daytime work and overnight baking) to optimize freshness for morning sales.\n\n### Traditional Bread Ovens\n- **Historical Use and Design**: Describes traditional bread ovens used until the mid-19th century, which were large stone or brick structures heated by wood fires, capable of storing heat from the roofs to facilitate slow, even baking.\n- **Functional Insights**: These ovens facilitated more efficient heat utilization and improved the quality of the bread through slow, gradual heat transfer and a final rapid initial heating, which was important for the dough’s rise and texture enhancement.\n\n### Modern Metal Ovens\n- **Design and Operation**: Modern metal ovens are easier to bake in than traditional wood-fired ovens but have limitations, such as less ideal heat distribution and retention, and the inability to maintain temperature through consistent heat sources like gas flames or electric elements.\n- **Challenges**: During baking, temperature can rise above target levels, potentially leading to scorched bread if combustion gases from the heat sources aren't managed properly.\n- **Advantages of Traditional Elements in Modern Settings**: Incorporating traditional baking techniques, such as using ceramic baking stones or ceramic oven inserts in modern ovens, can replicate some advantages of old-style ovens by preheating them to the oven’s maximum temperature.\n\n### Baking Techniques\n- **Impact of Oven Type on Bread Quality**: The type of oven and its characteristics like temperature control and ability to generate steam significantly impact the crust and crumb of the bread, as well as its overall sensory qualities.\n\nThis structured content summarizes the key points related to bread-making techniques and oven types as discussed in the document."

Overwhipped cream results in butter grains and a greasy residue in the mouth.\n\n### The Importance of Cold\n- Whipping cream benefits from starting cold (40–50°F/5–10°C) and should be aged in the refrigerator for 12 hours or more before whipping. Warmth or insufficient chilling results in crystals and liquid fat, which makes whipped cream granular and watery.\n\n### How Different Creams Behave When Whipped\n- For ideal whipping, 30% fat content in cream is necessary, which allows for the formation of a continuous skeleton of fat globules.\n\n#### Types of cream\n- Light cream with 38 to 40% fat whips faster but forms a stiffer and less voluminous foam, suitable for pastries and baking.\n- For decorative purposes, heavy cream is usually diluted with a quarter of its volume of milk to make a 30% cream, resulting in a softer foam.\n\n#### Role of fat globules\n- In homogenized cream, fat globules are covered with proteins and are more resistant to over-whipping. Adding lemon juice (1 teaspoon per 20 ml of cream) can slightly acidify the cream, making protein in its globule membranes easier to manipulate.\n\n### Methods\n- **Hand Whipping**: Involves physical exertion.\n- **Machine Whipping**: Uses an electric beater to incorporate more air and produces a greater volume.\n- **Pressurized Gas**: Utilizes nitrous oxide (N₂O), leading to the fluffiest whipped cream.\n\n### Early Whipped Cream Recipe: *My Lord of S. Alban's Creme Founette*\n- Historical recipe involving thick cream, whipped using a bundle of white hard rushes, and requiring considerable time and sugar for preparation.\n\n    **Quote**: *Sir Kenelm Digby, The Closet Opened, 1669*\n\n---"

Here is the transcription and structured analysis of the content:\n\n### Document Content\n\n---\n\n#### Understanding Brine Concentration in Vegetable Fermentation\nThe document mentions that a 5% brine concentration is beneficial once vegetables are submerged because they absorb salt and release juices, which dilutes the salt concentration by more than half.\n\n---\n\n#### Specific Example: Brined Okra Recipe\n**Author:** Lorna Moravec, West Texas\n\n**Description:** \nLorna describes her successful experience fermenting okra in brine during a hot Texas summer. The okra used was not ideal for traditional uses such as frying or making gumbo but turned out excellent when fermented. The process involved placing woody, tough okra pods into mason jars, holding them down with the shoulders of the jars, adding garlic cloves and jalapeños, and then pouring in the brine.\n\n**Outcome:** \nThe brined okra was consumed quickly due to its delicious taste.\n\n---\n\n#### Scientific Perspective on Salt Stock and Brine Solutions\nThe text references a 1940 study by the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. The study compared highly salty \"salt-stock\" brining (which saturates vegetables with salt to prevent microbial and enzymatic transformations and requires a desalination soak before consumption) to a 5% brine solution. It was found that lower initial salt concentrations (such as 5%) promote quicker development of acids and lower brine pH, though it may result in lower total quantities of acids produced compared to higher initial salt concentrations.\n\n---\n\n#### Additional Uses of Brine\nThe final notes suggest using excess brine from vegetable fermentation as a digestive tonic or as a starter for seed cheeses, pâtés, and milks, which further emphasizes the versatility and benefits of brine in culinary and health practices.\n\n---"

Below is the structured content based on the information provided in the document:\n\n### Impact of Temperature on Wine\n\n1. **Flavor Sensitivity to Temperature:**\n   - **Cold Wine:** Ice-cold wines can taste bland and flavorless, appearing lighter and less aromatic.\n   - **Warm Wine:** Warmer wines may seem stronger, sweeter, and bolder. Once temperatures exceed the mid-70s (Fahrenheit), alcohol evaporates faster, leading to an unpleasantly boozy smell.\n\n2. **Serving Temperatures for Wine:**\n   - **Delicate Wines:** Typically served cooler to preserve their subtle flavors.\n   - **Robust Wines:** Generally served warmer to enhance their bolder flavors.\n   - **Variability:** Preferences in serving temperature can vary widely among individuals. For instance, lighter reds like Beaujolais may be chilled even below more typical serving temperatures for reds.\n\n3. **Storing Wine:**\n   - **Cold Storage:** Slows down the aging process, preserving the wine longer. Typical storage temperatures are around 56°F (13°C).\n   - **Warm Storage:** Speeds up wine’s development, which might not always be desirable, as the wine can lose freshness and flavor if stored too warm or if the temperature fluctuates.\n\nThese insights are geared towards helping individuals optimize their wine experience by understanding and managing the temperature in which wines are served and stored."

    "contenu": "**The Story of Foodpairing**\n\n**Bernard Lahousse**\n\nWhy do some ingredients pair especially well together, while others do not? This is a question that has undoubtedly kept many of us in the food industry up at night.\n\nIt was my keen interest in food science and gastronomy that led me to bioengineering. In 2005 I began asking around to see if any chefs in Belgium were interested in partnering with a food scientist to expand their culinary practices. My first collaborators were Michelin-starred chefs Sang-Hoon Degeimbre of L'Air du Temps in Liernu and Kobe Desramaults of In de Wulf in Dranouter. We met regularly to brainstorm and discuss potential menu items they had in the works. It was during one of our sessions that Sang-Hoon asked, \"Bernard, why is it that when I smell kiwis, I also smell the sea? Is that possible?\"\n\nFortunately, a fellow bioengineer by the name of Jeroen Lammertyn had access to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) equipment. Together we ran an aroma analysis and found that in addition to fruity esters, kiwis also contain concentrations of green, grassy and fatty-scented aldehydes that have a marine-like scent similar to that of oysters and other types of shellfish. The aromatic link between these two seemingly unrelated ingredients formed the basis of our very first foodpairing and so the kiwi/hre was born. Degeimbre’s singular creation has since become a signature dish on the menu at L'Air du Temps.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the science of foodpairings, I wondered if anyone else had puzzled over my hypothesis that complementary ingredients share key aromas. I discovered that François Benzi, a food chemist at the Swiss fragrance and flavour company Firmenich, had made a similar discovery in 1992. I contacted him and we met several times in Geneva to discuss the notion that ingredients that pair well contain the same aroma molecules.\n\n**The kiwtire**\nThe story of Foodpairing starts with a dish created by chef Sang-Hoon Degeimbre: a raw oyster served over diced kiwi, with croutons and a lime-infused coconut cream. Kiwi and oysters share a marine-like aroma note."

It is defined by the Ahr River, which flows into the Rhine just south of Bonn, in the Mittelrhein. The rough, rocky, forested terrain is beautiful. This region is a favorite wine country getaway for residents of Bonn.\n\nAlthough counterintuitive, most of the wine made here is red. Specifically, it is pale, light spätburgunder (pinot noir)—decent enough but not usually remarkable. The top producers include Kreuzberg, J. J. Adenauer, Meyer-Näkel, and Jean Stodden."

Pouring cooled sugar syrup (mixed with butter and vanilla) over the layers and marinating overnight.\n3. Drying the mixture in a low oven along with the extra sugar syrup.\n4.

It is noted for:\n- Faster maturation than kombucha.\n- Remaining active at lower temperatures.\n- Similar fermentation process as kombucha, substituting honey for sugar.\n\nThe origin of **Jun** is not clearly documented but is thought to be a recent divergence from the kombucha family. Although some sources mention Tibet as its origin, this lacks definitive documentation. It is particularly popular in the Pacific Northwest, with specific mention of a commercial producer in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n---\n\n### Vinegar\n\nThis section discusses the relationship between the kombucha SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast) and the mother-of-vinegar found in fermenting vinegar.

    "contenu": "### THE FLAVOR OF HISTORY\n\nIf you want to taste something really old, Madeira is the answer. While finding a bottle of Bordeaux from, say, the 1960s can be daunting (not to mention fiscally dangerous), Madeiras that are a century old or more can easily be found in specialty wine shops. Indeed, vintage Madeiras that go back to the founding of the United States, in 1776, are known to exist. (For my part, I have tasted Blandy’s Madeiras back to the awesome, luscious 1811, which redefined my notion of exquisite.) What makes these centuries, especially outstanding is, of course, their spellbinding complexity and aliveness. Properly sealed, a bottle of Madeira will easily outlive its owner, and remain in excellent condition throughout its life. Importantly, because it's already been oxidized and maderized, Madeira is nearly indestructible. During colonial times (pre-refrigeration), this fact made Madeira especially appealing in the American South, where bottles could survive over decades of hot summers without any ill effects.\n\nAlthough the islands are on the same parallel as Los Angeles and Jerusalem, they get a lot of rain—more, in fact, than London. But luckily, most of it falls in winter—between October and April, when the vines are mostly dormant. Nonetheless, mold and mildew are threats, and some vineyards are planted up on high trellises so that they are lifted way above the ground and dew. A potentially more serious danger is the leste, an intense heat wave blowing off the Sahara desert, which can cover the vines in sand and dust and raise the temperature to more than 100°F (38°C) for weeks at a time."

It highlights the depth and concentration of Merlots from these regions, noting that this style of Merlot is growing stronger each year, particularly in the New World. Examples include Casa Lapostolle’s Cuvée Alexandre.\n  2. **Sleek Style Merlot**: This style is particularly noted in Northern Italy but also found in Chile and Washington State. This style is described as being one of the best, providing a riveting potential that showcases the versatility of Merlot.\n\n### Mourvèdre\n- **Origin and Characteristics**:\n  - Mourvèdre is described as having a dark, hard-edged, almost brooding flavor and is never light, juicy, or lively. The grape is Spanish by origin, primarily known by the local names monastrell in northern Spain and mataró in the Pyrenees region.\n  - It has a significant historical origin, supposedly propagated by monks next to Castilla-La Mancha, in the province of Valencia. Its Latin derivation from \"monasteriellum\" ties the variety’s history to monastic practices.\n  - The variety is utilized widely in the south-central region of Castilla-La Mancha, particularly in Jumilla, where it is used to produce muscular wines with dry, bitter, espresso-like flavors.\n\n- **Use in Wine Making**:\n  - In the Rhône region of Southern France, a small amount of mourvèdre is often used in blends such as Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Côtes-du-Rhône to add depth, color, and complexity.\n  - Before the phylloxera epidemic, mourvèdre was widely planted across the south and has been integral in shaping the regional wine profile.\n\n### General Information\n- The document framed its discussion on the varietals by acknowledging the extensive plant varieties of grapes and focused deeply on Merlot and Mourvèdre to provide insight into their styles and historical significance in wine-making."

Below is the structured content of the information provided, including a direct transcription of the table which details the composition of malt extract:\n\n### Types and Properties of Syrups:\n- **Maltodextrins**: Syrups containing less than 20% glucose plus maltose, used mainly to add viscosity and body with little sweetness and moisture absorption.\n- **High-fructose corn syrups**: Compose of around 75% fructose plus glucose, contributing to overall sweetness and helping to retain moisture in baked goods.\n- **High-maltose syrups**: Valuable in ice creams and confections, beneficial where lowered freezing points or interference with crystallization are desired, providing less sweetness than table sugar or glucose.\n\n### Malt Syrup and Extract:\n- **Origin and Usage**: Made from a combination of germinated cereal grains, mainly barley. It was a primary sweetener in ancient China and still used in various traditional and modern applications.\n- **Manufacturing Process**: Involves malting (soaking and drying grains), mashing (mixing malted grain with water and cooking), and extracting a sweet slurry to produce malt syrup.\n- **Applications**: Used in Asia to add gloss to savory dishes like Peking duck and in confections.\n\n### Table: The Composition of Malt Extract\n```markdown\n| Component                | % of Malt Extract by Weight |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Water                    | 20%                         |\n| Protein                  | 5%                          |\n| Minerals                 | 1%                          |\n| Total sugars             | 60%                         |\n| Glucose                  | 7-10%                       |\n| Maltose (double-glucose chains) | 40%                |\n| Maltotriose (triple-glucose chains) | 10-15%          |\n| Longer glucose chains    | 25-30%                      |\n```\nThis structured content captures the essential elements discussed in the document, providing clear insights into different types of syrups, especially focusing on malt syrups, and including precise compositions commonly found in malt extracts."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects of cooking and utilizing seeds, with a focus on maintaining and altering the texture of cooked beans, reducing cooking times, and briefly touches on fermented legumes in India. Here's a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Maintaining the Texture of Cooked Beans\n- **Cooking Water Content**: The content of dissolved substances in cooking water can influence beans by either reinforcing the cell walls, thus preventing softening (as with hard water rich in calcium or magnesium), or by accelerating the softening and dissolution of cell-wall hemicelluloses (with acidic or alkaline cooking water).\n- **Cooking Approach**: Contrary to some beliefs, adding salt to the soaking water helps beans absorb water more slowly but more thoroughly, resulting in a faster cooking time once they are prepared.\n\n### Reducing Cooking Times by Presoaking\n- **Presoaking Beans**: Soaking beans in water reduces the overall cooking time by around 25% or more. The rationale is that heat penetrates dried seeds more quickly than those soaked, though much of the perceived cooking time is actually due to waiting for the water to penetrate into the beans during cooking.\n\n### Briefly Fermented Legumes in India\n- **Local Fermentation Practices**: Despite a lower general popularity of fermented foods in India compared to other places, some legumes and rice preparations are slightly fermented. Examples include:\n  - **Idli**: Fermented cakes made from black gram and rice.\n  - **Dosa**: A crispy, crepe-like dish made from rice and black gram.\n  - **Papadums**: Thin wafers of black gram pasted, fermented briefly, then fried or dried.\n  \nThe document elaborates on these methods as adaptations to enhance flavor, improve texture, and modify cooking times of legume-based dishes."

Both the Adige and Po rivers, on their way to the Adriatic Sea, flow across the broad plains of the Veneto, creating large expanses of rich, sun-drenched farmland where vegetables and fruits, including grapes, grow profusely. Since great wines in general come not from fertile soil but from the opposite, the Veneto’s best vines tend to be planted near hills, on well-drained volcanic soil interspersed with sand, clay, and gravel.\n\n#### The Most Important Veneto Wines\n\n| Leading Wines      |\n|----------------------|\n| AMARONE red          |\n| PINOT GRIGIO white   |\n| PROSECCO white (sparkling)|\n| SOAVE white          |\n| VALPOLICELLA red     |\n\n#### Wines of Note\n\n| Wine Variety | Type |\n|--------------|------|\n| BARDOLINO | red |\n| BIANCO DI CUSTOZA | white |\n| CABERNET SAUVIGNON | red |\n| CHARDONNAY | white |\n| MERLOT | red |\n| RECIOTO DELLA VALPOLICELLA | red (sweet) |\n| RECIOTO DI SOAVE | white (sweet) |\n\nThe Veneto can be divided into three zones. In the far west, near Lake Garda and the volcanic mountain range of Monte Lessini, the traditional wines Soave, Valpolicella, Bardolino, and amarone are produced, as well as Bianco di Custoza, one of those simple sorts of white wines that taste best when drunk in a bar (the wine, not you) in the region where they’re made. Verona, the major city, is one of Italy’s wine capitals; each year, the country’s largest wine fair, Vinitaly, is held here. (Spread over five or more coliseum-size buildings, the fair includes so many thousands of Italian wines that tasting them all could take weeks.) In the Veneto’s northern hills above Treviso (held to be the radicchio capital of Italy), Prosecco is made. What is considered more or less the center of the Veneto, from Venice to Vicenza, is the source of several different types of wine, ranging from simple merlots, cabernet sauvignons, chardonnays, and pinot grigios of no particular distinction (Santa Margherita pinot grigio comes from here) to more exciting wines, especially from around Breganze, Colli Berici, and Colli Euganei."

Recently I began making sauerkraut. My gut problems have nearly disappeared, and I am slowly adding back the occasional wheat product (a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie were my first tests, and a pizza is coming up next!). I think my natural probiotics had been wiped out by frequent rounds of antibiotics for Lyme disease, cardiac problems requiring antibiotics before dental work, and so on.\n\nWell-being and healing are not simple phenomena attributable to any single determinative factor. Fermented foods are not _the_ secret to health and longevity. Nor is exercise, nor a curious mind, nor an open heart, nor a wholesome diet, nor inner contentment, nor sexual bliss, nor regular bowel movements, nor restful sleep. But each of these, along with innumerable other factors, influences the overall state of our well-being. And fermented foods are part of the picture.\n\nIn this chapter, I will briefly describe the major nutritional and health benefits of fermented foods and beverages, summarize findings of the peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature, and try to answer some of the questions that have come up repeatedly, in my email and public presentations. It is the purported health benefits that are drawing many people to become aware of fermented foods as such. I do not have absolute answers. Scientific understandings of the role of bacteria in mediating and regulating physiological processes in our bodies are crude and rudimentary. Even less is understood about the dynamics of ingesting live bacteria.\n```"

Here is the content broken down into markdown format for better readability:\n\n---\n\n### Concentrations will kill yeast\n- It advises filtering water, boiling it in an open vessel, or letting the water stand for a couple of days for chlorine to evaporate before use. It's important to check if your tap water contains non-volatile chloramines.\n\n### Mold developed on the surface of your ferment\n- To handle mold, gently skim the mold off the surface. If that's not feasible, siphon the liquid below the mold into another vessel, leaving the mold behind.\n- In the early stages of wild fermentation, it's crucial to stir frequently. This prevents mold as stirring disturbs the surface. Insufficient stirring often leads to mold development.\n\n### Your ferment tastes like vinegar\n- Fermented alcoholic beverages exposed to air can turn into vinegar over time due to acetic-acid-producing bacteria known as *Acetobacter*, which are present everywhere and require oxygen to grow.\n- During vigorous fermentation phases, yeasts dominate and carbon dioxide released protects against vinegar formation. However, as fermentation wanes, the risk of turning into vinegar increases, especially in open vessels.\n- To prevent this, one should consume the beverage quickly after fermentation or transfer it to a narrow-necked jug or carbony air-locked container to limit air exposure.\n\nThis summary tackles specific issues in fermenting processes and provides practical solutions to address or prevent these problems."

Here is the structured content from the document:\n\n### Stirring Cocktails\n- **Efficiency and Control**: The text highlights the importance of finding the right balance of speed, efficiency, and control. Quick dilution can be achieved with crushed ice or tiny pellets, though this increases the risk of over-dilution.\n- **Ice Mentioned**: Specifically, Kold-Draft ice, which produces 1¼-inch cubes, is recommended. These cubes stack in neat layers inside a mixing glass and are large enough to dilute the drink slowly while reducing stirring time. The use of larger ice cubes is said to offer a substantial surface area that keeps stirring time short and is beneficial for making drinks at home.\n\n### Ingredients\n- **Dilution Needs**: Varies from cocktail to cocktail. Generally, drinks made with high-proof spirits need more water and will take longer to reach dilution. For instance:\n  - Sazerac or a dry martini (as stronger cocktails) need more water and longer to dilute.\n  - Manhattan or a classic fifty-fifty martini dilutes more quickly.\n\n### Shaking Cocktails\n- **Metaphor Usage**: The document uses imagery comparing stirring techniques to the movie \"The Karate Kid\" and shaking to the dynamics observed in Major League Baseball pitchers. \n- **Variability in Style**: Just as baseball pitchers have their unique styles and mechanics, bartenders have their distinctive shaking styles. These styles are seen as unique signatures reflecting a combination of natural incline, training, and individual personality.\n- **Philosophy on Teaching Technique**: It is noted that there is no ideal shaking technique imposed on bartenders at the establishment discussed. This notion emphasizes personal expressiveness and skills honed through extensive experience.\n\n### General Overview\n- **Bartending as an Art**: The text explores the idea that both stirring and shaking cocktails is akin to an art form, wherein each bartender's individuality plays a crucial role in the creative process.\n\nThis document seems to be from a training manual or an educational resource aimed at bartending professionals or enthusiasts, emphasizing the art and science behind cocktail preparation."

Here's a structured summary of the key sections and topics discussed in the document.\n\n---\n\n**Page Title: A SURVEY OF COMMON VEGETABLES**\n**Page Number: 340**\n\n### 1. Overview of Olives \n- **Bitter Phenolic Compounds**: Olives contain phenolic compounds providing protection from both microbes and mammals, with seeds dispersed mainly by birds.\n- **Bitterness and Color**: The bitterness of olives can be moderated or removed by curing techniques. They contain purplish anthocyanin pigments in the outer layer of the fruit.\n- **Olive Oil Production**: About 90% of harvested olives worldwide go into making olive oil.\n\n### 2. Making Olive Oil\n- **Process**:\n  - Made from olives that are 6 to 8 months old.\n  - Olives start green and turn to purple, losing the valued green color during ripening.\n  - Olives are crushed and ground into a paste to break fruit cells, then mixed for 20-40 minutes to separate oil.\n  - Oil extraction includes several phases: malaxation, pressing, and potential heating of the paste.\n  - Extracted oil is categorized by quality, with \"extra virgin\" oil being the highest quality obtained through the first cold pressing.\n\n### 3. Quality of Olive Oil\n- **Flavor and Content**:\n  - Quality is defined by flavor and the content of \"free fatty acids.\"\n  - EU regulations state that extra virgin olive oil must contain less than 0.8% free fatty acids.\n  - Higher free fatty acid content indicates lesser quality, but desirable flavor molecules including monounsaturated fats and polyphenols enhance the oil's quality.\n  - Producers often blend refined or lower quality oils with virgin oil to enhance flavor.\n\n### 4. Storing Olive Oil\n- **Storage Importance**:\n  - Virgin olive oils should be stored dark to prevent photodegradation and staling, preserving beneficial antioxidants, carotenoids, and tocopherols which are sensitive to light.\n  \n### 5. The Color and Flavor of Olive Oil\n- **Components**:\n  - Olive oil's color is due to chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments.\n  - Contains phenolic compounds, terpenes (citrusy and floral), and fruit ester compounds adding to its aromatic complexity.\n  \nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of olive traits, processing into oil, and factors affecting its quality and storage."

Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Image Description:\n- The image shows a tube filled with a clarifying process byproduct in a centrifuge. The substance on the bottom called a \"puck\" is the compressed solid separated from the liquid through centrifugation.\n\n### Main Text:\n1. **Introduction to Centrifuges**:\n   - A brief mention of using a sub-$200 centrifuge to separate components in a solution, setting the stage for discussing the utility and economic feasibility of centrifuges.\n\n2. **Centrifuge Problems and Forecast**:\n   - **Current Status**: As of writing (without a specific year mentioned), centrifuges are still not common, but a significant change is expected.\n   - **Cost**: In 2013, a capable centrifuge cost around $8000, accommodating the scale of a small business but was still somewhat impractical due to its small capacity and high cost relative to its function.\n   - **Prediction**: The author predicts a dramatic reduction in costs and increase in availability akin to the microwave. It is forecasted that professional-grade centrifuges will be available under $1000 within the next ten years, suggesting a shift from being a niche technology to a mainstream appliance.\n\n3. **Personal Experience**:\n   - **Initial Usage**: The author started using centrifuges in 2008, utilizing a friend's facility at NYU lab, highlighting the exclusivity and specialized nature of the equipment.\n   - **Capability**: The centrifuge could spin 500 milliliters of juice at 48,000 times the force of gravity, focusing on the specific use in clarifying lime juice which doesn't start clarifying until the centrifuge gets to about 27,000 g's.\n\n4. **Limitations and Practical Concerns**:\n   - **Technical Limits**: The discussion includes the limitations of higher capacity centrifuges, which can be more expensive and less practical for use in regular bars or small businesses due to their cost, massive size, and over-efficiency which sometimes results in metallic-tasting lime juice.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The author ultimately expresses a combination of optimism for the technology's future affordability and widespread adoption, comparing upcoming changes in the centrifuge market to those seen with microwaves, but also notes the practical and economic barriers that currently limit its use in smaller and less specialized settings."

Based on the text, it refers to a scenario where if a drink (specifically wine) had been poisoned, the sommelier (a wine expert) would be the first individual to be aware of this fact. This might be from a story, a historical account, or a fictional narrative discussing the role of a sommelier in detecting poisoned beverages."

Here's the structured content based on the details provided:\n\n### Aging Process\n- **Legal Requirement**: Bottles must rest in the cellars for at least fifteen months.\n- **Common Practice**: Most producers leave the bottles for about three years.\n- **Condition**: The wine rests **sur lie** (on the yeasts), which imparts a profound effect on the wine.\n- **Autolysis Process**: Yeasts' cell walls begin to disintegrate, releasing amino acids, lipids, and enzymes into the wine, which increases its creaminess and complexity.\n- **Sensory Impact**: Long aging on the yeasts enhances the Champagne with a creaminess described as contrapuntal tension, similar to a split second flash of lightning (referred to as **from sur lie aging**).\n\n### Clarification Process (Riddling)\n- **Description**: Initially, the non-vintage Champagne would be cloudy with yeast cells.\n- **Riddling Method**: Bottles are turned upside down, rotated about twenty-five times in A-shaped frames called **pupitres**.\n- **Manual Labor**: Traditionally, this was done manually by a **rémeur**, who could handle 30,000 to 40,000 bottles a day.\n- **Modern Methods**: Most prestige cuvée Champagnes still use traditional methods, but non-vintage Champagnes now often use large machines called gyropalettes.\n- **Time Efficiency**: Gyropalettes can complete the riddling process in one to two weeks, compared to two months or more when using **pupitres**.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- **Visual Callout**: An image caption notes \"Magnums of Ruinart Blanc de Blancs lie in the house's spectacular crayères.\"\n\n### Summary Box: The Punt\n- **Misconception**: It's a common erroneous practice to pour Champagne by holding the bottle by the punt (the indentation at the bottom of the bottle).\n- **Original Purpose**: Originally, the punt was simply the residual mark left from the bottle-making process when glass bottles were blown and shaped, not intended for aiding in pouring."

    "contenu": "The document provided discusses two main topics: cheesecake cooling and cream strategies, as well as a snippet on a medieval cheesecake recipe. Here is the structured content breakdown:\n\n### Cheesecake Cooling Strategies:\n1. **Problem Noted**:\n   - Cheesecakes can develop depressions and cracks as they cool, caused by the mix expanding and then shrinking. Properly managed cooling is essential.\n\n2. **Strategies for Cooling Cheesecake**:\n   - **Beat the ingredients slowly and only long enough** to obtain an even mix to minimize air bubbles that expand during baking.\n   - **Bake the cheesecake slowly** in a low oven to allow trapped air and steam to disperse gradually and evenly.\n   - **Do not overbake** as it dries the filling and causes it to shrink from moisture loss. Cooling the cheesecake gradually in the open oven helps contract trapped air or steam more gradually, which helps prevent the surface from pulling in.\n\n### Cream Theory and Practice:\n1. **Properties**:\n   - Creams are generally easier than custards as they are heated on the stove and not served as in the container they are cooked in.\n\n2. **Handling Pourable and Stiff Creams**:\n   - **Pourable creams** like crème anglaise are meant to have a consistency of heavy cream at serving temperature.\n   - **Stiff creams** need substantial amounts of flour or cornstarch and must be boiled. They contain enzymes making them heat resistant.\n\n3. **Storage Tips**:\n   - Creams must be protected from forming a leathery skin due to evaporation. Suggestions include dotting the warm surface with milkfat or using waxed paper or plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent evaporation.\n\n### A Medieval Cheesecake Recipe:\n- **Tart de bry**\n  - **Ingredients**: Egg yolks, good fat cheese, ginger, cinnamon, sugar, saffron.\n  - **Instructions**: Mix all ingredients, place in a crust, and bake.\n\nThis breakdown is based on the thematic content discussed in the provided document page."

While modern culture tends to overlook acorns as viable food, ironically, the looming threat of global food shortages is frequently cited to justify environmental interventions like deforestation and the advancement of biotechnology. This document advocates exploring acorns as an underutilized food resource, dismissing the notion of scarcity propagated in contemporary dialogue.\n\n#### Recommendations and Preparations\n\n- **Harvesting**: Collect acorns in the fall, discarding any with visible damage such as worm holes. Prior to storage, acorns should be air-dried, and it’s acceptable if they have begun to sprout.\n- **California Acorn Enthusiast Suellen Ocean**: She prefers sprouted acorns as they boost nutritional value by transitioning the starch content to sugars which makes them sweeter and also simplifies the removal from the shell.\n- **Processing**: Acorns contain tannins, which are harmful in large amounts and must be leached out before consumption. This involves:\n  - **Removing Shells**: Shell the acorns.\n  - **Grinding**: Use a mortar and pestle, mill, or a mechanical blender to grind the acorns.\n  - **Leaching**: Soak the ground acorns in water to leach out tannins. This can be done in static water soaks or more efficiently in a flowing stream with the acorns in a mesh bag.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBy utilizing these methods, the edible potential of acorns can be fully harnessed, contributing to dietary diversity and food security without undue environmental compromise."

The content is structured alphabetically with each term followed by its definition or explanation. Here's the structured content returned in Markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### C\n\n**COULURE:**\nThe failure of grapes to develop after flowering occurs due to weather conditions like spring cold, rain, high temperatures, or insufficient biorhythms. This often results in irregular grape bunches that experience **coulure**, also called **SHATTER** in English.\n\n**CRAYÈRES:**\nThese are deep chalk pits used by Champagne houses for aging, originally created by the Romans near Reims for their cool, dark, and humid environments.\n\n**CRÉMANT:**\nThis term is reserved for sparkling wines made outside the Champagne region, under the MÉTHODE CHAMPENOISE. Since 1994, the term is not permitted to be used in Champagne but can be used to describe similar wines from other regions in France.\n\n**CRU:**\nRefers to a vineyard or an estate known for its superior quality. The term originates from the French verb **croître** meaning \"to grow.\"\n\n**CUVÉE:**\nDenotes wine from a specific barrel or vat, often used to describe a blend of wines aimed at producing a unique flavor profile or standard.\n\n**CUVERIE:**\nThe place where wine fermentation takes place, typically referring to the building housing these fermentation tanks.\n\n---\n\n### D\n\n**DÉGORGEMENT:**\nThe process of removing yeast sediments from a champagne bottle through disgorgement, part of the secondary fermentation process.\n\n**DEMI-SEC:**\nA type of sparkling wine with 33 to 50 grams of sugar per liter, making it sweeter than EXTRA DRY and BRUT.\n\n**DE PRIMEUR:**\nThe sale of wines soon after harvest before they have been bottled. Commonly associated with wines from Bordeaux.\n\n**DOMAINE:**\nA winery, often incorporating the term in its name to signify prestige, such as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.\n\n**DOSAGE:**\nThe final addition of \"liqueur d'expédition\" to adjust the sweetness of champagne before sealing, dictating whether the wine will be classified as **BRUT, EXTRA DRY,** or **DEMI-SEC.**\n\n---\n\n### E\n\n**EAU-DE-VIE:**\nLiterally translated as \"water of life,\" refers to spirits distilled from wine or POMACE.\n\n**ENCÉPAGEMENT:**\nThe range of grape varieties used in a specific wine.\n\n**EN COTEAUX:**\nVines planted on slopes, typically producing superior wines.\n\n**EN PRIMEUR:**\nSelling of wines while still aging, common for securing large investments in potentially valuable wines, especially from Bordeaux.\n\n**EXTRA BRUT:**\nA very dry Champagne with minimal added sweetness, even drier than **BRUT.**\n\n---"

    "contenu": "The document discusses the thermal dynamics and management of aerobic composting. Here's the key information structured into sections:\n\n### Key Facts:\n1. **Composition and Smell of Aerobic Compost:**\n   - Aerobic compost commonly has an earthy aroma and may include materials like formaldehyde and volatile acids.\n   - It does not necessarily smell like a fetid swamp, which is more characteristic of anaerobic compost.\n\n2. **Conditions and Benefits of Aerobic Composting:**\n   - A well-maintained aerobic compost pile should be at least a cubic yard in size and moist but not waterlogged.\n   - This type of compost pile generates heat, which is beneficial as it kills weed seeds, pathogenic bacteria, and pests, speeding up the decomposition process.\n\n3. **Temperature Management:**\n   - The optimal heat range within the compost pile should be maintained. Heat above 131°F (55°C) is beneficial, but temperatures above 158°F (70°C) can cause the pile to go anaerobic due to excessive heat in the center where oxygen is least available.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Maintenance Techniques:**\n   - A compost pile that consistently produces heat can be used for practical purposes like cooking food indirectly or heating a greenhouse.\n   - It’s crucial to monitor the pile's temperature, particularly when it exceeds 150°F (66°C). Regular turning of the pile helps in dissipating heat, aerating the pile, and redistributing materials for balanced microbial activity.\n   - Turning the pile can be mechanized (using a tractor) or manual (using a shovel or pitchfork), impacting the time and effort involved.\n\n5. **Personal Experience and Observations:**\n   - The author shares experiences from a friend's farm where a large thermometer is used to monitor compost temperature and a tractor is used to turn the pile, which facilitates the managing process.\n\n6. **Process Duration and Maturation:**\n   - After several weeks and a few turns of the pile, the microbial activity stabilizes, allowing the compost to mature over several months.\n\nThis structured breakdown covers the detailed process and considerations for maintaining an efficient aerobic composting system, emphasizing the importance of temperature control and physical management of the compost pile."

Refrigerate any remaining dressing for another salad. Bring it to room temperature before using.) Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and serve.\n\n### Variation\nYou can broil or grill the chicken breasts instead of frying them. You can also poach them, though they are best with a bit of texture on the outside. Try some sweet sliced jicama in place of the cucumber, and use toasted pine nuts as a sweeter substitute for toasted sesame seeds.\n\n### Commentary\nJoyce: \"This chicken salad is an ideal hot-weather main-course dish, and it deserves a good glass of wine. Mild chicken, cool, crisp romaine, slightly bitter cucumber, cilantro, and green onions are tossed with a creamy sesame-ginger dressing for a perfect balance of flavors.\"\n\nEvan: \"This is a wonderfully harmonious match. The crispness of the Riesling is splendid against the crunchy romaine and cucumber (or my personal preference, jicama). The off-dry sweetness of the wine balances perfectly with the slight earthy sweetness of the sesame-ginger dressing, while the wine's fruit flavors are set off gently by the toasted sesame seeds. The greens are nice for making this dish into a salad but are not the focal point. I've mixed a bit of the extra dressing into some mayonnaise, spread it on bread, added a lettuce leaf for crispness, and used this salad for a marvelous twist on the chicken-salad sandwich. It makes a perfect picnic combination when you add sun, a beautiful location, and a few good friends.\"\n\n### Recommended Producers\nRecommended wines are Apple- and Apricot-Flavored, Dry or Slightly Off-Dry Rieslings, categorized under the headings \"Everyday,\" \"Premium,\" and \"Splurge\":\n\n**Everyday:**\n- Dr. Bürklin-Wolf (Pfalz, Germany)\n- St. Urbans-Hof (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany)\n- Navarro (Mendocino County, California)\n\n**Premium:**\n- J.

They can be fermented using various plants aimed at enhancing well-being or healing. Traditionally, Ayurvedic medicine utilizes fermented beverages like _arishthas_ and _asavas_ to deliver botanical medicine effectively. These products are noted for their preservative properties and the ability to potentiate drug effects through biotransformation mediated by native microbes. This results in improved drug extraction and delivery, often using tinctures, which are plant extracts dissolved in alcohol. As alcohol acts both as a solvent and a preservative, it helps in extracting phytochemicals into a stable medium without necessarily being distilled.\n\n#### Personal Insight\nThe concept of _herbal elixir mead_ was introduced to the author by a friend, Frank Cook, who passed away in 2009. Frank was an enthusiastic plant explorer who traveled globally to meet various plants and healers. His adventures took him from California to North Carolina, focusing on understanding different plant families. Despite his early death at 47, he nearly mastered the understanding of 500 plant families and was deeply engaged in teaching and sharing his knowledge about plant medicine integrated into elixirs and meads."

    "contenu": "### FEELING THE TEXTURE\n\nClosely related to body is texture, sometimes called mouthfeel. A wine’s texture is the tactile impression it has in your mouth. This impression is the result of stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. (The largest of the cranial nerves, the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensations in the face and mouth.) Fabrics are often used as metaphors for texture or mouthfeel. A wine can be as soft as flannel (an Australian shiraz, for example), as seamlessly smooth as silk (a pinot noir), or as coarse and scratchy as wool (some southern French reds feel this way). It can also feel syrupy, gritty, crackling crisp, or have any of dozens of other textures. In order to assess a wine’s texture, you must roll it around in your mouth and feel it. And what’s causing a wine’s texture in the first place? Acidity, tannin, alcohol, ripeness, and sweetness, to name the major influencers.\n\nTexture is probably the least talked-about dimension of wine, but I’d argue that, with food, it’s one of the key characteristics in determining preferences. Does anyone think that the texture of, say, steak is beside the point? That it’s only the flavor of the steak that counts? Similarly, it’s rarely just the lightly herbal, minerally flavors of Sancerre that someone loves, it’s also Sancerre’s spring-loaded snap of crispness.\n\n#### HOW FAST ARE YOUR TASTEBUDS?\n\nAccording to Dr. Hildegarde Heymann, a professor and enologist in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, the human body can taste faster than it can see, touch, or hear. Taste perception is swift because the tongue and mouth (assisted by the nose) are the body’s primary defenses against poison. Here's how fast perception occurs after initial stimulation, as measured in thousandths of a second, for our four main senses:\n\n| Sense   | Response Time (milliseconds) |\n|---------|-------------------------------|\n| TASTE   | 1.5–4.0                        |\n| TOUCH   | 2.4–8.9                        |\n| HEARING | 13–22                          |\n| VISION  | 13–45                          |"

Here, in the city where psychoanalysis was born, a coffeehouse is home to a complex ritual—more intimate than social, supremely private even within the public domain.\n\nTraditionally, coffeehouses were more or less demarcated by profession or social ranking. There were coffeehouses for politicians, coffeehouses for artists, coffeehouses for scholars, and so on. Every person had a single place to which he or she went exclusively. At a minimum, you spent an hour at a coffeehouse (no quickly-downed espressos), but more commonly, you would spend several hours and possibly the entire day there. Coffee would be ordered by color—gold, light gold, blond, dark gold—according to the amount of milk added, and would be served on a small tray with a few sugar cubes and a glass of water. The main activity was, and still is, reading newspapers provided by the house, although you could also write or work in complete solitude, using the café table as a private desk. Since the waiters knew every customer and his or her preferred coffee, you never really had to utter a single word. When people did go to the coffeehouse in pairs, it was either to read in mutual silence or to discuss problems or personal intimacies. Still, private conversation, not social banter, was the custom.\n\nModern life has changed Viennese coffeehouses, but not by much. During the daytime, a respectful solemnity still prevails. People just sit, think, read, and sip coffee. At night, coffeehouses become somewhat more animated, serving goulash and then coffee and strudel to opera-and theatergoers.\n\nIn the late fall and winter, coffee can become more substantial, including a particularly fortifying rendition called a *fiaker*. Made with liberal amounts of rum and whipped cream, *fiakers* are named after the open horse-drawn carriages that once transported people through the streets of Vienna. Riding in a *fiaker* on a cold Austrian night made you want to stop and sip a *fiaker*.\n\nAmong Vienna's best coffeehouses: Café Hawelka, Café Landtmann, Café Sacher, Café Sperl, Demel Konditorei, and Heiner Konditorei.\n\n### Wines of Austria\n\nIf Grüner Veltliner is Austria’s signature gift to the world of white wine, then Blaufränkisch is its red gift. Undoubtedly noble in origin and very old (though its parentage isn’t completely clear), Blaufränkisch combines the words *blau*, meaning “blue,” and *fränkisch*, an old German designation for “a fine wine.” Austrian Blaufränkisch is precise and sleek—spicy, herbal, and floral—and all of this plus the flavors of delicious woodland berries and a sense of forestiness. Most of all, Blaufränkisch has grip and bite. It is exactly what one so often wants in order to splice through the meatiness of meat. Despite its appeal, Blaufränkisch is not the leading red grape of Austria. That would be Zweigelt. A cross of Blaufränkisch and a usually more simple grape called St. Laurent, Zweigelt makes a juicy, fruity, easy wine."

The vineyards here, along with those in Hungary, formed a vast, uninterrupted sea of vines during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Burgenland is known primarily for its opulent sweet wines, as well as some remarkable reds.\n\nSweet wines have been the glory of this part of central Europe for eons. The most celebrated type—_ausbruch_—is made mostly from grapes infected by _Botrytis cinerea_, although some of the grapes can simply be dried and shriveled. For _ausbruch_, these grapes are then mixed with freshly pressed must from grapes that are only partially botrytized. (Reflecting Burgenland’s proximity to Hungary, this process is similar to the manner in which Hungary’s famous sweet wine, Tokaji Aszú, is made; see page 632.) Both the fully and partially botrytized grapes for _ausbruch_ must come from the same vineyard. The grapes are sometimes foot-trodden, and the wine is aged in casks. _Ausbruch_ is more baroque, outrageous, bruléed, and honeyed than _beerenauslese_, but has less residual sugar and more alcohol than _trockenbeerenauslese_.\n\nThe most famous _ausbruch_ etc., as well as BAs and TBAs, are made possible by a hauntingly beautiful natural entity: an almost supernatural lake poised between northern Burgenland and Hungary named Neusiedl (the Austrians call this the Neusiedlersee). More than 186 square miles (482 square kilometers) in size, it is only 2 to 7 feet (0.6 to 2 meters) deep. The shallow lake gives up so much humidity that it is threatened by constant evaporation. In fact, twice during the past century it dried up completely. Reeds and grasses love the lake. So many of them grow around it that thatching material developed into a local industry. Birds also love the lake. Indeed, the vast bird population has resulted in the area becoming one of Europe’s largest wildlife preserves. And thanks to the thousands of storks that nest and feed here, the lake has been called a stork smorgasbord. But as much as the reeds or the birds, grapes love the lake. It’s where they love to rot."

Below are the key points detailed in the text:\n\n1. **Characteristics of Vin Santo:**\n   - Vin Santo is not typically served at ceremonial occasions but is a customary conclusion to even modest Tuscan meals, enjoyed with small biscotti called cantucci.\n   - The wine, known for its delicate, creamy, honey-roasted flavor, can have a color range from radiant amber to neon orange.\n   - Its sweetness levels vary, and some Vin Santo wines can even be bone-dry.\n\n2. **Production Method:**\n   - The production of Vin Santo remains artisanal and labor-intensive.\n   - The process starts with the drying of partially dried grapes such as malvasia bianca lunga or trebbiano, which are hung in airy places like attics to concentrate the sugars.\n   - This is followed by crushing the grapes, blending with madre (a remnant of residue from previous batches), and fermenting in sealed barrels for three to five years in warm locations.\n   - Commonly oak barrels are used, but some producers use barrels made from different types of wood like juniper, cherry, and chestnut to enhance the complexity of the wine’s flavor.\n\n3. **Outcome Variabilities:**\n   - The meticulous process of making Vin Santo can sometimes lead to the production of high-quality vinegar if the winemaking process does not yield the desired outcome.\n\nThe document covers the traditional aspects and modern adaptations in the making of Vin Santo, presenting an informative outline of both the cultural significance and the detailed production techniques of this historical wine."

They are particularly useful when explaining the differences in both wine styles among producers and wine tastes among consumers. The winemaking style of classic Old World regions, including France and Italy, is rooted in centuries of tradition and emphasizes distinctiveness, or typicity. Terroir is the term used to describe the individuality of a given site for grapes, its flavor fingerprint independent of the stylistic inputs of the winemaker. The Old World is, or at least once was, more focused on celebrating the special characteristics inherent in each vineyard, whether the soil types that impart unique flavor characteristics or the distinctive differences among vintages. New World regions such as the United States and Chile, by contrast, are pioneering an approach that relies more on technological innovation and stylized winemaking formulas to achieve commercial acceptance. The newcomers are most comfortable in the position of control, from irrigation of the vineyards to cultured strains of yeast. This approach leaves little to chance, trusting in better living through wine chemistry.\"\n\n---\n\n**Author Info:**\n\nRandall Grahm is the founder and fearless leader of Bonny Doon Vineyard and one of California’s most eccentric and influential vintners. Like Columbus seeking a trade route to Asia, Grahm set sail in 1979 for the Great American Pinot Noir, foundered on the shoals of astringency and finesselessness, and ended up running aground in the utterly unexpected New World of Rhône and Italian grape varieties. A citizen of the world, he is perhaps best known as a champion of the strange and the heterodox, of the ugly duckling grape varieties whose very existence is threatened by the dominant Cabo- and Chardo-centric paradigms."

Fermentation temperatures above 95°F/35°C make the soybeans highly susceptible to Bacillus subtilis. While soybeans don't smell as sweet as when combined with roasted wheat, they still produce a pleasant aroma.\n\n#### **Reference to Related Content**\n\nThe text mentions a reference to \"Soy Sauce in chapter 11\" where the reader can find additional information related to the subject.\n\n#### **Propagation of Koji Starter (Tane Koji)**\n\nThe process of propagating koji starter, using brown rice (referred to as \"seed koji\"), is outlined. White rice isn't used because it lacks essential nutrients required for optimal mold growth. \n\n- **Preparation of Rice:** The brown rice should be soaked, drained, steamed, and cooled. \n- **Inoculation:** Hardwood ashes are mixed in (about 1.5% by weight of the rice) to provide potassium, magnesium, and other nutrients. Then the rice is inoculated.\n- **Fermentation:** The inoculated mixture is incubated at approximately 79°F/26°C, initially for 24 hours. It's then remounted for another 24 hours, and after 48 hours, spread onto cotton and left undisturbed to encourage mold growth.\n- **Drying and Storage:** After a total of 96 hours and visible growth, the koji is dried in an oven or dehydrator at about 113°F/45°C and stored in a cool, dark place.\n  \n#### **Utilization**\n\nThe dried starter can be used whole, ground into meal, or further processed to extract spores. Mixing with flour is also suggested, particularly for miso production.\n\n#### **Reference Work**\n\nThe process described is sourced from Shurtleff and Aoyagi's book \"Miso Production,\" which further elaborates on the topic in a dedicated chapter.\n\n---\nThis breakdown provides a clearer structure of the steps necessary for the propagation of koji, important notes on temperatures for different stages of the process, and references for deeper understanding."

Here’s a structured breakdown of its content:\n\n### MY DRAFT SELTZER RIG:\n- **Description**: Regular tap water is filtered and runs to a McCann carbonator through blue lines. A pump in the carbonator forces the water under pressure into the stainless-steel carbonator tank, where CO2 is fed into the stainless tank at a pressure of 100–110 psi to supply gas and pressure (indicated by yellow lines).\n- **Process**: \n  - Room-temperature seltzer exits the tank and moves toward a cold plate in an ice machine (indicated by green lines).\n  - The seltzer runs through the cold plate twice, which is noted as a secret to the setup, and then exits and heads above the cabinet to the seltzer tap.\n\n### The Advantages of Using a Whipper with Nitrous Oxide for Carbonation:\n- **Purpose**: Allows for experimentation with nitrous oxide, commonly used for whipped cream, to carbonate drinks differently.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Nitrous oxide used in a whipper generally preserves the creamy taste without making the cream taste carbonated or spoiled.\n  - Although nitrous doesn’t significantly flavor whipped cream, it imparts a sweet flavor and is described as being noticeably sweet.\n  - It works well in coffee and chocolate-flavored drinks adding body and liveliness without excessive carbonation.\n- **Advice**:\n  - Avoid using milk in nitrous oxide-carbonated drinks as it foams excessively.\n- **Carbonation Technique**:\n  - For mixed gas drinks, start with normal carbonation using two CO2 cartridges, then finish with a nitrous oxide cartridge.\n  - Using a mix of gases, specifically 80% CO2 and 20% N₂O in super cold ice water, can replicate the flavor of a preferred bubbly water form.\n\nThere are no tables in the document to be structured, only text and image descriptions, which have been structured into the content above."

    "contenu": "### BORN TO RHÔNE\n\n**Randall Grahm and Bonny Doon Vineyard**\nRandall Grahm, the owner of Bonny Doon Vineyard, is an MIT-educated intellectual from the mid-eighties. Grahm was initially known for his innovative approach in winemaking at Bonny Doon, located in Santa Cruz. He is recognized for his idiosyncratic wines and unique methods of showcasing them, such as suspending Bonny Doon's flying machine from the ceiling of the tasting room.\n\n**A Shift to Rhône Varieties**\nDuring the 1970s in Los Angeles, Grahm started as a wine shop sales clerk and later founded Bonny Doon with financial support from his family. Grahm's turning point came within a decade when he embraced Rhône varieties, particularly syrah, grenache, marsanne, and roussanne. His first notable success was Cigare Volant, a style inspired by French Rhône wines. This wine catapulted him to fame and he began producing many successful varieties, which had been largely overlooked by other California winemakers at the time.\n\n**Other Notable Wineries in Monterey**\n- **David Bruce Winery**: Known for its pinot noirs, this winery embraces variations that range from great to eccentric, building a cult following.\n- **Mount Eden Vineyards**: Famous for its estate chardonnays, which were first planted in 1948 on a mountain crest in Monterey.\n\n**Monterey County Wine Region**\nMonterey County is the largest appellation in the northern part of the Central Coast, spanning about 40,000 acres of vines. This region, known for its fertile Salinas Valley, is dubbed the \"lettuce capital of the world\" and produces over 50 percent of the U.S. vegetables including broccoli, strawberries, mushrooms, spinach, artichokes, and chili peppers.\n\nMonterey's wine recognition only emerged in the 1960s and 1970s post extensive urban development in cities like San Jose and Santa Clara, which pushed vineyard investments southward due to soaring land prices in areas like Sonoma and Napa.\n\nThe climate of southern Monterey can be extremely hot, but the northern part benefits from chilly tunnel winds from the northern Pacific, crucial for cooling the coastal vineyards and promoting slow grape ripening. However, severe winds can inhibit photosynthesis by causing the bushes to shut down, which poses a challenge in an already cool climate region."

    "contenu": "The document provides insights into two notable aspects of wines, specifically focusing on Riesling and Sangiovese. Here's a structured content representation:\n\n### Riesling Wine Characteristics\n- **General Profile**: Rieslings from cooler climates, like Clare and Eden valleys in Australia, are typically vibrant and fresh, known as \"tightrope\" wines due to their balanced nature. In comparison, Rieslings from warmer regions, such as California, tend to be softer and less precise in their mineral flavors.\n- **Misconceptions on Sweetness**:\n  - **Common Assumption**: People often expect Riesling to be sweet.\n  - **Reality**: Most Rieslings globally are dry, with the exception of intentionally sweet styles like Beerenauslese (BA) and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA).\n- **Sweetness Determination**: The International Riesling Foundation (IRF) has developed a Riesling Taste Profile chart to assist in pinpointing whether a Riesling is sweet or dry based on technical guidelines such as sugar-to-acid ratio and the pH of the wine.\n\n### Sangiovese Wine Characteristics\n- **Regions**:\n  - **Primary**: Central Italy, specifically Tuscany (notable for Chianti Classico, vino nobile di Montepulciano, and brunello di Montalcino).\n  - **Other Regions**: Umbria and Emilia-Romagna in Italy; limited production in California.\n- **Genetics and Variations**:\n  - **DNA Research (2004)**: Identified one parent of Sangiovese as being from southern Italy (Calabrese di Montenuovo).\n  - **Varietal Complexity**: Variations in clones (hundreds to thousands) due to genetic instability.\n- **Soil and Style Variance**: Depending on the quality of the soil, Sangiovese wines can vary from poor (dry and dreary) to excellent (earthy, rich, and complex).\n- **Traditional Pairing**: Best combined with peppery extra virgin olive oil due to its earthy and rich flavor profile.\n\nThis summarizes the detailed points mentioned in the document about Riesling and Sangiovese wines."

Below is the structured content of the document:\n\n### Document Title:\nHOW TO GET A GRIP ON TANNIN IN RED WINES\n\n### Author:\nZelma Long\n#### Role:\nWinemaker\n\n### Main Topics Covered in the Document:\n\n#### Description of Tannin:\n- **Nature and Impact**: Tannin is an essential wine component primarily associated with red wines. It's recognized for its ability to influence the wine's astringency, which often results in a mouth-drying sensation. Despite this, tannin is indispensable in the wine-making process, contributing to the wine’s structure, aging potential, and overall quality. It is known for imparting complex flavors which might be bitter, harsh, or coarse.\n- **Source**: Tannins are derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of red grapes, and smaller quantities from oak barrels used during the aging process.\n- **Benefits**: Tannin contributes to the wine's velvety texture and aging capability. Additionally, tannins have health benefits linked to compounds found in them.\n\n#### Background on Zelma Long:\n- **Career Overview**: Zelma Long is noted as a significant figure in the world of wine, particularly notable for pioneering roles for women in the field. She first studied enology and viticulture at the University of California, Davis, began her career at Robert Mondavi Winery, and later moved on to become a prominent figure at Simi Winery and partner at Long Vineyards in Napa Valley. With over 30 years of experience in the industry, she and her husband Phil Freese also manage Vilafonté winery in South Africa, focusing on innovative wine production and vineyard management.\n- **Contributions**: Apart from her winemaking endeavors, Long has a profile in international wine-making consultation.\n\n### Footer:\n- Page Number: 65\n- Section Title: WINE TASTING\n\nThis document provides insights into the importance of tannins in wine production, emphasizing their crucial role in the quality and experience of red wine while highlighting Zelma Long's impactful career in the winemaking industry."

This marinade is also excellent for boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes and skewered. Chicken can marinate for 4 to 5 hours, fish, and shrimp need only a 1-2 hour marinade, as the yogurt and citrus have a tenderizing effect."

    "contenu": "### WHERE AND HOW SHOULD I STORE WINE?\n\nThe ancient Greeks mixed wine with honey (sugar acts as a preservative), poured olive oil on top of it (as a barrier to air), and stored it in large ceramic amphorae buried in the ground to keep the wine cool. For thousands of years, wine lovers have been motivated to store wine in a way that keeps it as wine, rather than expensive vinegar.\n\nBy the sixteenth century, much of the wine traded throughout Europe was high in alcohol and further fortified with brandy to preserve it. The base wine itself may have come from any warm place along the Mediterranean, from southern Spain to Crete. In many cases, the origin did not matter; what was important was that the raw wine be fortified sufficiently that it would still be drinkable when it reached England, Ireland, or northern Europe. Any wine that was not fortified was drunk immediately. These young, fresh wines were highly desirable. For most of history, in fact, young wine was always more expensive than old. Intentionally storing wine to age it came into practice only after the eighteenth century, when bottles came into widespread use. When aged in a bottle with a tight-fitting cork, wine not only did not turn to vinegar, but some of it actually improved—sometimes markedly so, especially if it was red. For the first time, certain older wines began to command a higher price than young wines. And “laying a wine down” to better it began to take on sophisticated connotations.\n\nCork—the historic closure for wine—is a miraculous material. But the 20th century gave us an additional asset: well-made, expensive screw caps.\n\nThe legacy remains. Aging a wine still seems like the right thing to do with a moderately expensive wine, even though the fact that most modern wine is actually not meant to be aged for long periods of time. Virtually all white wines and rosé wines are made to be drunk fresh and young. Even among red wines, only those with firm structure and impeccable balance are meant for the long haul. The French make a distinction."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"PDO, PGI–THE EUROPEAN UNION WINE LAWS,\" discusses the complexities of wine-producing laws in the European Union and certain national laws that exist simultaneously within the member states, focusing particularly on France, Italy, and Spain. Below is a structured summary of the document:\n\n1. **EU and National Wine Laws**\n   - **Context**: Each wine-producing country in Europe has specific national designations for wine, such as France's Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée (AOC) and Italy's Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC). \n   - **Introduction of EU Laws**: In 2009, the European Union introduced its own set of wine laws that apply to all member countries, including major wine producers like France, Italy, and Spain.\n\n2. **Main EU Wine Designations**\n   - **PDO (Protected Designation of Origin)**: This labeling is used for wines that are produced, processed, and prepared in a specific geographical area, and whose quality or properties are significantly or exclusively determined by the geographical environment.\n   - **PGI (Protected Geographical Indication)**: This designation allows wineries to use either their national labels or the PGI designation from the EU. For example, wines from the Bordeaux or Champagne areas can use either the French AOC or the EU PGI labels.\n\n3. **Usage and Impact of These Designations**\n   - **French Wineries**: They have the choice to label wines under commonly known national terms (e.g., *vin de pays*) or the newer EU terms like PGI.\n   - **Adaptations**: The term PGI, abbreviated from the French *Indication Géographique Protégée*, is gaining preference, and the use of traditional terms like *vin de pays* is now accompanied by the mandatory use of the PGI logo on labels.\n\n4. **Goals of EU Regulations**\n   - **Protection and Unification**: The EU aims to provide consumer protection and a unified labeling system that clearly identifies the quality and origin of wines. The EU system incorporates older systems like AOC and DOC and adds new categories like PDO and PGI.\n\n5. **Cultural Impact and Global Influence**\n    - **Historical Context**: French wines, often from renowned estates and châteaux, have been exported globally since the 17th century, influencing wine production in regions including South Africa, the Americas, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n6. **Future Content**\n    - The document mentions that it will explore France's most important wine regions in subsequent sections, suggesting a detailed look at the significance and hierarchy of these regions, possibly evaluating areas like Bordeaux, Champagne, and Burgundy.\n\nThis document not only elucidates the regulatory landscape for wine labeling within the European Union but also emphasizes the global cultural influence and historical significance of wine production, particularly in France."

    "contenu": "# COMMON FRUITS OF TEMPERATE CLIMATES\n\n### Types of Apples:\n\n#### 1. Cider Apples\n- **Example**: European native *Malus sylvestris*\n- **Characteristics**: High-acid fruits rich in astringent tannins. These tannins help control the alcoholic fermentation and clarify the liquid.\n- **Uses**: Mainly used only in cider making.\n\n#### 2. Dessert or Eating Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Crisp and juicy with a pleasing balance between sour and sweet when eaten raw. They become relatively bland when cooked.\n- **Common in**: Supermarkets and produce markets as dessert apples.\n\n#### 3. Cooking Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Distinctly tart when raw and well-balanced when cooked. They maintain structure well when heated in pies or tarts. Some early \"codling\" varieties turn into a fluffy froth.\n- **Notable Varieties**: \n  - France: *Calville blanc d’hiver*\n  - England: *Bramley’s Seedling*\n  - Germany: *Glockenapfel*\n\n#### 4. Dual-purpose Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Adequate either raw or cooked; best when young and tart, mellows as it ages.\n- **Examples**: \n  - *Golden Delicious*\n  - *Granny Smith*\n\n### Cooking Potential of Apples:\n- Can be tested by wrapping a few slices in aluminum foil and baking at a hot oven for 15 minutes, or microwaving till the covering bloats.\n\n### Apple Flavor Development:\n- **Connoisseurship**: Noted by Edward Bunyard on the evolution of flavor post-harvest.\n- **Storage**: Best stored in a cool and dry place and inspected periodically to catch volatile ethers at their developmental peak.\n- **Aging**: Apples mellow with time because they consume some of their cell acid for energy.\n\n### Fruit Aroma Compounds: Esters\n\nMany fruits develop their aroma from esters, which are a combination of an acid and an alcohol. Here are some examples of ester aroma compounds in fruits:\n\n- Ethyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Ethyl acetate (common in apples)\n- Hexyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Hexyl acetate (common in pears)\n- Ethyl alcohol + Butyric acid = Ethyl butyrate (common in pineapple)\n- Isoamyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Isoamyl acetate (common in bananas)"

Introduction of Leaf Structure and Function:**\n\n- Leaves are the most fragile and short-lived parts of the plant, designed to maximize light capture.\n- They are flattened into thin sheets with a large surface area densely packed with chloroplasts and filled with thousands of tiny air pockets, increasing the exposure to air.\n- Some leaves have up to 70% of their volume made up of air, helping them shrink when cooked due to the collapse of their spongy interior.\n\n**2. Exception to the Storage issue in Bulb Ornaments:**\n  \n- Plants like the onion family store nutrients in leaves, with multiple layers of cells that can thicken and support the plant.\n- The base of the leaf bases, especially in bulbs like onions and garlic, can store water which gets used in subsequent years of growth.\n\n**3. Flowers as Reproductive Organs:**\n\n- Flowers are reproductive structures where male pollen and female ovules are produced, leading to the development of seeds.\n- While flowers are often colorful to attract pollinators, some protect their flowers and are typically used as culinary ingredients (broccoli, cauliflower, artichokes, etc.).\n\n**4. Fruit Development:**\n  \n- Fruits are derived from the flower’s ovary and contain seeds.\n- They are designed to disperse seeds away from the parent plant, and although some are inedible when immature, the ones we eat develop flavors and nutritional content.\n\n**5. Texture of Raw Fruits and Vegetables:**\n\n- Describes how fruits and vegetables are juicy and soft, or could be mealy, dry, or chewy depending on their cell construction and water content.\n\n**6. Cellular Structure of Plant Tissues:**\n\n- Plant tissues are constructed with cell walls made from cellulose fibers and a semisolid mixture containing carbohydrates, proteins, and minerals.\n- These components provide structural integrity and contribute to the texture.\n\n**7. Role of Water in Crispness and Firmness:**\n\n- Discusses how cells use water as a reinforcing element within their structures, allowing fruits and vegetables to maintain a crisp texture.\n- When a plant’s cell reaches maximum water capacity, it becomes firm and crisp, relying on the surrounding cement-like semisolid materials.\n\n---\n\nThe text provides a comprehensive overview of various plant parts and their relevance to human consumption, emphasizing structural and functional aspects of leaves, flowers, and fruits, as well as a discussion on the texture of edible plant parts."

Its bitter, full-bodied flavor profile includes cocoa, orange, caramel, and figs, along with a big vanilla note. In cocktails it's a versatile modifier that can both complement and contrast with other flavors, though it can sometimes be a bully in the glass compared to other vermouths. There was a time when we were putting Carpano in everything, especially any variation on the Manhattan. Those were the days when Death & Co was defining “stirred and bitter” as a category. Since then we’ve mellowed a bit to include other vermouths.\n\n**Cocchi Vermouth di Torino:** Like Carpano Antica (to which it is stylistically similar), this sweet vermouth has a strong vanilla note and a rich, compelling body, but unlike Carpano it lets other ingredients shine through in cocktails.\n\n**Dolin Blanc Vermouth:** With its full body and sweetness, Dolin blanc works like a red vermouth and pairs well with base spirits that would overpower a dry vermouth, especially blanco tequila. We reach for this when introducing guests to stirred, boozy drinks, as it lightens the intensity of the drink without masking other flavors.\n\n**Dolin Dry Vermouth:** This beautiful, soft, dry vermouth has gentle herbaceous flavors and a touch of sweetness. It pairs nicely with subtly flavored base spirits by stretching out their flavors and is the base ingredient in Alex's Aperitivo Julep.\n\n**Dolin Rouge Vermouth:** Made from wine and botanicals from Chambéry, France, Dolin rouge is drier and lighter bodied than Carpano Antica or Cocchi Torino, which makes it too wimpy to stand up to bigger brown spirits (unless we’re making a Manhattan with a wheat-heavy bourbon; then it’s just right). To remedy this, we mix equal parts Dolin rouge and Punt e Mes to make our House Sweet Vermouth.\n\n**Punt e Mes:** This very poignant sweet vermouth is almost amaro-like in its sharp taste."

These categories are detailed with descriptions and examples as follows:\n\n### Cheese Categories:\n1. **Fresh**\n   - Description: Unripened and unaged cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and feta.\n   - Characteristics: Versatile and mild flavor.\n\n2. **Semi-Soft**\n   - Description: Cheeses that give a bit when squeezed; examples include teleme and Havarti.\n   - Characteristics: They soften as they ripen, higher salt content and edible fuzzy rind. \n\n3. **Soft-Ripened**\n   - Description: Cheeses that soften rather than harden as they age.\n   - Examples: Brie and Camembert.\n   - Characteristics: Higher moisture content with an edible rind.\n\n4. **Semi-Hard**\n   - Description: Balanced salt and fat, very flexible cheeses.\n   - Examples: Basic Cheddar to Gouda.\n   - Characteristics: Range from buttery to nutty flavors, includes interpretations like Emmentaler and Comté.\n\n5. **Hard**\n   - Description: Often sharp and quite firm cheeses.\n   - Examples: Parmesan, aged Cheddar, and dry Jack.\n   - Characteristics: Salty and ideal for shaving.\n\n6. **Blue**\n   - Description: Identified by blue or green mold.\n   - Examples: Gorgonzola to Roquefort.\n   - Characteristics: Salty and strong flavor, from mild sweetness to intense dolce.\n\n7. **Washed-Rind**\n   - Description: Often known as the “stinky socks” category since these cheeses are washed with brine, wine or brandy during the ripening process.\n   - Examples: Taleggio, Munster, and Époisses.\n   - Characteristics: Smell stronger than they taste, edible but strong rind that is often off-putting to some.\n\nThe document underscores how cheese, like wine, can vary significantly in taste depending on its origin and suggests pairing specific categories of cheese with different wines to enrich the tasting experience. Additionally, the text includes insights from a noted cheese expert and author, Laura Werlin, to delineate the categories and pairing recommendations."

    "contenu": "### THE HISTORY OF SAUCES IN EUROPE\n\nEurope is one of several regions in the world that have evolved sauces with broad appeal in modern times. Many sauces are now popular far from their birthplaces, among them Chinese soy-based sauces, Indian sauces thickened and flavored with spices, and Mexican salsas and chili-thickened moles. But it was in Europe, more precisely in France, that generations of cooks developed sauce making into a systematic art, and made it the heart of a national cuisine that became an international standard.\n\n#### ANCIENT TIMES\n\nOur first real knowledge of sauce-like preparations in Europe comes from Roman times. A Latin poem from around 25 CE describes a peasant farmer making a spread of pounded herbs, cheese, oil, and vinegar—an ancestor of pesto genovese—that gave a pungent, salty, aromatic savor to his flatbread (see box, p. 583).\n\nA few centuries later, the Latin recipe book attributed to Apicius makes it clear that sauces played an essential part in the dining of the Roman elite. More than a quarter of the nearly 500 recipes are for sauces, the term for which was ius, the ancestor of our “juice.” Most contained at least a half dozen herbs and spices, as well as vinegar and/or honey, and some form of the fermented fish sauce garum (p. 235), which provided saltiness, savoriness, and a distinctive aroma (much as anchovies do today). And they were thickened in a variety of ways: with the pounded flavorings themselves; with pounded nuts or rice; with pounded liver or sea urchins; with pounded bread, pieces of pastry, and with pure wheat starch itself; with egg yolks, both raw and boiled.\n\n### Harmonizing Flavors in Ancient China\n\nThe addition, intensification, and blending of flavors that characterize good sauce making are central to the art of cooking, and have been considered such for at least 2,000 years. Here is an ancient Chinese description of the process that centers on the making of a stew or soup, a preparation in which the solid food both provides part of the sauce and cooks in the sauce.\n\nIn the business of harmonious blending, one must make use of the sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty. Whether things are to be added earlier or later and in what amounts—their balancing is very subtle and each thing has its own characteristic. The transformation which occurs in the cauldron is quintessential and wondrous, subtle and delicate. The mouth cannot express it in words; the mind cannot fix upon an analogy. It is like the subtlety of archery and horsemanship, the transformation of Yin and Yang, or the revolution of the four seasons. Thus [the food] is long-lasting yet does not spoil; thoroughly cooked yet not mushy; sweet yet not cloying; sour yet not corrosive; salty yet not deadening; pungent yet not acrid; mild yet not insipid; oily-smooth yet not greasy.\n\n—attributed to the chef Yi Yin in the Lü Shi Chun Qiu (Master Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals), 239 BCE, transl. Donald Harper and H. T. Huang"

The content is structured into a main article and a table that describes ingredient pairings with bergamot orange. Below is a detailed breakdown of both sections:\n\n### Main Article\n\n**Header: Bergamot**\n\n1. **Description and Sensory Profile:**\n   - Bergamot oranges are notable for their \"unmistakably lemon-orange aroma,\" but they also have \"floral, rose-like notes\" and a complex fragrance.\n   - Upon deeper inhalation, scents of \"underlying herbal, piney notes\" can be detected.\n   - The fruit is described as having an \"unpalatably bitter, acidic taste\" and is primarily cultivated for its essential oils. The bright green outer peel of the fruit is cold-pressed to extract its essence, which is clear and yellowish-green.\n   - The oils are commonly utilized in liqueurs, perfumes, and other cosmetics.\n\n2. **Uses and Applications:**\n   - In their natural state, bergamot oranges are generally considered inedible but are intriguingly sour, adding a unique twist to cocktails, savory dishes, and pastries.\n   - High-quality bergamot oils are extracted primarily in Southern Italy and are recognized under the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status within the European Union.\n\n3. **Historical and Cultural References:**\n   - Bergamot oil has a flavor comparable to some premium Chinese teas, particularly Fou Shou oolong tea. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was fashionable in Europe to make Earl Grey tea more exclusive by adding a bit of bergamot oil.\n   - It is suggested that Earl Grey tea was a blend given to the 2nd Earl Grey by a Chinese mandarin.\n\n4. **Additional Notes:**\n   - The bergamot is also related to the *Monarda* genus of North American plants, known for their aromatic foliage and used by Native American tribes.\n   - Suggestions for culinary uses include a bergamot-scented vinaigrette and using bergamot to enhance flavors in desserts, dishes, and salads.\n\n### Ingredient Pairings with Bergamot Orange Table\n\nThe table lists various ingredients and their compatibility with bergamot orange across five categories: drink, meat, vegetable, dairy, and dessert.

Below is a structured summary of the key points mentioned in the text:\n\n### Benefits of Mixed-Culture Sourdough\n- **Nutritional Enhancement**: Mixed-culture sourdough is noted for increasing the available lysine content and reducing the presence of gluten.\n  \n### Basic Sourdough Starter Recipe\n- **Initial Mixing**: Combine a small amount of flour and water in a bowl, add more to achieve a smooth, pourable, yet thick consistency.\n- **Flour Type**: Rye flour is recommended for its fast action, but any grain flour can be used.\n- **Water Quality**: Use dechlorinated water to avoid harming the natural yeasts and bacteria.\n- **Maintenance**: Stir the mixture at least once a day until bubbles appear, then transition to feeding it with a high proportion of fresh flour regularly.\n\n### Advanced Techniques and Variations\n- **Water Variants**: Some people use water from boiling potatoes or starchy water from rinsing grains, fruits, or vegetables.\n- **Additives**: Options include using fruit or vegetable skins, and fermenting beer foams.\n- **Commercial Starters**: Some starters begin with a packet of yeast and evolve, or use starters obtained or bought from others.\n- **Hands-On Approach**: Stirring with clean hands as a means of culturing.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n- **Simplicity**: Fundamentally, the primary requirements for a sourdough starter are just flour and water. The rest of the techniques and additives are optional based on personal preference or specific desired characteristics of the sourdough."

This process helps in restoring flavor lost due to evaporation.\n\n**Types of Tomatoes:**\n- **Ripe Tomatoes:** When allowed to ripen fully on the vine, tomatoes accumulate more sugar, acid, and volatile compounds, enhancing their flavor.\n- **Unripe Tomatoes:** Often picked green and artificially stimulated to redden, leading typically to a less flavorful variety.\n- **Regional Preferences:** Different regions prefer different textures and flavors:\n  - In Europe and Latin America, less fruity, more vegetable-like mature green tomatoes are preferred.\n  - In rural Peru, both tomato and tomatillo are appreciated even when they are frankly bitter.\n\n**Cooked Tomatoes:**\n- When cooked, the tomatoes lose some aromatic qualities but gain flavors from carotenoid pigments and other components.\n- Notably, fresh-tomato leaves are sometimes added towards the end of cooking to reintroduce a fresh-tomato aroma attributed to leaf enzymes and aromatic oil glands.\n\n**Figure Caption:**\n- **Tomato Anatomy Illustration:**\n  - Labels highlighting the jelly, pith, fruit wall, and the rich content of sugars, amino acids, and aroma molecules in the jelly and fruit wall, which are crucial for balancing the acids in tomatoes."

Here's an organized transcription and summary of the content:\n\n### Bitterness and Aroma Hops\n- **Bitterness**: Comes from phenolic \"alpha acids\" in their resins.\n- **Aroma**: Derives from their essential oil. Some hop varieties are particularly valued for these properties.\n- **Alpha acids**: Not very soluble in water, but prolonged boiling during brewing converts them into soluble structures that enhance beer flavor.\n- **Volatile aroma compounds**: Some brewing processes involve adding hops after boiling to retain these aromatic qualities.\n- **Character**: The aroma of typical hops is determined by myrcene (also found in bay leaf and verbena), and is woody and resinous. Noble hops are highlighted by their delicate aroma containing pine and citrus notes from terpenes like humulene and caryophyllene.\n\n### Brewing Beer\n- **Mashing**: Barley malt is soaked in hot water to convert starches into sugars.\n- **Boiling**: Hops are added to the liquid, and the mixture is boiled to extract hop resins, kill microbes, and intensify the beer's flavor.\n- **Fermentation**: Yeasts ferment the sugars to produce alcohol. This step continues until desired alcohol and flavor levels are achieved.\n- **Conditioning**: The new beer is refined, aged, and carbonated.\n- **Details**: Each stage has specific actions that are crucial for the final beer quality.\n\n### Additional\n- An illustration indicates details of the hop vine, Humulus lupulus, focusing on its female flower structure, the cone, particularly highlighting the \"bracts\" or clustered leaves that connect directly to oil glands, critical for imparting aroma and flavor in beer.\n\nThis document provides a concise explanation of how hops contribute to the beer's taste and aroma, as well as a brief overview of the beer brewing process."

Unlike the collagen of fish, cephalopod collagen is extensively cross-linked and resembles that of abalone and other animals. To prevent toughening of the muscle fibers during cooking, they should be cooked briefly or cooked slowly to break down the collagen, softening it to a gelatinous texture.\n- **Cooking Tips**: \n  - Squid and octopus should be cooked briefly to prevent muscle toughening or slow-cooked to dissolve the tougher collagen.\n  - At temperatures around 130–135°F/55–57°C, the flesh is moist and tender.\n  - At 140°F/60°C, the flesh curls and shrinks as collagen layers contract.\n\n### Cephalopod Flavor and Ink\n- **Features**: Cephalopods maintain their osmotic balance with tasteless trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) rather than free amino acids, resulting in a less sweet and more savory flavor compared to other molluscs. This can become fishy when bacteria convert TMAO into trimethylamine (TMA).\n- **Cephalopod Ink**: This ink is a protective pigment that the animal can release when threatened; it contains heat-stable mix of phenolic compounds. Culinary uses include darkening stews and pastas.\n\n### Other Invertebrates: Sea Urchins\n- **Physical Description**: Sea urchins, part of the echinoderms family, have spiny exteriors and are known for their richly flavored reproductive tissues. They are valued for their golden, creamy insides, which account for a significant part of their biomass.\n- **Usage**: \n  - In Japan, they are often eaten raw in sushi or seasoned.\n  - In France, they are used in various cooked dishes including scrambled eggs, soufflés, and soups.\n\n### Preserved Fish\n- **Historical Context**: Before refrigeration and modern transportation, methods like drying, salting, smoking, fermenting, or other combinations of antimicrobial treatments were used for preserving fish.\n- **Current Relevance**: Despite technology that allows for fresh fish, preserved fish continues to be crucial, especially in parts of Europe and Asia, offering not just a means of storage but also distinct flavors and textures.\n\n### Dried Fish\n- **Method**: Drying in the sun and wind was an ancient method of preserving fish, effective at reducing water content below 25% to restrict bacteria and mold growth.\n- **Details**: This method ensures that while fresh fish contains water, lowering water content through sun-drying inhibits bacterial and mold growth, making the fish storable for longer periods."

    "contenu": "## Sauternes and Barsac\n\nQuite a bit south of Graves, along the Garonne River, are Bordeaux’s five sweet-wine-producing communes, the two most important of which are Sauternes and Barsac (the other three are Bommes, Fargues, and Preignac). Sauternes and Barsac are not simply two unique, small places within Bordeaux; they are among the few regions in the world devoted to sweet wines. Sauternes, the more famous of the two, is about four times larger than tiny Barsac, but the wines from each can be extraordinary. At their best, these are wines with an apricotish opulence that detonates in your mouth and then spreads over your taste buds like liquefied honey. The British wine expert Hugh Johnson has described them best. Of one Sauternes, he wrote, “It was glorious in its youth; a creamy, stinging, orange-scented, head-filling quintessence of pourriture noble. It is still awesome: now deep gold and smelling of crème brûlée, but still racily potent and endlessly sweet.”\n\nNeedless to say, it takes merely a sip of a great Sauternes or Barsac to create a convert. The great examples are wonderful not because of their sweetness, however, but because of their extraordinary balance. The best are luscious without being cloying, richly honeyed without tasting like candy. To achieve this, the wines must have just the right acidity and alcohol and must be complex.\n\n### How the Wine is Made\n\nSauternes and Barsac are made mostly from sémillon and, to a lesser extent, sauvignon blanc grapes left on the vine well into the fall, whereupon they usually become infected with the benevolent fungus Botrytis cinerea, also known as pourriture noble or noble rot. Sémillon, the leading grape in the area, is especially susceptible to the fungus because of its large bunches of thin-skinned grapes with a high sugar content.\n\nGraves is the only region of Bordeaux where almost every château produces both a red and a white wine.\n\n### Botrytis and Wine Quality\n\nAlthough it seems unlikely that grapes left to decay into furry, moldy raisins will become magnificent wine, they can. In Sauternes and Barsac the process occurs naturally, though erratically, by virtue of the region’s singular climate. For the botrytis fungus to take hold on healthy, ripe grapes, the region must have just the right amount of humidity and warmth (too little or too much can produce problems). Sauternes and Barsac, the farthest south of all the important regions of Bordeaux, are ideally situated. Here, the Ciron River meets the Garonne River, creating gentle morning mists. If all goes well, nearby forests will help to hold the moisture in the air. When the day warms up and grows drier, a perfect stage is set for botrytis to appear.\n\nAs the beneficial mold punctures the grapes’ skins in search of water to germinate its spores, the water begins to evaporate and the grapes dehydrate. Inside the shriveled berries, the sugar in the juice becomes progressively more concentrated. The botrytis also alters the structure of the grapes’ acids, but the amount of acidity in the wine is not diminished."

Indeed, the first winery in the New World—Casa Madero—was established in 1597 in the Mexican town of Santa Maria de las Parras (“Holy Mary of the Grapevines”), and the winery continues to thrive today.\n\nLike many wine drinkers, I once assumed that most Mexican wine would be cheap, rough-and-ready stuff sold in supermarkets. Admittedly, such wines do exist in Mexico (as they do nearly everywhere else). But beginning in the 1990s, and building on the success of already established wineries like Monte Xanic, Santo Tomás, and L.A. Cetto, a group of creative young winemakers quietly began making small lots of surprisingly delicious wines. Today, Mexico’s rapidly growing fine wine industry is bursting with energy, and the top wines are astonishing in quality.\n\nMexico has some 7,660 acres (3,100 hectares) of vineyards, and wine is produced in three principal areas—in the northwest, specifically in the Baja Peninsula, immediately south of California; in the north central states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua, all just south of Texas and New Mexico; and in the center of Mexico, in the states of Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, and Queretaro. Of these three regions, more than 90 percent of all fine wine is produced in Baja.\n\nThe 1,012-mile-long (1,629-kilometer) Baja Peninsula is divided lengthwise by the mineral-rich Sierra de Baja California mountain range, which effectively divides the climate of the peninsula in half. All of the vineyards lie in arid valleys to the west of these mountains, where the climate is Mediterranean-like and cold air from the Pacific Ocean acts as a giant air conditioner, cooling the grapes. The main valleys extend, from the thriving port city of Ensenada on the Pacific Ocean. (A gastronomically oriented city, Ensenada is famous for its fish tacos, in which Pacific lobster or shark are deep-fried in lard, then wrapped in fluffy, homemade flour tortillas.)"

It is described as being delicate, so it should be added at the end of cooking. It is particularly good on lighter dishes like salads, poached or steamed flaky white fish, poultry, or pork. When using fennel pollen, the aromatic and floral smell is noticeable even before tasting the food, enhancing thoughts of summer and freshness.\n\n**Example Use Case in Cooking:**\nBrad Farmerie, from PUBLIC (New York City), uses fennel pollen in a sea trout dish served with a simple salad of green apple, fennel, jicama, pistachios, and dried gooseberries. The dish is finished with fennel pollen, yogurt, lemon juice, and preserved lemon, enhancing the summer feel, especially when enjoyed with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc on a terrace in the early evening.\n\nIn general, fennel pollen is prized for its ability to add an herbaceous and mysterious flavor to various meats like pork, boar, chicken, and lamb, often used in marinades to impart these distinctive tastes."

    "contenu": "## Wine and Food Pairing\n\n### Ingredients and Styles\n\nSauvignon Blanc is considered one of the best wines to drink with food. Its ability to enhance a meal is praised, particularly when paired with most salads, light poultry, shellfish, and vegetarian dishes notable for bright, tangy flavors like peppers, eggplant, zucchini, asparagus, or leeks. It also beautifully complements most shellfish and simple seafood and fowl dishes. \n\nMeats like pork and veal, when paired with certain preparations that enhance their natural flavors using additions like citrus, capers, garlic, olives, and capers, also work well with Sauvignon Blanc. Dishes such as green salads with goat cheese, pasta with green beans, tomatoes, and garlic, and fish-fried rock fillets are all excellent counterparts.\n\nMoreover, Sauvignon Blanc is notable for handling \"small plates\" or mezze-style dishes, providing balanced accompaniment without overpowering the dishes themselves. Ingredients such as feta, ricotta salata, Fontana, Jarlsberg, and any sheep cheese are recommended.\n\n### Sauvignon Blends\n\nSauvignon blends that incorporate Semillon, Chardonnay, and Viognier adapt well to richer meal preparations like risotto, lightly smoked grilled white meat, fish, and poultry, and also handle fuller body and zippier acidity. They mirror the texture, personality, and main flavors of those dishes, resembling in some ways the strong personality found in aged white wines.\n\n### Aged Sauvignon Blanc\n\nAged Sauvignon Blanc introduces different layers of taste, moving from tangy green and citrus notes to more developed flavors of nut, yellow and green vegetable, and sherry, especially for those with a palate for older wines, which can enhance more robust fish dishes, dishes with strong sauces, and textured vegetarian dishes (e.g., eggplant parmigiana or vegetarian lasagna).\n\n### Methods of Cooking\n\nIn terms of cooking methods, Sauvignon Blanc is versatile with its ability to be paired with low-impact cooking methods which preserve the natural flavors of the ingredients. Its acidity enhances the dishes, especially steamed dishes which can be uplifted by the wine’s characteristics."

The seeds or fruits of these plants may contain chemical defenses, which makes them spicier because they are attractive to insects and birds.\n  \n- **Unique Compounds**: Carrot family plants such as dill, parsley, fennel, and carrots share common aromatic compounds like terpene and myristicin, which contribute to their common woody, warm notes.\n\n**Highlighted Plants in the Carrot Family**:\n1. **Angelica (Angelica archangelica)** - Known for its sweet smell, it was a delicacy in medieval times. It is now used in flavoring gins, liqueurs, candies, perfumes, etc.\n2. **Celery (Apium graveolens)** - It is a thick-stalked vegetable known for its distinct flavor from leaves and stalks containing compounds like phthalides. It pairs well with onions and carrots in cooking.\n3. **Chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium)** - It has small, pale, and finely divided leaves; best used raw or barely warmed as cooking dissipates its tarragon-like flavor. It is used in the French mixture *fines herbes*.\n\n**Herbs of the Carrot Family**:\n- Angelica: Angelica archangelica\n- Celery: Apium graveolens\n- Chervil: Anthriscus cerefolium\n- Coriander leaf: Coriandrum sativum\n- Dill: Anethum graveolens\n- Fennel: Foeniculum vulgare\n- Lovage: Levisticum officinale\n- Mitsuba: Cryptotaenia japonica\n- Parsley: Petroselinum crispum\n- Saw-leaf herb: Eryngium foetidum\n\nThis structured content layout provides a concise overview of the key points described in the document, focusing on the uniqueness and applications of the carrot family plants in culinary and aromatic contexts."

Below is a structured representation of the pairing tables from the document:\n\n### Classic Pairings\n\n- **Ibérico Ham and Fino Sherry**\n  - Description: Low acidity and sometimes bitter edge of Fino sherry make for an appealing contrast with the slight sweetness of the fat running through Ibérico ham. A classic combination in Spain, these two ingredients share roasted, fruity, and cheesy notes.\n\n- **Ibérico Ham and Roasted Peanut**\n  - Description: The different flavors of nuts are mostly due to Maillard-derived pyrazines that form during the roasting process. Peanuts contain the nutty-flavored 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methoxy-5-methylpyrazine, which provide an aromatic link to Ibérico ham. These ingredients also share green, citrus and fruity notes.\n\n### Ingredient Pairing Tables\n\nBelow is a representation of some pairings depicted in the document (example from the \"Fino sherry\" section):\n\n#### Fino Sherry\n| Ingredient          | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| apricot             | O |   |   |   |   |\n| Emmental            |   | O |   |   |   |\n| pan-fried chicken breast |   |   | O | O | O |\n| pear wood smoke     |   | O | O |   |   |\n| ají amarillo chili  |   |   |   | O |   |\n| mil choocolate       |   |   | O |   |   |\n\n(Note: Circle sizes represent affinity strength. Here, \"O\" represents the circle.)\n\nThis pattern continues with other pairings like roasted peanuts, rooibos tea, spearmint oil, shōchū (komejōchū), and sage. Each row lists an ingredient and columns show the flavor relationship strength (0-6, with 6 being strong) between the Ibérico ham and paired ingredient based on different nuances like fruitiness, fat dampening, greenness, etc.\n\nThis structured representation offers insight into the gastronomic complexities and potential for creating harmonious combinations in culinary practices involving Ibérico ham."

Here are the main points covered in the document structured by their respective headings:\n\n### FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE\n- **Fish and seafood**: Fish and shellfish are distinguished as special kinds of food which are sourced from the wild. Despite the difficulties in harvesting and preparing them due to their variability, they offer an opportunity to discover new ingredients and pleasures.\n  \n- **History of fisheries**: The text recounts the historical development of fishing, attributing qualities such as human ingenuity, bravery, and a history of wastefulness to the exploitations of the oceans' resources. According to T.H. Huxley in 1883, despite the vastness of fisheries like the cod, herring, pilchard, and mackerel, modern times see a degradation in their populations.\n  \n- **Current state of wild fish stocks**: It is mentioned that many fish populations, such as cod and herring, are in decline on both sides of the North Atlantic. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that two-thirds of the major commercial fish are overharvested.\n  \n### MODERN FISHING AND ITS IMPACTS\n- **Sustainability concerns**: Modern fishing methods are criticized for depleting fish populations and causing collateral damage to other marine species and habitats, often due to indiscriminate nets and bycatch.\n\n- **Aquaculture**: As a modern alternative, aquaculture, or fish farming, is noted. It has vastly expanded over thousands of years to become highly productive. Currently, it is practiced globally and involves species such as rainbow trout, catfish, and salmon across various continents and setups, from family farms to offshore pens. It's highlighted that about 70 aquatic species are now farmed worldwide.\n\n### ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS OF AQUACULTURE\n- **Advantages**: The primary benefits of aquaculture include providing a controlled environment that mitigates some of the uncertainties of wild fisheries, enhancing food security, and potentially maintaining more sustainable fish populations.\n\n### THE OCEANS' SILVER STREAMS\n- This section includes a historical quote from Capt. John Smith in 1624, illustrating the high value and challenging nature of fishing near New England and the Summer Isles, and describing the abundance and economic importance of fish in these regions.\n\nOverall, the document gives a comprehensive view of the challenges and transitions within the fisheries and aquaculture industries."

Is there a rich component, a lean component, a crunchy component, and a cleansing component? Are all the taste sensors activated so that you want to go back for a second bite? Cod works better over a richer preparation like chowder. I would also make sure to choose the right technique for the cod: I would not poach it, because if it is poached it would be silky on silky. If it is seared, it is crunchy on silky — which is more appealing because of the contrast.\n— **SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)**\n\nA food’s texture is central to its ability to captivate and to please.

Some of the unique chemical components found in mushrooms such as shiitakes, matsutakes, and others have been shown to potentially inhibit tumor growth as well as limit the production of mutagenic nitrosamines in our digestive systems.\n\n### The Distinctive Flavors of Mushrooms\nMushrooms like shiitake are prized for their rich, meaty flavor and the ability to enhance flavors in various dishes. This is largely due to:\n- High content of **free amino acids** including glutamic acid.\n- Presence of **natural enhancers** like monosodium glutamate (naturally occurring in mushrooms).\n- A compound called **GMP (guanosine monophosphate)** that enhances flavors.\n\nThe characteristic aroma of mushrooms, particularly noted in freshly cut mushrooms, is due to **octenol** — an 8-carbon alcohol. This compound is generated more in mature mushrooms with prominent gills. Other mushrooms provide a variety of aromas, such as almond extract from more exotic species, and complex flavors like cinnamon, pepper, garlic, pine needles, butterscotch, and shellfish, particularly noted in shiitake mushrooms owing to a distinct molecule.\n\n### Storage and Handling\nMushrooms should be stored at cool temperatures ideally at **40–45°F/4–6°C** to slow down metabolism, which involves:\n- Reducing moisture loss by wrapping mushrooms in moisture-absorbing packaging.\n- Quick usage post-harvest to prevent spoilage and enhance flavor.\n\nIt is advised against washing mushrooms too often as it might dilute their flavor. A brief rinse is sufficient; they must be cooked immediately afterward to preserve their flavor and texture.\n```\n\nThis summarized content reflects key points about the use, benefits, and handling of mushrooms as discussed in the provided document."

Perhaps more surprising is the idea that Texas may have been one of the earliest places in the United States to produce wine. Historians theorize that Franciscan priests planted vineyards possibly as early as 1660, at missions in what is now far west Texas. Today, winemaking continues in the Lone Star State, and it’s definitely not cowboy juice.\n\nTexas is the largest of the forty-eight contiguous states. In landmass, it is bigger than France, although all of the vineyard acreage in the state, some 3,500 acres (1,400 hectares), could easily fit into the confines of the small French appellation of Sancerre. There are three broad grape-growing areas—the Texas Hill Country, the High Plains, and the vast Trans-Pecos region (more on all to follow). Within each region, wineries are not grouped closely together but scattered across hundreds of miles/kilometers of differing mesoclimates and terrains. Neighboring wineries are often more than an hour’s drive apart.\n\nAs was true in California, the first grapes planted in Texas were mission grapes, a Spanish variety (known in Spain as listán prieto) that was the same as Chile’s país grape, and that was one of the parents of Argentina’s criolla grape. However serviceable mission wine might have been, it was only that—serviceable. By the nineteenth century, as new immigrants from Germany, Italy, and France came to Texas, they brought more European grape varieties. Generally, the vines succumbed to the severities of the climate and disease. Texas’s immigrant winemakers were undeterred. When their new European vines failed, they made wine from native Texas grapes, including one called, appropriately enough, mustang."

This process splits into two parts: curds and whey (petit lait).\n    \n- **Rompage:** This is a process that transforms the curds into a fine mash, improving the draining process.\n\n- **Égouttage:** The operation separates the curd from the whey. Draining can happen spontaneously through simple filtration or accelerated by stirring, hacking or heating.\n\n- **Moulage:** A step where the future cheese takes its final shape, using either perforated molds or wrapping in cloth bound by wood or other materials.\n\n- **Salage:** Salt is applied on the surface or within the cheese paste. The methods and products vary by cheese type, playing a crucial role in flavor and crust development as it promotes micro-organism development and moisture exchange inside and outside the cheese paste.\n\n- **Affinage:** A maturation period in humid and cool cellars where manual care (brushing, washing, turning, and poking) is applied to modify the taste and achieve a beautiful rind.\n\n### **2/ LA CLASSIFICATION DES FROMAGES FRANÇAIS**\n\n---\n\n#### Categories and Types of French Cheeses:\n1. **Fromages à pâte molle, croûte fleurie** \n   - (Soft cheeses with a bloomy rind)\n\n2. **Fromages à pâte molle, croûte lavée**\n   - (Soft cheeses with a washed rind)\n\n3. **Fromages à pâte persillée**\n   - (Blue cheeses, i.e., cheeses with veins)\n\n4. **Fromages à pâte pressée non cuite**\n   - (Uncooked pressed cheeses)\n\n5. **Fromages à pâte pressée cuite**\n   - (Cooked pressed cheeses)\n\n6. **Fromages à pâte molle croûte naturelle (chèvres)**\n   - (Soft cheeses with a natural rind — typically goat cheeses)\n\n7. **Fromages à pâte fraîche**\n   - (Fresh cheeses)\n\n8. **Fromages à pâte fraîche filée**\n   - (Fresh, spun cheeses)\n\n9. **Fromages fondus**\n   - (Processed cheeses)\n\nThese sections detail from the initial ingredients and methods used in producing cheeses to a detailed classification based on texture and processing techniques specific to French cheese culture."

Here’s a structured breakdown of its contents:\n\n### Slide Title \n**1.3 Les 6 familles de vins de Bordeaux**\n\n### Content Overview\n- During the 1960s, Bordeaux white wines played a prominent role. The large frost of 1956 and the significant boom of red wine between 1991 and led many winemakers to switch to white wine production.\n- With about 10,000 hectares, dry white wines now represent 8% of the total wine production.\n\n### Specific Details\n- Dry white wines are noted for requiring **particular care** and **significant expertise**. \n- Winemakers have specialized in this segment, selecting the finest terroirs for the main white grape varieties, **Sauvignon**, **Sémillon**, and **Muscadelle**.\n- They use ultramodern equipment and techniques like thermostatic controls and pneumatic presses, which are just a few examples of technical progress.\n- **Professor Denis Dubourdieu** symbolizes this exemplary quality of Bordeaux white wines. His scientific research at the Faculty of Oenology at the University of Bordeaux has significantly contributed to establishing new global standards in the vinification of these wines.\n - He heavily emphasized the beneficial effects of pre-fermentation **pellicular maceration** which enhances the structure and expression of the wine’s aromas. These techniques provide the white wines not only vibrancy and freshness but also richer aromatic qualities, that are highly appreciated today in Bordeaux.\n\n### Visuals\n1. An image captioned \"Dry white wines – freshness and elegance\" featuring a wine bottle with a vineyard in the background.\n2. A small embedded map showing the wine-producing regions in Bordeaux.\n\n### Footer\n**Slides 23 and 24:**\n- Focus on Dry white wines\n\nThis structured outline distils the primary focus of the slide, emphasizing both the historical context and the contemporary practices in winemaking associated with the Bordeaux dry white wines."

Pungency is rated in Scoville units, a measure invented around 1912 by pharmaceutical chemist Wilbur Scoville and later adapted to modern chemical analyses. The original method involved an overnight alcohol extraction of the pepper, and then a tasting of increasing dilutions of the extract until the pungency is barely detectable. The more the extract can be diluted, the more pungent it is, and the higher the Scoville score.\n\n#### Chili Variety\n\n**Capsicum annuum**\n- **Bell**: 0–600\n- **New Mexican**: 500–2,500\n- **Wax**: 0–40,000\n- **Paprika**: 0–2,500\n- **Pimiento**: 0\n- **Jalapeno**: 2,500–10,000\n- **Ancho/ poblano**: 1,000–1,500\n- **Serrano**: 10,000–25,000\n- **Cayenne**: 30,000–50,000\n\n**Capsicum chinense**\n- **Habanero, scotch bonnet**: 80,000–150,000\n\n**Capsicum frutescens**\n- **Tabasco**: 30,000–50,000\n\n**Capsicum pubescens**\n- **Rocoto**: 30,000–60,000\n\n**Capsicum baccatum**\n- **Aji**: 30,000–50,000\n\nThis table gives an understanding of the varying levels of heat produced by these different types of chili peppers, each belonging to distinct species within the Capsicum genus."

Here is the content structured sequentially:\n\n1. **Pouring Liquid into Jigger**:\n   - Keep the tip of the speed pourer or bottle as close to the jigger's lip as possible.\n   - If using a speed pourer, the liquid flows faster as the bottle is raised.\n   - Start pouring at a high angle, then taper down to slow the flow for precision and control.\n\n2. **Filling the Jigger**:\n   - Fill the jigger completely to ensure the correct measurement.\n   - Overfilling or underfilling can alter the drink's flavor and consistency.\n   - Check the meniscus, ensuring it is flat: convex indicates overfilling, concave indicates underfilling.\n   - It's sometimes necessary to add a little extra liquid to account for ingredient density variations.\n\n3. **Using a Speed Pourer**:\n   - Turn your wrist towards your body to stop the liquid flow.\n\n4. **Transferring Liquid to Glass**:\n   - Tilt the jigger towards your body while pouring into the glass; this prevents spillover to the external side of the glass. \n\nEach of these steps includes tips for maintaining control over the pour, which ensures accuracy in drink mixing, focusing especially on the nuances of using a speed pourer and managing the meniscus in the jigger."

Here is the structured summary of the content:\n\n### Pairing Suggestions for Pinot Noir\n\n**Pairing well with Pinot Noir:**\n- **Vegetables and Earthier Flavors:**\n  - Especially when serving an earthier-style bottle, Pinot Noir pairs well with cooked greens, squash, fennel, lentils, onion, garlic, cooked brown mushrooms, and Dijon mustard.\n- **Multiple Asian Cuisines:**\n  - Matches well with Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Singaporean, and Korean foods that feature sweet-salt flavor combinations and texture. Suitable dishes include Peking duck, tea-smoked or tandoori chicken, or Hoisin- and soy-glazed pork roast.\n- **Room-temperature Cold Cuts:**\n  - Complements mild cheeses, charcuterie, sliced ham or turkey, enhancing their flavors when enjoyed with Pinot Noir. It works well as a picnic wine, especially if slightly chilled.\n\n**Pairing suggestions to avoid with Pinot Noir:**\n- **Strong Seafood and Fish:**\n  - It is recommended to avoid mussels, sea bass, anchovies, sardines, and mackerel as the wine is too delicate for these strong flavors.\n- **Dishes with Rich Sauces:**\n  - Overly creamy, buttery, and thick mayonnaise-based sauces overpower the subtlety of Pinot Noir.\n- **Very Spicy Food:**\n  - Dishes that are very hot can burn out the nuanced flavor of Pinot Noir.\n- **Strong-flavored Cheeses:**\n  - While Pinot Noir can work with milder creamy cheeses like Teleme, Taleggio, Brie, strong-flavored cheeses might drown out the wine’s delicate flavors, though experimentation is encouraged.\n\nThis guidance helps in enhancing the dining experience by carefully selecting food that complements the flavor profile of Pinot Noir."

    "contenu": "The provided document discusses the complex interdependence between humans and microorganisms, particularly focusing on humans' relationship with various microbes, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Vitis vinifera (grapes), and Hordeum vulgare (barley). It emphasizes that rather than viewing humans as masters of microorganisms, it's more accurate to consider a mutual relationship where both benefit and influence each other.\n\n### Document Analysis:\n\n1. **Introduction of Concept**:\n   - The text starts by opposing the view of humans as the \"masters\" of microorganisms, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example to argue that these organisms are not merely servants but participants in a mutual relationship. This is similarly compared to the relationship with plants like grapes and barley.\n\n2. **Role of Lactic Acid Bacteria**:\n   - The text then shifts focus to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), stating that every person hosts these bacteria from birth and that they are ubiquitous, involved in various ecological niches. These niches range from food products to human bodily regions such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. It underscores the genetic adaptability of LABs, allowing them to thrive in diverse environments, thus suggesting a co-evolutionary relationship with humans.\n\n3. **Genetic Adaptation and Human Influence**:\n   - A significant point made in the document is the specialized adaptation of LABs through gene shedding for unused metabolic pathways when adapting to nutrient-rich environments such as milk. This is said to emerge not just from natural evolution, but significantly through human-created environments, highlighting anthropogenic influences on microbial evolution.\n\n4. **Philosophical Reflection**:\n   - The document ends with a reflection on the perceived servant-master relationship between humans and microorganisms. It questions who benefits from whom and suggests abandoning hierarchical views to recognize a mutually interdependent relationship, wherein humans and microbes are both part of complex biological feedback loops contributing to evolutionary narratives.\n\nOverall, the document stresses the importance of recognizing the reciprocal nature of our relationship with microorganisms, advocating for a viewpoint that sees humans and microbes as co-participants in ecological and evolutionary processes rather than a simple hierarchical relationship."

Here is a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### PAIRING WITH FOOD\n- **Introduction**: The text opens by noting that Roussanne wine is often compared to Viognier for its food-friendliness, which is sometimes underrated. Roussanne is described as being rich, silky, and balanced, with a panoply of unique flavors.\n- **Flavor Compatibility**: \n  - It is recommended with exotic dishes, including those from North African tagines to dishes seasoned with cumin and ginger. \n  - The flavors are best with less exuberant and rich textures of food.\n  \n- **Food Matches**:\n  - **Vegetables**: Works well with slow-cooked root vegetables like parsnips and carrots, rich cream- and butter-infused pastas, and grains like risotto and polenta.\n  - **Nuts**: Particularly complements oily nuts like macadamias and cashews.\n  - **Meats**: Ideal with rich preparations of fish and white meats, such as veal.\n  \n- **Wine Attributes**:\n  - Noted especially for matching well with rich shellfish, crab, and lobster due to its texture and ripe fruit flavors which align well with crab cakes better than it does with tuna.\n\n### PAIRING POINTERS\n- **Flavor Profile**:\n  - Roussanne is described as mouthfilling but not overly acidic, providing a refreshing change from the typical Chardonnay. It has a texture that appeals to Chardonnay loyalists.\n- **Food Suggestions**:\n  - **Vegetables**: Excellent with rich-textured root vegetables, tubers, and winter squashes such as yams, roasted turnips, and dishes involving tapioca.\n  - **Special Dishes**: Complements traditional holiday foods like goose, turkey, and honey-glazed ham; dishes with many seasonings like cloves, pineapple, and cherries.\n  - **Purées**: Pairs well with rich, unctuous purées made with cream or butter.\n  - **International Cuisine**: Versatile with dishes ranging from Thai curries, Indonesian satays, Jamaican jerk chicken, to North African dishes involving chicken with apricots and almonds.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Complementary Wines**: Mentions that blends that contain Marsanne are particularly good with Roussanne because Marsanne adds body (described as \"baby fat\") to the wine's texture.\n\nThis structure highlights the versatility and recommended food pairings of Roussanne wine, emphasizing its compatibility with a variety of dishes and its distinct flavor profile as compared to more common white wines like Chardonnay."

Notably, each winery must derive at least 75% of its revenue from the actual sale of wine. Revenue from other merchandise like baseball caps, jams, or aprons does not count towards this percentage.\n   - There is a legal stipulation regarding the ratio of land to wine production: a winery producing between 50,000 to 150,000 gallons (or 1,900 to 5,700 hectoliters) of wine must possess at least 40 acres (about 16 hectares) of land. This requirement ensures that operations are genuinely agricultural and not merely residential or 'lifestyle' ventures, thus excluding \"lifestyle vineyards\" from being classified as true working wineries under these regulations. \n\nThis encapsulation of the document highlights both the economic aspects and regulatory environment surrounding vineyards and wineries in the area, emphasizing a commitment to preservation of agricultural practices and land use over commercial or recreational uses."

Thinking regionally is as important to good pairing as thinking seasonally is to good cooking. Many people are familiar with the maxim “If it grows together, it goes together,” and this is still the best place to start as a guide. Knowing what country you want to draw on will narrow your list of ingredient choices, often for the better! For example, as chicken is the world traveler of ingredients, if you’re making a chicken dish, you’ll especially need to decide on a region of inspiration. Are you going to root your dish in Mexico by topping it with salsa, or take it to France by finishing it with a mustard cream sauce? The accompaniments you choose will reinforce the dish’s sense of place. Would rice and beans, or boiled new potatoes, be most appealing served alongside it?"

During fermentation sugar is consumed by microorganisms called yeasts and converted into alcohol. Because yeasts are everywhere, fermentation happens all the time throughout nature. Anything sugary can ferment; in fact, it’s an early phase of spoilage. Have you ever taken a trip and forgotten to clean out the fridge first? If the orange juice tasted sour and fizzy when you came home, congratulations: You made orange wine.\n\nThere is no need to master chemical formulas to appreciate wine. But if you want to get a handle on how the wine world works, a basic grasp of fermentation is a good place to start.\n\n- **IN WINEMAKING, THE MAIN PROCESS THAT OCCURS IS FERMENTATION, IN WHICH YEASTS CONSUME SUGAR AND GENERATE ALCOHOL.**\n\nAny sweet liquid can ferment, and all beverage alcohol is made via fermentation. Beer and sake are fermented beverages too, but they are based on malted barley and moldy rice instead of ripe grapes. When yeasts metabolize sugar, they break it down into alcohol and\n\n---\n\n### ED SBRAGIA\n#### is one of California’s most respected winemakers. He holds the title of winemaster emeritus at Napa Valley’s Beringer Vineyards in honor of his 32-year tenure at California’s oldest continuously operating winery. His wines have garnered countless awards, and he was instrumental in developing Beringer’s legendary Private Reserve program. Although Sbragia continues to consult for Beringer, he has recently focused on his own family’s vineyard land in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek valley.

Fisher lived in the Sonoma Valley for much of her life.\n\n2. **Description of Sonoma's Climate:**\n   - Detailing how Sonoma's regional climate is unique due to the patterns of fog and sunshine. These climatic features contribute to the local viticulture, emphasizing the pendulum-like climate of warm days and cool nights. This scenario is advantageous for grape growth, allowing grapes to mature evenly and fully.\n\n### Image Description:\n\n- **Caption:** Northwestern face of Camp Meeting Ridge—a chardonnay vineyard at 1,200 feet (400 meters) in the appellation known as the Sonoma Coast. The vineyard belongs to Flowers Vineyard and Winery, one of the early pioneers of the appellation which, as the name implies, is strung out along Sonoma's Pacific coast.\n- **Content:** The image shows a chardonnay vineyard, notably elevated, demonstrating the typical hilly and dense pattern of vine plantings typical to premium vineyard locations aimed at optimal sun exposure and airflow.\n\nThis document is clearly oriented towards highlighting the link between climatic conditions and wine production quality in Sonoma, underpinned by a literary quote that relates personal sensory experience to the region's offerings."

    "contenu": "## Overview of the Wine Journeys\n\nThe heart of this book is a sequence of journeys through twelve varietals (grape types), along with sparkling wines and dessert wines. Hundreds of grape varieties are used to make wine around the globe. In these sections, I focus on the grapes used to make the wines people most often consume on a regular basis, in still, sparkling, and sweet or dessert styles. Within the categories of white and red, the varietals are arranged in order of popularity and prestige in the wine world. Each journey presents a practical approach to understanding wines made from the grape type, interpreting varied styles, and applying those insights to pairing the wines with food. But first, here's an explanation of the itinerary for each journey and how to follow the road map!\n\n### Wine-Growing Areas\nFirst, I look at the countries, regions, states, appellations, and subappellations where the grape is grown and wines are produced. Tables showing the wine-growing areas for each varietal can be found in the chapter titled **\"Principal Wine-Growing Regions.\"** These tables list U.S. regions first, followed by other areas in order of importance. These lists aren’t exhaustive; they emphasize what is commercially produced and widely available.\n\n### Vintner Choices\nThis section lists the fundamental options and decisions facing a winemaker and his or her team that determine the style, taste, and flavor of the wine. Many of these choices are addressed as comparative scenarios, such as the use of oak or no oak, blended or 100 percent pure varietal, or barrel rather than stainless-steel fermentation. For sparkling wines and dessert wines, I also explain how these types of wines may be vinified. Definitions of the more technical and specialized terms used in these descriptions are provided in the glossary at the back of the book.\n\nAs this is not an encyclopedic wine book but one about matching food with wine, I don't go into detail about most aspects of wine production. For example, long before the grapes are harvested, vineyard decisions must be made about trellising, irrigation, root-stock selection, leaf picking, and other basic viticultural practices. For more detail on these matters, you may want to check the visual encyclopedic sections of the book."

Here is the structured breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n**Picolit (from piccolo, \"small\" in Italian)**\n- **Existence and Uniqueness:**\n  - The Picolit grape variety likely shouldn't exist due to a genetic mutation causing it to spontaneously abort its flowers. The tiny size of its clusters is suggestive of its name.\n  - Despite the challenges in their formation, less than half of Picolit's flowers survive to become pollinated and evolve into grapes.\n- **Wine Description:**\n  - Very expensive due to its rarity and cultivation challenges.\n  - Known for a delicate honeyed flavor.\n  - Notable producers include Livio Felluga, Ronchi di Cialla, and Dorigo.\n- **Historical Significance:**\n  - One of the first internationally successful wines from Friuli.\n  - Served in handmade Murano glass and was popular among European nobility in the eighteenth century.\n\n**Travel Advice: When you visit Friuli-Venezia Giulia**\n- **Wineries:**\n  - Located in Collio and Colli Orientali districts which are described as easily accessible from Trieste.\n  - The area is known for its significant wine production, with notable local towns like the wine town of Udine featuring Venetian Renaissance-style architecture.\n- **Special Notes:**\n  - Trieste is notable for the presence of the Illy coffee headquarters, enhancing its appeal to coffee enthusiasts.\n  - Day trips for wine lovers are advisable, but appointments are necessary for visiting wineries."

Produces fresh, lively whites reminiscent of famous albariños of northwest Spain.\n\n**Chardonnay**\n- Description: Most widely planted white grape. Known for producing wines that range from bland to extraordinary. Best varieties come from cool areas, crafted by winemakers who prioritize balance over oak.\n\n**Chenin Blanc**\n- Description: Used historically for jug wines. It’s capable of producing very tasty wines, although plantings are in decline.\n\n**French Colombard**\n- Description: Planted in less-than-ideal locations and often in high yields for jug wines.\n\n**Gewürztraminer**\n- Description: A minor grape in production, yet produces surprisingly delicious wines, leaving many questioning why it isn’t planted more.\n\n**Marsanne**\n- Description: A minor grape in terms of production. Produces good, simple wines on its own and is a leading component in white Rhône-style blends.\n\n**Muscats (MUSCAT CANELLI, BLACK MUSCAT, AND ORANGE MUSCAT)**\n- Description: Varieties include Muscat Canelli, Black Muscat, and Orange Muscat, all primarily used for semisweet and sweet wines, with Muscat blanc à petits grains being the most frequently used, made into dry wines as well in California.\n\n**Pinot gris**\n- Description: Also known in California by its Italian name, pinot grigio. Converted to light, quaffing wines or stable wines.\n\n**Riesling**\n- Description: California rieslings are less impressive compared to those in the Old World or even places like Australia and Washington State. Some late-harvest versions are very successful.\n\n**Roussanne**\n- Description: Minor in production but prized for its elegance and aroma. Often blended with marsanne in white Rhône-style blends.\n\n**Sauvignon Blanc**\n- Description: Produces simple dry wines, snappy and citrusy. It's also used for more complex Bordeaux-style whites and botrytized dessert wines, sometimes in combination with sémillon.\n\n**Sémillon**\n- Description: Despite being a minor grape in terms of production, it’s noted for high quality. Used primarily for blending with sauvignon blanc for Bordeaux-style dry wines and for botrytized dessert wines.\n\n**Viognier**\n- Description: The leading white Rhône variety. Produces opulent, rich, full-bodied whites that evoke flavors of honeysuckle and melons. Recent increase in plantings since mid-1990s."

Végétalien**\n   - **Definition:** No consumption of any animal products including meat, dairy, eggs, or any products derived from animals (like gelatine).\n   - **Additional Info:** The term 'végétalien' has been included in \"Le Petit Larousse\" since 1989.\n\n**3. Vegan**\n   - **Definition:** Excludes all forms of animal exploitation for food, not only meat and dairy but also excluding animal-derived materials like hair or bone.\n   - **Philosophy:** Ensures the exclusion of all products derived from animals.\n\n**4. Flexitarian**\n   - **Definition:** Primarily vegetarian but occasionally consumes meat.\n   - **Additional Info:** Increasingly recognized, especially in demographics and dietary choice surveys.\n\n### Additional Insights on Vegetarian Demographics\n- It is challenging to precisely determine the percentage of vegetarians within populations, however:\n  - As of the data, approximately 4% in France, 6% in England and Italy, and between 2% to 4% in the rest of Europe are estimated to be vegetarians.\n  - North American estimates are around 10%.\n  - Brazil shows vegetarians making up 6% to 10% of its population, also acknowledging historic vegetarian communities like the Rastafarians.\n\nThis document provides an overview of how vegetarian-based diets are categorized and understood, differing significantly across cultures and historical contexts."

Chefs bring their own unique approaches to their cuisines, which are arguably rooted in either the physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual realms—although they can span two, three, or even all of them.\n\n**Physical Realm Chefs:**\n- **Alice Waters** of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, focuses on the quality of ingredients sourced and served.\n- **Dan Barber** of Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York, utilizes an on-premises greenhouse, gardens, and pastures to raise much of what the restaurant serves.\n\n**Emotional Realm Chefs:**\n- **Rick Bayless** of Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago elevates Mexican cuisine and Vikram Vij and Meeru Dhalwala of Vij’s and Rangoli restaurants in Vancouver celebrate the cooking of India and tap Indian women exclusively to staff their kitchens.\n\n**Mental Realm Chefs:**\n- **Grant Achatz** of Alinea changes how food is conceptualized and presented, with dishes such as a floating balloon of taffy.\n- **Homaro Cantu** of Moto creates dishes incorporating edible paper printed with soy-based inks and doughnut soup.\n\n**Spiritual Realm Chefs:**\n- **Daniel Boulud** of New York’s Restaurant Daniel and **Patrick O’Connell** of The Inn at Little Washington in Virginia transcend the prior three categories by enhancing the dining experience to a spiritual level.\n\n**Reflections from Chefs:**\n- **Vitaly Paley** of Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon: \"My motto has always been: Find the best ingredients possible, and listen to what they tell you about how they want to be prepared. Mess with them as little as you can. Keep their integrity, but at the same time, focus their flavor, which is where creativity comes in.\"\n- General insight: The best chefs work with the best ingredients available and continuously seek to improve by sourcing even better ingredients.\n\n*For further thoughts and explorations into these realms, the document mentions a book titled \"Culinary Artistry\".*"

Fret not: you can still make excellent drinks when faced with these subpar halftones. If you're making a shaken drink, pack the shaker full of ice and shake hard but briefly—about five seconds. This will quickly chill the drink without over-diluting it. If stirring a cocktail, fill the mixing vessel with ice and strain out any water before adding the cocktail ingredients. Be aware that the ice will melt rather quickly, so stir briskly but for less time than usual.\n\n---\n\nNo specific structure such as tables, lists, or bullet points is used in the text segment provided. The recommendation offered is practical advice on how to efficiently use low-quality ice for mixing drinks, either by shaking or stirring, to prevent excessive dilution due to rapid melting."

Located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Paso Robles, both areas are close to the sea and profoundly influenced by its cool, damp breezes. These coastal effects temper Edna Valley’s climate enough to create one of the longest growing seasons of any wine region in California. Arroyo Grande is even cooler, being blanketed in fog for most of the day (which begins to explain why pinot noir thrives here).\n\nEdna Valley was one of the first areas where Spanish missionaries planted the mission grape, but the region lay neglected for centuries until the Goss family planted vineyards in 1973, and started Chamisal Vineyards. Arroyo Grande was similarly brought out of obscurity in the second half of the twentieth century, thanks to Maison Deutz, the California subsidiary of the Champagne house Deutz, which purchased land in Arroyo Grande in 1982, but sadly no longer makes wine there.\n\nToday, the most well-known pinot noirs (and they are sensational) are from Chamisal and Laetitia, and the best chardonnays are made by Edna Valley Vineyards and Talley Vineyards. In addition, using grapes from Edna Valley, tiny Alban Vineyards makes one of the most sensual viogniers in California.\n\n#### Climatic Influence on Wine Quality\n\nThe significant variation between hot daytime and nighttime temperatures, often as great as 50°F (28°C), saves the best wines from being simply overripe and overcrowded. In addition, many of the top wines are the result of vines planted in calcareous clays (limestones), which, in particular, can be found on the west side of Paso Robles, closer toward the ocean.\n\n#### Regional Division for Diversity\n\nFor years, the top wineries of Paso Robles felt that the region needed to be divided into smaller AVAs that would reflect the overall region’s diversity. In 2014, that’s exactly what happened. The Bureau of Tax and Trade approved the largest appellation proposal in U.S. history and established eleven new appellations within Paso Robles: Adelaida District, Creston District, El Pomar District, Paso Robles Estrella District, Paso Robles Geneseo District, Paso Robles Highlands District, Paso Robles Willow Creek District, San Juan Creek, San Miguel District, Santa Margarita Ranch, and the Templeton Gap District. It will undoubtedly be many years before the distinctive characteristics of the wines from these AVAs are known.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the Edna Valley and Arroyo Grande wine regions, focusing on their geographic features, historical development, notable vineyards, and the unique climatic conditions that contribute to their distinct wine profiles. Additionally, it touches on the broader regional organization into AVAs to capture the diverse character of the area’s wine production."

Situation et caractéristiques viticoles de la région**\n\n- **Historique de la vigne en Isère**\n  \n  La viticulture dans la partie nord-ouest autour de Vienne remonte à la Gaule Antique (André & Levadoux, 1964). Elle est l'une des principales agricultures au milieu du XIXème siècle dans la province du Dauphiné qui comptait 33000 hectares en 1850 (Granger, 2020). Mais la région n’a pas échappé à la crise phylloxérique de 1880 faisant chuter les surfaces cultivées. Aujourd'hui, l'activité viticole a repris en Isère, marquée par l'installation successive de jeunes vignerons. Au début du XXIème siècle pour une surface actuelle totale de 300 hectares (France AgriMer, 2020). La production en 2009 est de 3000 hL dont 65% des volumes sont en blanc (Granger, 2020). 10 ans plus tard, la production a été multipliée par 4 avec 2000 hL vinifiés en rouge, 1000 en rosé et 9000 en blanc (toutes dénominations confondues). Ainsi en 2019 en Isère, la production de vin correspond à 15% de ce que produit la Savoie et 0,6% de la production régionale en hectolitres (France AgriMer, 2020).\n  \n  Le secteur se caractérise par des entreprises de petite taille impulsées par les dynamiques environnementales, économiques et sociales actuelles. Deux tiers des exploitations sur les départements Ain, Isère, Savoie et Haute Savoie sont des exploitations individuelles et deux tiers travaillent avec moins de 5 hectares de vignes. Or « Dans l’Ain et en Isère, la prépondérance de ces petites structures est encore plus marquée » (Froissart et al., 2016).\n  \n  L’approche de la culture est raisonnée, en Agriculture Biologique (22% des surfaces d’ADA Bio, 2017) ou en biodynamie. Les marchés de circuit-courts sont privilégiés. Le vignoble s’insère entre ceux de Savoie au Nord-Est et les Côtes du Rhône Septentrionales au Sud-Ouest (figure 1). De part cette situation géographique, la vallée fruit l'encépagement de ses voisins : le Gamay du vignoble mâconnais, le Viognier et la Syrah de la vallée du Rhône, la Jacquère et la Mondeuse de Savoie. Pourtant, la zone comporte historiquement des cépages endémiques alpins, dont la volonté de réimplantation et de promotion est portée par les viticulteurs locaux. Une reconnaissance de la tradition viticole dans la région est appuyée par la création de l’Indication Géographique Protégée «Isère » en 2011, suite une trentaine d’années suite à la reconnaissance des vins de Savoie et Haute-Savoie par l’INAO en 1976. Dans ce cadre, la filière est accompagnée par le Syndicat des Vins d’Isère créé en 1900 dont le rôle est la défense, protection et la valorisation de l’appellation viticole IGP Isère. Il assure un contrôle interne de qualité des vins quand contrôle externe est assuré par l’organisme privé Qualisud.structures de conseil et d’accompagnement viticoles sont dans le département à Chambre d’Agriculture de Grenoble et des réseaux associatifs tels que le GAB FRAB AuRA2 membre de la FNAB. Les structures de conseil oenologique se positionnent à la limite entre Savoie et Isère. De plus, la Savoie compte une trentaine de pépiniéristes et une douzaine fabricants de matériel vinicole se répartissent sur les départements Savoie, Haute-Savoie, Isère et Ain. Le segment de commercialisation des vins prend également une ampleur considérable puisqu’il représente un tiers de l’activité salariale de la filière dans ces départements. Ceci est la conséquence d’une part majeure de commercialisation au détail (Froissart et al., 2016)."

Here's an analysis and structuring of its main content:\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of Fermentation\n\n- **Dominance Over Other Microorganisms**: Fermentation allows the organisms that are being cultivated to dominate the food, which helps in crowding out and preventing the growth of many other bacteria.\n  \n- **Production of Bacteriocins**: These are proteins that exhibit antibacterial properties against other closely related bacteria.\n  \n- **Production of By-products**: The primary by-products of fermentation mentioned are alcohol, lactic acid, and acetic acid. These by-products, along with carbon dioxide and many others, help inhibit microbial and enzymatic activities. This selective inhibition helps maintain a controlled environment that supports food preservation.\n\n### Limitations and Specific Uses\n\n- **Temporary Preservation**: Not all fermented products are aimed primarily at preservation. For example, while dried grains like wheat have indefinite stability, wheat-based fermented products like bread are stable for far shorter periods.\n  \n- **Refrigeration Requirements**: Some fermented products, such as tempeh, require refrigeration and are stable only for a few days at refrigerated temperatures. Longer storage of tempeh without spoilage requires freezing.\n\n- **Alcohol as a Preservative**: Alcohol, produced through fermentation, serves as an effective preservative for products like grape juice (wine) and is also used to preserve and administer plant-based medicines (tinctures). When exposed to air, alcohol can ferment into acetic acid, transforming into vinegar.\n\n--- \n\nThis summary encapsulates the discussed roles of fermentation in food preservation, indicating both the advantages and selective applications, as well as clarifying the limitations to its efficacy in certain scenarios."

On the face of it, there was nothing remarkable about this; there were, after all, many terrific California sparkling wines made according to the traditional (Champagne) method.\n\nHowever, Gruet wasn’t from Napa or Sonoma, or from anyplace else in California. Gruet was from Truth or Consequences, a small town in New Mexico, and as surprising as that was, another surprise was in store when you called the winery looking for the owner. A Frenchwoman got on the line.\n\nIn 1983, Nathalie Gruet, her brother Laurent Gruet, and her husband, Farid Himeur, moved from France to Truth or Consequences, a stark plateau 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of Albuquerque, with the intention of making sparkling wine. As tourists years before, they’d fallen in love with the American Southwest and instinctively felt that it was wine country waiting to be discovered. Land prices were cheap. They figured that if the wine they made turned out bad, they wouldn’t be out a lot of capital; if it turned out well, the notoriety would launch them. And that’s exactly what happened. The first Gruet brut was released in 1989 to amazing press reviews. Crisp, frothy, and elegant, it’s easily the equal of many California sparklers.\n\nAs in Arizona, New Mexico’s first grapes were planted in the seventeenth century by Franciscan fathers who required wine for the Mass (this was earlier than in California by a few decades). But as in so many other states, disease, severe weather, and national Prohibition proved the New Mexican wine industry’s undoing. At least until the 1980s. Today, New Mexico boasts fifty-two wineries, including two meaderies (wineries that make mead, or wine from honey), proving that truth, consequences, and wine can be a formidable combination."

    "contenu": "# Making Off-Dry and Sweet Wine\n\n### Understanding Wine Types\n\nIn \"What Makes Wine, Wine?\" (on page 9), it is discussed that there are no set international definitions for terms such as off-dry and semisweet wines. However, it is generally acknowledged that an off-dry wine has a touch of natural sweetness remaining after fermentation, contrasting the fully sweet, dessert-level wine.\n\n### Fermentation and Sugar\n\nDuring fermentation, yeasts convert sugar in grapes to alcohol. Stopping fermentation early by adding sulfur dioxide kills the yeasts before all sugar is converted to alcohol. This produces off-dry wine with slight natural sweetness and just a hint of residual sugar enhancing the wine's fruitiness.\n\n### Techniques to Increase Sugar for Sweet Wines\n\nCreating wines that are innately sweet involves starting with grapes with high sugar levels achieved through:\n\n1. **Picking:** Selecting grapes when their sugar content is very high.\n2. **Raisinating:** The method of laying out grapes on mats to dry, concentrating their sugar.\n3. **Freezing on Vine:** Known as `eiswein`, this technique separates water from sugary juice via freezing.\n4. **Botrytis cinerea Infection:** Often called \"noble rot,\" this fungus consumes water in grapes, facilitating sugar concentration.\n\n### Challenges and Effects\n\nSweet wine production is risky and labor-intensive. Grape deterioration from mold, disease, or weather alongside potential predation makes sweet grapes scarce. Because of their high sugar prior to fermentation, either fermentation is stopped early, or yeast dies due to high alcohol levels (around 16%), leaving some natural sugar.\n\n### Economic Impact\n\nDue to their rarity and the complexity of their production, sweet wines are typically expensive and less common. Each method of increasing grape sugar content is discussed further in specific sections of wine literature."

Below is a structured summary of the content in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### OLD WORLD AND NEW WORLD WERE ONCE CLEAR-CUT EXTREMES BUT ARE NOW BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS TWO ENDS OF A WINE-STYLE SPECTRUM.\n\nOver recent decades, the global expansion of fine wine has transformed into a significant commercial endeavor, influencing the market profoundly. Originally, European winemakers adapted their styles to appeal to the preference for the fruitier New World style as demanded by influential wine critics and wider markets seeking varied tastes. Despite this shift towards catering to market demands, some traditionalists resist these changes, maintaining their unique winemaking philosophies despite the growing uniformity driven by market forces.\n\nThe variations now seen range from winemakers who emphasize bright and distinct flavors suited to contemporary tastes, to those preserving age-old traditions of viticulture and winemaking. It used to be that wines could be distinctly identified by their region of origin, but now, although regional influences remain significant, they are no longer the sole determinants of a wine's characteristics.\n\n### MARNIE’S CORNER\n\n**Topic: Usefulness of Old World/New World Concept in Wine Style**\n\nThe concept of distinguishing wines as either Old World or New World remains a useful tool. Preferences can vary; some individuals consistently favor one over the other, while others may choose based on different situations or meals. The New World style is generally considered more accessible and immediately enjoyable, whereas the Old World style might be viewed as more refined and possibly requiring more acquired taste.\n\nOpinions on wine, much like in music, fashion, or art, are highly personal and subject to individual perception and cultural influence—neither approach is definitively right or wrong.\n\n---\n\nThis structured summary captures the essential themes and insights discussed in the document regarding the dynamic and subjective nature of wine appreciation and production."

    "contenu": "### The Immutable 1855 Classification and the First Growths\n\nThe legendary treatise known as the 1855 Classification established four First Growths—the elegant Château Margaux and Château Lafite-Rothschild, the powerful Château Latour, and the earthy, sensual Château Haut-Brion. (As we'll see, Château Mouton-Rothschild was added later.) Here's how it happened: In 1855, Napoléon III asked Bordeaux's top château owners to rate their wines from best to worst for the Paris Universal Exhibition, a fair. One imagines that the château owners cringed. The prospect of rating the wines, one against the other, was nightmarish. The château owners stalled.\n\nEventually, the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce was invested with the job. There was no fretful hand-wringing about terroir. The Chamber members ranked the châteaux based on one stark quantitative measure: how much the wine sold for. The wines that sold for the most were called Premiers Crus, or First Growths. The Deuxiemes Crus, Second Growths, sold for a little less. The system continued down to Fifth Growths. In all, sixty-one châteaux were classified. The hundreds of châteaux whose wines cost less than the Fifth Growths were apparently not worth bothering about and were not classified at all.\n\n#### Provision of the Classification\nThe classification—clearly immutable as far as its authors were concerned—was never to be revised.\n\n#### Evolution of the Classification\nSince that time, entire books have been written on the 1855 Classification and the validity (or lack thereof) of its now-controversial rankings. For their part, château owners have, for decades, resented that the market will ultimately establish value. And that’s what has happened. In 2009, for example, the electronic wine exchange company Liv-ex reclassified the top châteaux using the same parameter—price—that was used in 1855. In the latest Liv-ex list (2011), Château Palmer, ranked twenty-eighth in 1855 (a Third Growth) has moved into seventh position (it would be a Second Growth today). Château Duhart-Milon, ranked thirty-eighth in 1855 (a Fourth Growth), would now be number eleven (it would also be a Second Growth today). And, seemingly against all odds, Château Lynch-Bages, ranked fifteenth in 1855 (a Fourth Growth), would now be number twelve (making it, too, a Second Growth today). In addition to the three châteaux just mentioned, a slew of others have climbed up to a higher rank, including Clerc-Milon, Pontet-Canet, Beychevelle, Grand-Puy-Lacoste, d’Armailhac, Cos d’Estournel, and Ducru-Beaucaillou.\n\n#### A Notable Change\nAn important footnote: One man did challenge, and ultimately change, the classification of his château: Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Obstinate and relentless, he petitioned the government for twenty years to upgrade Mouton-Rothschild from a Second Growth to a First. His persistence paid off in 1973; Château Mouton-Rothschild was moved up to First Growth rank. The classification was thereby changed for the first and last time.\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn the end, rankings and ratings are intellectually fascinating, but they remain temporal things. If the 1855 Classification has taught us anything, it's that wines can soar above (and below) their historic reputations. Rankings, in other words, can never fully replace the best evaluation method of all—tasting."

People's reactions to this combination vary - some dislike the heightened metallic taste, while others may not mind or notice this effect. It mentions that no one seems to mind the metallic effect of cooked meats, which contain umami, on red wine surprisingly. Factors like fats, proteins, and salt in the food could mitigate the amplification of tannins in wine, making some umami-rich foods like meat possibly harmonious with red wine.\n\n2. **Balance in Food and Wine Pairing**: The key to creating pleasing pairings of umami-rich foods and wine lies in balance among the five basic taste components: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. A dish where each flavor is well balanced is likely to pair well with a similarly balanced wine, enhancing the overall culinary experience. The document suggests that successful pairings enhance the enjoyment of both the food and the wine without needing to over-analyze the reasons why certain pairings work.\n\nOverall, the text advises enjoying food and wine without overcomplicating the reasons behind why certain combinations taste good, embodying a straightforward and pragmatic approach to culinary pairings."

The concept of potato porridge came to us from Jana and Vanda Fröberg, Swedish sisters who blog as \"Porridgehunters Were Here\" and have a book about porridge forthcoming. Mashed potatoes are potato porridge! In the Porridgehunters recipe, they mash the potatoes in the water they were cooked in, then thicken that up with rye flour and cook for a little while. But any creamy mashed potatoes can be considered porridge. You can even pre-ferment the potatoes: Cut them into small cubes and cover with water and/or whey in a bowl or jar. Leave to sit, covered, for a day or two, then cook. This improvisational concept acts as a segue from grain porridges to the fermentation of starchy tubers, typically prepared in porridge-like ways. For more potato fermentation ideas, see *Fermenting Potatoes*.\n\n### Poi\n\n**Poi** is a Hawaiian ferment of **taro** (*Colocasia esculenta*) mashed into a gluey purple paste. Taro is central and sacred to the native people of Hawai'i, who call it *kalo*. Poi made a significant impression on Captain James Cook, who described it in one of his earliest reports from Hawai'i: \"The only artificial dish we met with was a taro pudding; which, though a disagreeable mess from its sourness, was greedily devoured by the natives.\" By 1933, a study from the University of Hawai’i reported that \"other foods are taking the place of this ancient preparatory method.\""

Here’s a detailed structured summary of the content in the given text:\n\n### Page Title\n- **A SURVEY OF COMMON VEGETABLES**\n\n### General Information about Plant Stalks and Stems\n- Stalks and stems are crucial for supporting other plant parts and for conducting essential nutrients.\n- They consist of fibrous vascular tissue and special stiffening fibers which are much tougher than the vascular fibers themselves. \n- Some plants like celery and cardoons have this structure more heavily reinfornced.\n- Selecting the right variety of plant and proper water provision is essential to aid growth by ensuring the stalk can support itself.\n- Mechanical methods to consolidate the stems, like hilling with soil or tying the stalks together, may help prevent mechanical stress and promote growth.\n\n### Specific Focus on Asparagus\n- **Botanical Name:** _Asparagus officinalis_\n- **Origin:** Native to Eurasia, considered a delicacy in ancient Greek and Roman cultures.\n- **Description:** Asparagus is recognized by its tall stalk, which does not have ordinary leaves but small leaf-like bracts that protect immature clusters of photosynthetic branches known as phylloclades.\n\n### Historical and Modern Culinary Context\n- Asparagus was a prized vegetable historically, especially the variety known as \"white asparagus,\" which has been popular since the 18th century due to its delicate aroma.\n- It differs from green asparagus, which has a typical green color and sometimes more bitterness.\n- White asparagus is grown covered with soil to prevent it from turning green, which results in a paler color.\n  \n   ### Asparagus Post-Harvest\n- When harvested, asparagus is especially juicy and tasty fresh from the soil.\n- The rhizomes of the plant get depleted as the season progresses, affecting sugar levels and leading to a decline in the vegetable's juiciness and flavor.\n- Immediate changes in fiber content and sugar levels occur after harvest; rapid within the first 24 hours.\n- The storage effect can be mitigated through specific techniques, like soaking the spears in dilute sugar water.\n\n### Note on Asparagus and Rhizomes\n- Asparagus has long-lived underground rhizomes that can affect the flavor and texture over time, especially if not consumed fresh.\n\nThe excerpted document emphasis on the biological aspects of plant stems, particularly how they contribute to the growth and nutrient support in plants, as well as detailed information about the asparagus plant, its cultivation, and culinary value."

By 1650, they created concentrated and sweet Tokaji wine from grapes affected by a noble fungus.\n- **Evolving Techniques:** German and English wine importers discovered how to transfer wine from barrels to bottles, preventing too much fermentation and creating finer wines. Techniques like adding distilled alcohol during sea journeys were developed to stabilize wines.\n\n### Bottles and Corks\n- **Innovations in the 17th and 18th Centuries:** Introduction of gas-tight cork instead of cloth for Champagne bottles, and the evolution of the bottle design to withstand internal pressure, replacing the earlier amphora jars and barrels.\n\n### Pasteur and Scientific Understanding\n- **Pasteur's Contribution (1863):** Louis Pasteur, on Napoleon’s request, studies the destruction of wine by microbes, leading to essential findings about the role of yeast and oxygen in the wine spoilage and preservation process.\n- **Practical Implications:** Pasteur's work showed the importance of controlling oxygen exposure in wine to enhance and preserve its quality.\n\n### Scientific Approaches to Making Wine\n- **Expansion in Oenology:** The late 19th century saw the establishment of formal study in winemaking sciences, particularly in Bordeaux, France, and at the University of California, signaling a modernized approach to winemaking through scientific principles.\n\n### Key Concepts Highlighted:\n- **Role of Oxygen:** Oxygen's dual role in both potentially spoiling wine and aiding its maturation and preservation, emphasizing the need for careful management of oxygen levels during aging.\n\nThis text concisely combines historical advancements with scientific understanding, highlighting the evolution of wine preservation from rudimentary methods to sophisticated, scientifically informed techniques."

Italy produces countless sweet wines from many different grape varieties.\n\nE\nENOTECA: Wine library; a place where bottles of wine from different regions are displayed. Often these wines are also available for tasting. The most famous enoteca in Italy is in Siena. Today, enoteca is also used to indicate a wine bar.\nETICHETTA: Label.\n\nF\nFATTORIA: Tuscan term for a farm or wine estate. Many top Chianti producers use this term as part of their names—Fattoria di Felsina, for example.\nFIASCO: Literally, “a flask”; more often used for the straw-encased Chianti bottle that was a fixture of the bohemian lifestyle in the 1960s in the United States. Chiantis sold in fiaschi (the plural) were usually pretty thin and quite cheap. Today, very few Chiantis are sold in straw-covered bottles.\nFRIZZANTE: Slightly fizzy, but less so than SPARKLING WINE.\n\nG\nGRADAZIONE ALCOLICA: Percentage of ALCOHOL BY VOLUME.\nGRAN SELEZIONE: Highest-quality category in Chianti Classico. Wine must be made from estate-grown grapes and aged at least 30 months before it is sold.\nGRAPPA: A clear brandy (EAU-DE-VIE in French) made by distilling the POMACE left over after MUST or wine is pressed. Grappa di monovitigno is a grappa from a single grape variety, such as moscato or picolit. Because grappas made this way have a subtle suggestion of the AROMA and flavor of the original grapes, they are considered superior.\n\nI\nIMBOTTIGLIATO ALL'ORIGINE: Bottled at the source; the term may be used only by estates that produce and bottle the wine on the property where the grapes were grown.\nIMBOTTIGLIATO DA: Bottled by, which will be followed by the producer’s name; does not denote an ESTATE BOTTLED wine.\nIMBOTTIGLIATO DAL VITICOLTORE: Bottled by the grower; may be used only by growers bottling their own wines.\nINDICAZIONE GEOGRAFICA TIPICA (IGT): See page 328.\n\nL\nLIQUOROSO: Strong wine, often but not necessarily FORTIFIED, which can be sweet or not.\n\nM\nMETODO TRADIZIONALE: The Champagne method (MÉTHODE CHAMPENOISE) for making SPARKLING WINE; also referred to as metodo classico. Most top Italian sparkling wines are made this way.\n\nN\nNERO: Black or very dark red; said of both grapes and wines.\n```\n\nThis is a glossary of various terms relating to wine terms, types, and specifications, neatly categorized under letters indicating the alphabetical sequence."

Below is the structured content of the document's main points:\n\n### Quotes on Salt Usage by Chefs\n\n1. **Sharon Hage, York Street (Dallas)**\n   - **Comment**: Emphasizes the use of capers, anchovies, olives, and even prosciutto along with salt, not as replacements but to add another dimension of saltiness.\n\n2. **Andrew Carmellini, A Voce (New York City)**\n   - **Type of Salt**: Kosher salt, French sea salt, Maldon salt.\n   - **Usage**: Kosher salt for general seasoning, brining, and curing meats. French sea salt is preferred like Maldon for finishing. Maldon gives crunch and melts like snowflakes, great on raw fish.\n\n3. **Gina DePalma, Babbo (New York City)**\n   - **Type of Salt**: Salt.\n   - **Usage**: Used often in desserts. It works well for enhancing the sweetness in items like apple sorbet with salt, caramel and butterscotch.\n   - **Observation**: Salt does not always work, providing a distinct contrast in desserts.\n\n4. **Bradford Thompson, Mary Elaine’s at The Phoenician (Scottsdale, Arizona)**\n   - **Type of Salt**: Maldon salt, kosher salt.\n   - **Usage**: Maldon salt for finishing and kosher salt in raw applications or heavy-duty uses. Advises caution with strong-flavored salt like smoked salt.\n\n5. **Johnny Iuzzini, Jean Georges (New York City)**\n   - **Type of Salt**: Smoked Brittany sea salt, Maldon salt.\n   - **Usage**: Utilized mostly in desserts. Iuzzini points out that salt helps open the palate and stimulate taste buds. Prefers using it subtly so it's not directly noticeable, enhancing richness especially in sweet dishes.\n\n6. **General Comment** (No specific chef cited)\n   - **Type of Salt**: Vanilla salt.\n   - **Usage**: Used to add flair to sweet dishes, such as a classic sweet potato tart. Salt enhances flavour and makes desserts pop even though it generally supports the sweetness.\n\nThis structured information captures the different perspectives and details on the use of salt provided by various chefs from different cities."

    "contenu": "## Analysis of the Document on Fermentation and Yeast\n\n### Section 1: Fermentation Overview\n\n- **Definition and Process:** Fermentation transforms sugars like those from fruits, honey, or plant saps into alcoholic beverages. This process could, historically, be achieved with basic technology such as pottery vessels and remains feasible using common household items today.\n  \n- **Modern vs. Traditional Methods:** Contemporary literature on home brewing often highlights the use of chemical sterilization, specialized yeasts, and intricate equipment. However, the document notes these are not strictly necessary to produce fine beverages.\n\n- **Purpose of the Chapter:** Introduces simple, traditional methods that have been used for centuries. The focus is on the preparation of alcoholic beverages using simple carbohydrates (e.g., fruit, honey, sugar, and plant saps).\n\n- **Further Reading:** The subsequent chapter (presumably Chapter 9) is suggested for readers interested in more involved processes of fermentation, specifically relating to cereal grains and starchy tubers.\n\n### Section 2: Yeast\n\n- **Role and Definition:** Yeasts are single-cell fungi that convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide, aiding in the production of alcoholic beverages and bread.\n\n- **Visibility and Action:** Despite being microscopic, the impact of yeasts (e.g., bubbling in fermenting liquids and dough rising) has been noted and is integral to the understanding of fermentation.\n\n- **Etymology:** \n  - **Yeast:** The term derives from the Dutch word \"gist,\" which is rooted in the Greek \"zestos,\" meaning \"boiling hot.\"\n  - **Fermentation:** Originates from the Latin \"fervere,\" also translating to \"boil.\" This reflects on the transformative action of yeasts which, while not boiling in the literal sense, result in the bubbling effect that is similar to boiling.\n\n- **Cultural and Linguistic Significance:** The document emphasizes the deep-seated cultural and linguistic roots of yeast and fermentation, illustrating their fundamental roles not only in culinary but also in linguistic domains.\n\nThe document provides an essential grounding in the basics of fermentation and the biological role of yeast, connecting historical and contemporary practices with linguistic insights."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content provided:\n\n### Title: Creating Pairings That Work\n\n#### Introduction\n- **Main Point**: The document discusses the importance of adjusting dishes to pair well with wine, asserting that it's critical especially for showcasing wine at special events.\n- **Quote**: \"The best chefs, professional and amateur alike, avoid thinking, 'It’s all about my food, and the wine be damned.'\"\n\n#### Key 1. Ingredients\n- **Overview**: It highlights the common practice of thinking about dish ingredients first when considering wine pairings.\n- **Ingredient Variations**: The text explains that cooking methods and variations in the ingredients also influence wine selection. Things like meat, fish, vegetables, and their preparation and inherent characteristics (such as freshness and seasonality) play a role.\n  - **Meat**: Distinguishes between types of meat (red, white, different fish types) and how their characteristics can influence wine pairing.\n  - **Vegetables and Other**: Discusses other food categories like vegetables and cheeses, stressing the importance of seasonality and freshness.\n\n#### Considerations for Pairing\n- **Seasonality**: Emphasizes that the time of year affects food's flavor and, consequently, its pairing with wine, due to factors like diet and the natural environment of the food source.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Wild salmon during the salmon run described as richer and more flavorful than farmed salmon.\n  - Fresh-picked spring peas and summer corn are better than preserved or canned alternatives.\n  \n#### Closing Note\n- **Advice on Ingredients**: Mentions that a handful of versatile ingredients can improve wine and food pairings, advising readers to look for a list of \"magic\" ingredients supposedly listed elsewhere in the document.\n\nThe document aims to help the reader understand that the complexity of creating a perfect wine pairing can be tackled effectively by focusing on understanding food characteristics and the impact of seasons and freshness on food, rather than sticking strictly to static pairing rules."

    "contenu": "The document is a detailed discussion about salt, focusing on its effects on human health, its iodization, taste preferences, and its physical properties. Below is a structured summary of the provided text:\n\n### Health Effects of Salt\n- **Blood Pressure and Heart Health**: Excessive intake of salt results in elevated plasma volume, leading to high blood pressure, which can damage the blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Low-salt diets have been found to lower high blood pressure modestly.\n- **Cholesterol Levels**: Low-salt diets have undesirable impacts, including increased cholesterol levels. Blood pressure can be influenced nonmedically by lifestyle choices like a diet rich in potassium, calcium, and other minerals.\n- **Kidneys, Bones, and Digestive System**: High sodium levels can have indirect effects on several body systems including bones and kidneys, potentially causing loss of bone calcium and exacerbating chronic kidney disease.\n\n### Effects of Iodized Salt\n- **Health Benefits**: Iodized salts contain trace amounts of potassium iodide, essential for thyroid gland functioning, which regulates body heat production, metabolism, and the development of the nervous system.\n- **Sources and Deficiency**: Iodine is found in ocean fish, seaweeds, and crops, and its deficiency was common in inland and rural areas, leading to physical and mental impairments.\n\n### Salt Taste and Preferences\n- **Personal Preference and Sensitivity**: Individuals’ salt preference varies due to inherited differences in taste receptors, general health, age, and experience. Young adults can typically identify a solution as salty if it has a certain minimum concentration of salt.\n\n### Physical Properties of Salt\n- **Dissolution and Melting**: Salt generally remains solid unless dissolved. Room-temperature water can dissolve approximately 35% of its weight in salt to form a saturated solution at 26% salt concentration. The speed at which salt dissolves differs by particle size; finer salts dissolve faster.\n- **Temperature Effects**: Salt melts at 1,600°F/800°C and evaporates at around 3,000°F/1,500°C, conditions that can be typically seen in intense heating environments like wood fires or glowing coals. Salt vapor can deposit thin films on food above such heat sources. \n\nThis structured content gives a comprehensive view of the various aspects of salt as discussed in the text."

These bacteria thrive in legume root nodules, converting atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. Legumes not only enrich the soil but also provide vital nutrients to both humans and the animals they keep. Historian Ken Albala in his book *Beans: A History*, notes that beans are virtually indestructible once dried and properly stored, serving as a crucial food reserve during times of famine and providing substantial nourishment. In some regions, particularly where population densities are high, beans have become an essential part of the diet. In Europe and developed countries, historically, only those who couldn't afford meat relied heavily on beans, turning them into a symbol of lower economic status, sometimes referred as \"poor man's meat.\"\n\nIn addition to their storability, the hardiness of beans can make them difficult to digest, similar to some grains, and even more so in the case of soybeans. This is due to the presence of enzyme inhibitors that make the protein content indigestible. Despite the humorous connotation often associated with beans in various cultures—particularly their role in causing flatulence—the methods of soaking and prolonged cooking, and notably, fermentation, have been pertinent to making their nutrients more readily available for digestion.\n```"

Here’s a structured analysis of the content:\n\n## Sorghum Beer Making Process\n\n### Cooking and Initial Fermentation\n1. **Cook the Soured Mash:** The process begins by cooking the soured mash in water for several hours. During this phase, sugars in the mash are caramelized by adding water as needed to maintain a gruel-like consistency.\n2. **Cooling the Mash:** After cooking, the mash is cooled to around body temperature.\n3. **Add Malted Sorghum:** Raw ground malted sorghum is added to the cooled mixture. This introduces yeasts necessary for alcohol fermentation. Alternatively, a packet of yeast can be used.\n\n### Fermentation\n1. **Fermentation Environment:** The mixture should be left to ferment in a warm spot, protected from flies.\n2. **Duration of Fermentation:**\n   - In tropical regions, fermentation occurs more rapidly, with time measured in hours.\n   - In temperate zones, fermentation typically takes two or three days.\n\n### Bottling and Carbonation\n1. **Straining:** Once fermentation is complete, the beer is strained through cheesecloth.\n2. **Bottling:** The strained beer is then bottled in plastic soda bottles. This additional step allows the beer to ferment a few more hours and traps carbonation.\n3. **Caution:** Fresh sorghum beer pressurizes quickly due to its live nature, so care should be taken not to overcarbonate.\n\n### Context and Significance\n- **Cultural Relevance:** Sorghum beer is an indigenous beverage with deep roots in the socioeconomic culture of the community where it’s brewed.\n\nThis document emphasizes not only the technical aspects of brewing sorghum beer but also its cultural importance, providing a detailed insight into both the method and its context."

When asked which white grape has the most potential for excellence here, most Oregon winemakers name it. But Oregon chardonnay’s road to success has been rocky, and the state is just beginning to produce the kind of stop-you-in-your-tracks chardonnays that will command top dollar. I have to admit that, as of this writing, I’m only cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor the few really fabulous chardonnays, the quality surge has been largely the result of new Dijon clones brought to Oregon from Burgundy and now widely planted. (Originally, most Oregon chardonnay was made from a warm-climate California clone that didn’t ripen well in Oregon’s cool climate, and thus produced thin, lean, bland wines.) Over the coming decade, Dijon clones are expected to be the chardonnay equivalent of a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\n**Caption under image:**  \n_The Willamette (rhymes with dammit) Valley is lush and serene._"

The main points are as follows:\n\n- **Chile's Wine Laws**: Chile lacks strict wine laws, unlike the rigorous French system. There are specifications about grape varieties, wine-producing regions, and other regulatory details, which came into effect in 1994 and 1995. Subregions and zonal distinctions within key viticultural areas are denoted as \"Denominación de Origen\" (DO), established by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Servicio Agricola Ganadero.\n\n- **Laws from 1995**:\n  - **Wine Labeling**: A wine that labels a viticultural region must have at least 75% of its contents originating from there.\n  - **Grape Variety Labeling**: If a grape variety is named on the label, at least 75% of the wine must be composed of that specified grape.\n  - **Vintage Labeling**: For wines indicating a vintage, at least 75% of the wine must be from that specified vintage.\n  \n- **Standard Practices**:\n  - Most Chilean wineries adhere to an 85% minimum standard for the aspects mentioned above, aligning with European Union standards for exports.\n\n- **Aging Requirements**:\n  - For wine designations like 'Reserva Especial' and 'Gran Reserva,' aging in oak is legally mandated in Chilean law. The document notes a critical perspective on labeling a $14 wine as a 'Gran Reserva' suggesting it might be misplaced enthusiasm.\n\nOverall, the document outlines the basic regulatory framework and labeling standards for wines produced in Chile, reflecting a combined emphasis on regional authenticity and compliance with international standards."

    "contenu": "### THE MODERN GREEK WINE INDUSTRY\n\nFor all its hegemony as one of the most important wine producers of antiquity, Greece has had an arduous climb into the modern world of fine wine. During the Middle Ages, the country was part of the Byzantine Empire, and the best Greek wines were made by monks following monastic traditions. But the fall of Byzantium and the subsequent occupation of Greece by the Ottoman Turks effectively brought an end to Greece’s respected place among wine producers. The Turks did not formally forbid winemaking for the Christian population, but the strictures and taxes imposed during nearly four hundred years of Ottoman domination were severe enough to prevent Greece from developing a significant wine industry. Greek wine remained the work of peasants whose necessary goal was subsistence, not sophistication.\n\nGreece’s wine industry remained largely undeveloped until the twentieth century. As was true in virtually every other European country, the devastating effects of the insect phylloxera, which arrived in Greece in the late 1890s, lasted for several decades. This was followed by two world wars, and then Greece’s own civil war, the combination of which left the country’s wine industry in ruins. By the 1960s, most Greek wines were still being sold in bulk, directly from barrels, to buyers who brought their own jugs to fill. It was not until the mid-1980s, with Greece’s entry into the European Union, that the country’s wine industry began to shift away from very inexpensive table wines intended for local consumption, toward wines of finer quality. This meant lowering grape yields substantially, improving viticultural techniques in the vineyards, employing more modern equipment, and in many cases, using expensive, small oak barrels.\n\nThe Boutari Winery's modern tasting room on Crete, one of the most ancient centers of civilization in Europe, dating from the Minoan period circa 2700 B.C.\n\nToday there are some six hundred wineries in Greece, and the country’s wine industry"

Below is the structured content of this document breakdown:\n\n### Text Structure\n\n1. **Strawberries**\n    - **Physical Traits**: Strawberries have fragile structure and a short shelf life in cold storage. Their flavor characteristics include hints of pineapple, thanks to the presence of ethyl esters and other compounds.\n    - **Species Mentioned**:\n        - *F. virginiana* - Native to North America, its big-sized fruits introduced to Europe.\n        - *F. chiloensis* - Grown in Chile and brought to France in 1712.\n        - *F. × ananassa* - A hybrid species with large and flavorful fruits with pineapple aroma, created across Chilean and European varieties.\n    - **Historical Context**: Native European strawberry (*F. vesca* and *F. moschata*, also known as wild and woodland strawberry) described, including mentions from Roman literature and their characteristics through the 15th century.\n\n2. **Elderberry and Barberry**\n    - **General Characteristics**: Both are minor fruits, recognized for their pleasant aromatics and the utility of their tart berries.\n    - **Species Mentioned**:\n        - Elderberry - Belongs to the genus *Sambucus*, common across the northern hemisphere, rich in anthocyanin pigments and other antioxidant phenolic compounds.\n        - Barberry - Described as a shrubby species from the northern hemisphere, loaded with antioxidant phenolic compounds.\n    - **Usage**: Commonly cooked or made into wine due to their tart nature and presence of antinutritional lectins that require heating to inactivate.\n\n3. **Food Words: Berry, Strawberry**\n    - **Etymology**:\n        - **Berry**: Derived from an Indo-European root meaning \"to shine,\" indicating the colors of small fruits.\n        - **Strawberry**: The name originates from a root for \"to spread, to strew,\" referencing how the plant spreads via runners, and the term *straw* indicating the stalks strewn in fields during harvesting.\n\nThis breakdown provides an informative perspective on strawberry development and highlights the usage and properties of other lesser-known berries."

Here's a structured summary of the information:\n\n### Qualities of Shellfish:\n1. **Bivalves (e.g., scallops, clams, mussels, oysters)**:\n   - Have tender \"swimming\" muscles and are mainly composed of adductor muscles, connective tissues, and small tubes.\n   - Their texture can be slick and chewy when raw and tender when properly cooked.\n   - Cooking affects their texture significantly due to the collagen breaking down during the cooking process.\n   - Flavor is influenced by their reproductive stage; becomes less tasty during spawning.\n   \n2. **Texture and Composition**:\n   - Mollusks' texture changes with age and reproductive stages, becoming creamier as they prepare for spawning.\n   - Abalone, octopus, and squid consist mainly of muscle tissue with collagen and complex fibers, becoming tender when cooked long enough.\n\n3. **Flavor Aspects**:\n   - Rich flavor comes from amino acids and other taste-active substances used for energy and osmotic balance.\n   - Shellfish from different waters have varying flavors due to different substances like TMAO and amino acids they accumulate.\n   - Certain compounds like dimethyl sulfide can enhance flavors, especially noted in seafood soups.\n\n### Handling and Preparing Molluscs:\n- **Freshness**: \n  - Fresh shellfish must have an intact shell and active muscle to hold the shells tightly.\n  - Shellfish should be kept on ice under damp conditions to prevent spoilage.\n- **Cleaning**:\n  - Soaking in saltwater helps remove residual sand and dirt.\n  - Cooking methods include shucking oysters and clams to remove the raw meat and clean the inside of the shell.\n\nThe document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the culinary properties and handling techniques for various types of shellfish, emphasizing the importance of freshness and careful preparation for optimal flavor and texture."

It should be well-wrapped to ensure quality is maintained and can be kept in the freezer for at least six months.\n\n#### 2. **Cooking with Tempeh:**\n   - The text explains various ways tempeh can be prepared and cooked. Common preparations include cutting tempeh into strips for frying, cubing it for curries, or using it in barbecues with sweet sauces.\n   - It is suggested to soak tempeh strips in a simple saltwater brine (sometimes spiced or with tamarind) before frying. An alternative is steaming the tempeh before marinating and frying to ensure thorough cooking.\n   - The author personally likes to steam the tempeh before marinating and cooking it.\n\n#### 3. **Personal Cooking Preference:**\n   - The author enjoys tempeh marinated in a mix of sweet, sour, and salty components including honey or another sweetener, vinegar or sauerkraut juice, miso or tamari, and sometimes hot sauce.\n   - An inspiring marinade recipe discussed involves salt, garlic, and coriander seeds, which are pounded together into a mix. This recipe idea was taken from Ken Albala’s book *Beans: A History*.\n\n### Illustration:\n- The document features a sketch of tempeh, visually highlighting its texture and form, which typically includes visible soybeans bound together into a solid block.\n\nThis detailed overview should help readers understand the basic storage and diverse culinary uses of tempeh, especially for those unfamiliar with this food product."

Note the weight increase, which indicates the amount of CO₂ added.\n\n**Example Calculation**:\n- Before Carbonation (500 ml bottle): Weight of liquid alone\n- After Carbonation (500 ml bottle): Increase by 4.3 grams due to the added CO₂\n\n**Note**: Ensure that the cap is removed when weighing after carbonation to avoid including the weight of compressed CO₂ within the sealed bottle.\n\n---\n\n**Title: ANOTHER IMPORTANT CARBONATION PROPERTY OF ALCOHOL: CARBONATING RESPONSIBLY**\n\n**Key Points**:\n\n- **Efficient Absorption**: CO₂ accelerates the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream, leading to quicker intoxication.\n- **Impact on Intoxication**: Faster absorption can cause blood alcohol content (BAC) to spike rapidly, mainly affecting the small intestines rather than the stomach.\n\n**Goal**:\n- To mitigate quick intoxication, it is recommended to keep the alcohol content of carbonated drinks moderate.\n\n**Personal Experience**:\n- The author previously carbonated drinks to as much as 20-26% alcohol, which led to significant intoxication. Presently, the mixtures are typically between 14-17% alcohol, providing a more balanced and enjoyable experience without excessive inebriation.\n\n---\n\n**THE PROBLEM OF FOAMING AND THE THREE C’S OF CARBONATION**\n\n(No additional details provided)"
