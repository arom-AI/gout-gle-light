It originates from the large herb _Rheum rhabarbarum_, native to temperate Eurasia and popular for being one of the first plant-like items to grow during spring, leveraging greenhouse production in modern agricultural practices. Historically, aside from its use in pies and tarts, rhubarb was used medicinally in Chinese culture and as a food item in various countries. Key modern uses include pies, tarts, and preserves, relying on sugar for sweetness and methods that preserve color and reduce fibrousness.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n1. Historical uses include traditional medicine and food in several cultural contexts (e.g., Iran, Afghanistan, Poland).\n2. 19th-century developments include improvements in production techniques, leading to global popularity.\n3. Rhubarb stalks may appear red, green, or intermediate, influenced by specific varieties and growing conditions.\n\n**Acidity Source:**\nRhubarb's acidity derives from multiple organic acids, notably oxalic acid.\n\n---\n\n**Subtitle: Melons**\n\n**Content:**\nMelons, specifically categorized under _Cucumis melo_, are closely related to cucumbers and originated from the subtropics of Asia. They were domesticated in Central Asia and made their debut in the Mediterranean around the 1st century CE, valued for their size, growth rate, and symbolic cultural significance. They are renowned for their variety in terms of rind appearances, flesh colors, and sweetness.\n\n**Key Nutritional and Usage Information:**\n1. Melons are a rich source of beta-carotene.\n2. Primarily consumed fresh, either sliced or pureed.\n\n**Etymology:** \nThe word \"melon\" in Greek initially referred to \"apple\" and later was generalized to include various seeded fruits, leading to the modern term _melon_ deriving from _melopepon_ or \"apple-gourd.\"\n\n---"

Below is the structured content derived from the document.\n\n### EARLY MODERN SAUCES: MEAT ESSENCES, EMULSIONS\n\n- **Timeline & Technology**: The period from 1400 to 1700 witnessed a transformation in the preparation of sauces, with recipes calling for fewer spices and a heavier use of ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice. Techniques evolved from using coarse bread and almond thickeners to utilizing flour, butter, and egg emulsions.\n  \n- **Location & Culinary Evolution**: In France, where much of this evolution took place, culinary methods began to focus more on finessing the flavors inherent in the food, rather than just thickening or extending dishes. French cooks and chemists started concentrating meat juices, which is said to form the essence of cooking and nourishment, according to François Marin.\n\n- **Philosophy in Cooking**: Marin admired the Chinese approach to flavor harmony, but noted that French cuisine tends to emphasize creating complexity and harmony by concentrating available flavors rather than adding a variety.\n\n- **François Marin's Quote**: Marin encapsulated this philosophy around 1750 by stating that good taste in cooking involves avoiding the masking of tastes with excessive flavoring. Instead, the goal is to concentrate the essence of meat which then enhances the flavors of other foods.\n\n### The Flowering of French Sauces\n- **Viability of Sauces**: Marin categorized his sauces into bouillons, potages, jus, consommés, and restaurants (sauces crafted for restoring). He endorsed a systematic approach that could allow even limited resources to yield an infinite variety of sauces.\n\n- **Development of Cookbooks**: French cookbooks expanded to include a wide array of sauces and stews, including several classic sauces besides newer, more inventive types made using emulsifying techniques, like hollandaise and mayonnaise, along with béchamel.\n\n### François Marin on Cooking as a Chemical Art\n- **Cooking as Science**: Marin in 1750 articulated that modern cooking parallels the discipline of chemistry. The process consists of breaking down meats into their purest forms, mixing them, and ensuring no single taste dominates, thereby creating a balanced and harmonious outcome.\n\nThis exploration captures the essence of the culinary innovations in sauce-making during the early modern era, emphasizing both the philosophical and practical shifts that have influenced contemporary cuisine."

    "contenu": "### PENEDES STILL WINES\n\nAs the cava industry began to take serious form, Penedès still wines continued to evolve. The leading winery, Torres, was established in 1870. More than ever, this large (producing 3 million cases each year), family-owned dynasty epitomizes the maverick streak for which Catalans are known.\n\nTorres has experimental plantings of over 250 different non-Penedès varieties, including roussanne, syrah, and chenin blanc from France; riesling and Müller-Thurgau from Germany; nebbiolo from Italy; and zinfandel from the United States. In addition to these, the winery has begun cultivating nearly extinct, ancient Catalan varieties that were common pre-phylloxera. In 1970, when virtually all other Spanish whites were flat, soft, and even partially oxidized from being made and aged in wood, Torres produced Viña Sol, a snappy, aromatic, fresh white, made from 100 percent parellada, and the first white wine in the country to be fermented in temperature-controlled, stainless-steel tanks. The winery is also environmentally conscious. Having shunned pesticides nearly two decades ago, they are today committed to reducing the winery’s CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020.\n\nTorres went on to a number of other firsts, but their greatest achievement has always been the bodega’s most prestigious wine, formerly called Gran Coronas Black Label (now known as Mas La Plana), made from 100 percent cabernet sauvignon. In 1979, when that wine (then a cabernet/tempranillo/monastrell blend) was slipped into a French blind tasting and came out on top, over a field of renowned classified Bordeaux, Torres’s reputation for quality was sealed. Today, under the leadership of the hard-driving Miguel A. Torres, the family also owns wineries in Ribera del Duero and Rioja, as well as in Chile, where they were one of the early European investors in the modern era. In 1997, the ever-visionary bodega even established a joint venture in China, called Great Wall Torres. And, of course, Torres has a California operation—Marimar Estate, a prominent small winery in Sonoma, California, run by Marimar Torres, Miguel’s sister. Indeed, the influential British magazine Decanter named Miguel the most influential Spanish winegrower of all, and placed him second on the “Power List” of vintners worldwide.\n\nThe impulse to be avant-garde and the penchant for experimentation is not, however, limited to such a large bodega as Torres. The far smaller bodega Jean León was the first to plant and then produce chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon in the late 1960s. Cuttings for the chardonnay came from the Corton-Charlemagne holdings of Louis Jadot, and the cabernet came from Château Lafite-Rothschild. I pulled a bottle of 1977 Jean León cabernet sauvignon from my cellar recently. It was thirty-five years old, and its aroma was as sensual as an old Bordeaux; the rich cassis fruit was mesmerizing. The Penedès may be best known for its every-night wines, but in the hands of a great producer, these still wines can be almost shockingly good. Besides Torres and Jean León, there are many other excellent small producers of still wines, including the single-estate (pago) Can Rafols dels Caus. The cava producer Segura Viudas also makes a very fine still Penedès wine called Creu de Lavit."

The vineyards spread in triangular fashion from an inland point north of the charming town of Jerez de la Frontera to the small maritime towns of Puerto de Santa María, on the Bay of Cádiz, and Sanlúcar de Barrameda, on the Atlantic shore at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.\n\nThe best vineyards lie in the heart of this triangle, a region designated as Jerez Superior by Sherry’s Consejo Regulador, or governing body. Sherry’s Consejo—legally constituted in 1935—was the first in Spain, and Sherry was the first DO, awarded that designation two years earlier, in 1933, by the national government. Within the Jerez Superior region, the vineyards of highest regard roll like waves over gentle hillocks. Looking at them, I am always reminded of the rippling landscape of the ocean floor. On these beautifully smooth and curved hills, the verdant vines glisten like emeralds in the glaring summer sun.\n\nMillennia ago, the Sherry region was covered by a vast sea. Thus, not surprisingly today, the best soil type—usually found on the tops of the hillocks—is composed of the remnants of marine sediments mixed with chalky calcium carbonates (including limestone) and prehistoric sea fossils. Called albariza, the soil is stark white, crumbly, light as cake mix, and has very good water-holding capacity. The latter helps the vines endure southern Spain’s long, often drought-ridden summers. In addition, since albariza soils tend to be the highest in elevation, vines planted in albariza tend to catch sea breezes—a boon for preserving acidity in the grapes. Less prized than albariza is arena, sand, often right beside the coast, and barro, a low-lying, brownish, more fertile clay where, today, mostly sugar beets and corn are planted.\n\n**THE QUICK SIP ON SHERRY**\n\n- AS CHAMPAGNE is in France or Port is in Portugal, Sherry is Spain’s most complex and labor-intensive wine. The immense difficulty of producing this handcrafted wine has earned it its reputation as one of the world's most spellbinding wines.\n- SHERRY IS MADE in multiple styles. These range from hauntingly bonedry to gorgeously sweet.\n- SHERRY COUNTRY is also one of Spain’s most thrilling food regions and the place where the small dishes known as tapas were first created. Sherry is their quintessential accompaniment."

    "contenu": "The document discusses several qualities that contribute to the greatness of a wine, highlighting integration, precision, and complexity.\n\n### Integration\n- **Key Idea:** Wine's greatness is partly determined by how well its various components and flavors merge into a cohesive whole.\n- **Detail:** An integrated wine, where the components blend seamlessly, has the potential to exhibit a unique and stunning character. Conversely, a wine that lacks this balance may have flavors that are discernible as separate, which can detract from its overall impression.\n\n### Precision\n- **Key Idea:** Clarity and definition in wine's flavors are crucial.\n- **Detail:** Great wines should have precise and well-defined flavors, analogous to tuning a radio to the perfect frequency. Just as a clear radio signal allows every note of music to be appreciated, precise flavor profiles in wine enable each nuance to be experienced distinctly.\n- **Example:** The document compares precision in flavor to the echo of a church bell in the mountains — clear and discernible.\n\n### Complexity\n- **Key Idea:** Complexity in wine pertains to having multiple, nuanced layers of flavors and aromas.\n- **Detail:** Unlike simpler wines, which might be straightforward and monochromatic in flavor, complex wines offer a range of flavors that unfold and reveal themselves over time, each sip giving a different aspect of the wine.\n- **Metaphor:** Complex wines are akin to a multilayered conversation where multiple points are made, in contrast to a simple statement.\n\nThe document emphasizes that great wines are notable not just for their richness or boldness but more so for how flavors are integrated, defined, and expressed in a multi-dimensional manner."

    "contenu": "The document provided is titled \"HARD WORK FOR THE LAZY DRINKER—THE NO-TECH GIN AND TONIC\". It outlines a meticulous method for preparing a gin and tonic with particular attention to the technique to minimize disruption to the drink’s carbonation and enhance its flavor. Here’s the structured breakdown of the process:\n\n### Preparation Steps:\n1. **Pre-Freezing and Drink Assembly:**\n   - *Pre-freeze* your glass and gin.\n   - **Pour** the gin into the glass.\n   - **Tilt** the glass and then pour in fresh, ice-cold tonic water.\n   - **Squeeze** some fresh lime.\n   - **Gently place** the drink in an un-tempered freezer.\n   - **Place** the lime on top and drink it lazily head.\n\n2. **Detailed Instructions for Prior to Consumption:**\n   - Ensure the glass is in the freezer well before drink time to keep it cold.\n   - Cut the lime into quarters; use one quarter per drink.\n   - At drink time, take the glass and gin out of the freezer.\n   - Pour 1¾ ounces (52.5 ml) of gin into the glass **before** you add tonic.\n   - Tilt the glass to a 45-degree angle and slowly pour ice-cold tonic water into the glass.\n   - As you pour, raise the glass back to vertical once you’ve reached the 5-ounce (150-ml) mark and stop pouring when you have reached this volume.\n\n3. **Mixing Technique:**\n   - Avoid stirring the drink to prevent liberating bubbles.\n   - The order of operations is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the mix.\n\n4. **Addition of Ice and Lime:**\n   - Use freezer-cold ice, not tempered ice for minimal dilution and avoiding thermal shock.\n   - Slide the ice in gently with a bar spoon last to promote mixing.\n   - Add the lime quarter into the top of the glass; it will sit just above the drink, releasing a nice aroma and avoiding ongoing bubble nucleation.\n\nThe guide emphasizes the importance of minimizing bubble nucleation by controlling how and when each component is added to the mix, aiming for an intact, aromatic, and gently mixed gin and tonic."

    "contenu": "# The Story of Foodpairing\n\n## Foodpairing: A way out of the Omnivore's Dilemma\n\nMany times a day, we make the decision to eat or drink something. We rarely give these choices much thought, often making them almost automatically, but that does not mean they are easy choices. Humans are omnivores, meaning that in principle we can eat any kind of plant or animal. We thrive all over the planet because we can find food almost anywhere.\n\nThe omnivore in us is always on the lookout for potentially dangerous substances: something that tastes bitter might be toxic, foods that are very sour or spicy can cause us pain, the smell of spoiled foods tells us not to touch them. There is safety in familiarity, in only eating things we have obviously survived eating before. But when it comes to choosing food, safety is not our only motivation.\n\nA characteristic we share with many other animals is our desire to avoid boredom and seek variety. This is good too, because a monotonous diet could lead to us missing out on key nutrients. Our drive for change means that once we get used to something, we are motivated to go in search of new experiences. We want new foods, with new flavours that will keep us stimulated. But these foods also pose a risk, because we don't know if they are safe to eat. These two opposing forces – eating only familiar food and staying safe versus experiencing exciting new flavours at the risk of getting sick – constitute what is known as the Omnivore's Dilemma.^1\n\n### How do we know if a new food will taste as good as a familiar one?\n\nToday, we rarely encounter genuinely dangerous foods. Thanks to generations of food scientists and nutritionists, we can buy a food product almost anywhere in the world and eat it without suffering any harmful consequences. In the affluent Western world, healthy, non-allergic consumers are able to choose from a virtually limitless variety of food and drink items. This poses a new problem: what to eat?\n\nWe live in a time of food choice overload. It is disappointing when the food you have chosen or made does not deliver the much hoped for exciting new flavour experience. If you run a restaurant or food company, it is a challenge to keep developing new recipes and products, because it is difficult to predict which flavours will satisfy existing customers and attract new ones. The theory of Foodpairing aims to do exactly this. Knowing which aroma and taste components make up the flavours of food and drink products makes it possible to predict which new combinations will be a good match."

    "contenu": "The content of the document provides insightful information about cheese, focusing on its qualities, storage recommendations, and specific characteristics of cheese crystals. Here’s a structured outline based on the document:\n\n### Le Ménagier de Paris\n\n- This is mentioned as a formula to recognize good cheese, albeit with a poetic expression that contrasts various sensory descriptions.\n\n### Desirable Qualities in Cheese\n\n- The text narrates a set of characteristics desired in a good cheese, such as resistance to mold and a certain weight, yet specifies that young goat cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert need a different assessment, focused more on taste.\n\n### Purchasing Cheese\n\n- **Cut to Order:** The narrative advises purchasing cheese freshly cut as you watch, to ensure you get the freshest portions, as opposed to precut portions which might be older.\n\n### Storage Recommendations\n\n- **Temperature:** Cheese should ideally be stored cool but not cold, to preserve its freshness without disrupting the ripening process. The ideal is above room temperature but below 80°F (26°C).\n- **Handling:** Cheese should not be served directly from the refrigerator as the cold congeals the milk fat and impacts flavor and texture.\n  \n### Cheese Crystals\n\n- **Occurrence:** These are described as sometimes creating a crunchy texture in the cheese. These crystals can be of various types, such as calcium lactate or tyrosine.\n- **Cheese Types:** The text details specific cheeses like Roquefort, Cheddar, Parmesan, Gruyère, and Gouda, discussing the different types of crystals that might be found in each.\n\nThe document captures rich descriptions and practical advice for both selecting and maintaining the quality of cheese, touching upon the aspects from storage to the scientific underpinnings of cheese crystals."

    "contenu": "The structured content of the document mainly describes the pairing of Mencía wine with different types of food, and provides pointers on what foods this wine variety complements well.\n\n### PAIRING WITH FOOD\n\nMencía wine has a good compatibility with food due to its abundant acidity and moderate levels of alcohol. When aged with balanced oak, Mencía becomes a food-friendly wine, highlighted with flavors of thyme, marjoram, and rosemary. It pairs effectively with a variety of dishes:\n\n- **Stuffed Vegetables & Ratatouille:** Works well with green vegetable flavors like stuffed peppers to eggplant parmigiana.\n- **Robust Meat Dishes:** Especially good with red meat dishes, lamb, oxtails, and shanks.\n- **Hearty Stews & Braises:** Enhances the flavor of rich, textured stews and braises even with a strong earthy quality, like in the case of beet borscht.\n- **Pasta & Poultry:** Pairs well with pasta and dishes that have a meat or poultry base, such as tomato or meat stug bases.\n- **Cooks well with:** It is an alternative to classic Pinot Noir. Excellent with dishes incorporating pork like bourguignon or roasted lamb with red-wine reduction sauce.\n- **Additional Recommendations:** Suits dishes with squab, cooked anyway, and is exceptional with roast duck.\n\n### PAIRING POINTERS\n\nSpecific foods that align well with Mencía include:\n\n- **Vegetable Dishes:** Enhances dishes with earth tones like stuffed peppers, dolmas, eggplant lasagna, or zucchini casserole.\n- **Rich Stews and Braises:** Ideal for dishes like lamb shanks or beef stew, complementing Mencía's acidity and tannins.\n- **Fresh and Dried Herbs:** Works well with dishes flavored with thyme, marjoram, bay leaf, occasionally rosemary, herbal marinades, and salsa verde.\n- **Combination of Flavors:** Mixing green and red ingredients, as in grilled asparagus with pomegranate molasses dressing, or with sautéed long beans, and zucchini.\n- **Strongly-flavored Meat and Fowl:** Bierzo wines with squab, lamb, and turkey are complemented by a tapenade of black olives and herbs.\n- **Paired with Spanish Meats:** Exceptionally well with sharp Spanish chorizo or morcilla. \n\nThis comprehensive guide on Mencía wine pairing illuminates the versatility and complementarity of the wine with a variety of cooking styles and ingredients, enhancing both traditional and innovative dishes."

Mais tandis que la saveur du persil évoque la pluie froide, la feuille de coriandre est chargée de relents de mousson, avec des notes chaudes, terreuses et fruitées d’agrumes. Elle possède un goût doux-amer et elle est souvent utilisée comme garniture, d'une part parce que sa saveur n’est pas stable à la chaleur et qu’elle doit être ajoutée en fin de cuisson, d’autre part parce qu’elle possède d’utiles qualités modératrices.

It mentions specific undesirable odors like vinegar, roasted nuts, or burnt rubber which indicate wine spoilage. Wines served by the glass and exposed too long can taste flat or like a refrigerator, which are also signs of improper handling.\n\n2. **It is rare, but possible, for an error of service to ruin a bottle of wine.**\n   - This point addresses human errors in wine service, such as incorrect pouring or a damaged bottle. It suggests that in such cases, the sommelier should be informed and will rectify it by replacing the wine.\n\n3. **There is only one circumstance in which you should send wine back simply because it doesn’t suit your tastes.**\n   - It emphasizes that if a wine doesn't meet a diner's expectations due to faulty advice from the server or sommelier regarding taste preferences, the diner is justified in asking for an alternative. This stresses the responsibility of servers to inquire about preferences to better match the wine selection to the customer’s tastes."

Generally speaking, most wine glasses are designed and shaped scientifically to bring out the defining characteristics of the wine. The sip from a particularly shaped glass will help direct the wine to the important parts of the tongue and nose to taste and smell it.\n\nRed and white wines have glassware tailored accordingly, small narrow glasses are used to serve white wine and wider glasses are used to enjoy red wine. Wider glasses allow a lot of air to hug the surface of red wine to warm it and develop the flavor in the wine."

Volstead.\n\n### Impact on Wine Industry\n\n**Pre-Prohibition Era**\n- A golden age for wine in the U.S., notably unimpeded by European laws and led by ambitious immigrants.\n- The wine industry was marked by a vibrant, inclusive culture that competed internationally (e.g., 1900 Paris Exhibition).\n\n**During Prohibition**\n- Approximately 140 wineries remained, predominantly producing sacramental and kosher wines, along with medicinal \"tonics\".\n- Home winemaking and the use of intoxicating grapes for non-alcoholic purposes became common practices, often leading to illicit alcohol production.\n- Widespread increase in illegal activities, including the operation of *speakeasies* and a surge in organized crime related to alcohol.\n- Strong, fortified wines became more popular due to changes in consumer preferences and grape varieties.\n\n**Post-Prohibition Reactions**\n- Many vineyards were crippled and replaced with inferior grape varieties.\n- Not until 1967 did the taste for finer wines start to recover, leading to a resurgence in quality wine production in California.\n\n### Cultural Shifts\n\n**Prohibition's Unintended Consequences**\n- The creation of speakeasies introduced new social dynamics and reinforced hard drinking and clandestine behaviors.\n- The end of Prohibition left many newly formed habits and tastes unchanged, impacting future preferences for alcohol consumption in America.\n\n**Influence on Future Generations**\n- Iconic vintners like Robert Mondavi and Julio Gallo had to relearn and innovate winemaking techniques post-Prohibition by self-education, through reading and experimentation.\n\n**Concluding Insight**\n- This period underscored a significant adaptation within America's wine culture, showing both resilience and innovation in the face of stringent laws and social changes.\n\n---\n\nThe document encapsulates a comprehensive overview of the Prohibition era in the United States focusing on its profound impact on the country's wine culture. It outlines the legislations, societal shifts, and the enduring changes brought about in the wine industry as well as American society at large."
