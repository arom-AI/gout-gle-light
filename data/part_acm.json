Over the years, Oregon has shifted away from using California and France as models and has developed a new, independent approach that focuses on the unique demands of its terroir.\n\n3. **Quality of Wine:**\n   - This new approach and the adaptation to the geographic and climatic peculiarities have led to a significant improvement in the quality of Oregon wines, making them particularly noted for their beauty, focus, and finesse. Oregon Pinot Noir, in particular, is highlighted for its exceptional quality.\n\n4. **Regulations - The Ninety Percent Law:**\n   - Oregon enforces stricter wine regulations than the national standards set by U.S. law. The state requires that the leading Oregon wine types—Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Pinot Gris—must contain at least 90% of the grape variety named on the label, compared to the U.S. legal minimum of 75%.\n   - Exceptions to this rule include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, and several others, which need only 75% of the stated grape variety, allowing greater flexibility for blending.\n\nThe document emphasizes the adaptation and resilience of the Oregon wine industry, which has found its niche by leveraging its unique climate rather than relying on the wine production models of other regions."

You will find preserved and pickled lemon recipes throughout the Mideast and across southern Asia and India. There is really no clear progression of tastes here, just extremely concentrated flavor. The big elements are fruity tang, sweetness, the heat of the pepper, and strong spiced aromatic and floral herbal. It works well with grilled fish or in salads. It is particularly effective in moist toppings with nuts, shallots, dried tomatoes, olives, herbs, etc. Nice with roast fowl, for example our Poached and Crisped Turkey Leg Provençale (page 110).\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n- 10 lemons, halved and seeded (as best you can)\n- 1 stick cinnamon\n- 2 bay leaves\n- 1 teaspoon allspice (whole)\n- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds\n- 1 tablespoon white peppercorns\n- 3 cups water\n\nThe recipe summary and ingredients list from the image provide clear insight into the preparation of Pickled Lemon Confit, a dish noted for its bold and layered flavors ideal for enhancing other dishes."

    "contenu": "# THE D’OR IN CÔTE D’OR\n\n**The name Côte d’Or** is often translated as “golden slope,” perhaps because the wines from here cost a ransom, or perhaps because the vineyards turn golden in autumn. However, the term is actually a contraction of Côte d’Orient, “eastern-facing slope”—a reference to the fact that the vineyards face east to catch each day’s morning sun.\n\n## 7 In Terms of Sensory Characteristics\nBurgundies don’t lend themselves to quick evaluation. The wines are extremely elegant, highly nuanced, and often rather ethereal. They require a lot of concentration on the part of the taster. It’s not uncommon (even for professional tasters) to have to delve deep into their sensory aptitude in order to grasp each wine.\n\n## 8 Until the 1980s\nMost of the commerce in Burgundian wine was controlled by powerful brokers known as négociants. The négociants rose to power after the French Revolution, when fragmented ownership of small parcels of land in Burgundy made it economically and physically difficult for small growers to bottle, market, and sell their own wine.\n\nTraditionally, négociants bought (negotiated for) dozens if not hundreds of small lots of wine from numerous growers, then blended these lots into several wines, bottled them, and sold them under their own labels. A négociant house, such as Louis Jadot, would buy many tiny lots of Gevrey-Chambertin to bottle a Louis Jadot Gevrey-Chambertin, and many lots of Pommard to bottle a Louis Jadot Pommard. The négociant would, of course, also buy many lots of a Premier Cru vineyard. For example, Louis Jadot might buy several lots of the Premier Cru vineyard Les Amoureuses (the name means “the women in love”) and make a Louis Jadot Chambolle-Musigny “Les Amoureuses.” Generally speaking, the négociants of the past owned few—if any—vineyards themselves."

Of this total area, 97 percent (82,800 acres; 33,500 hectares) is already planted.

    "contenu": "Here's the structured content from the document titled \"WINE TASTING\":\n\n---\n\n### PERCEIVED DRYNESS OR SWEETNESS DOES NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH MEASUREMENTS OF SUGAR CONTENT.\n- **Explanation**: Wines cannot solely rely on sugar content labels to indicate style due to variations in how sugars and other components like alcohol influence perceived sweetness. Factors such as elevated acidity and carbonation can reduce sweetness perception, while elevated alcohol can enhance it. For instance, \"brut\" Champagne may taste dry despite having up to 15 grams of sugar per liter because other factors like less residual sugar in some wines can make them taste sweeter than they actually are.\n\n### SINCE THE DEGREE OF SWEETNESS IS CONTROLLED BY THE WINEMAKER, ANY GRAPE CAN BE MADE INTO EITHER A SWEET OR A DRY STYLE.\n- **Explanation**: The ability to control wine style through winemaking allows for diverse outputs from dry to sweet regardless of the grape type or origin. While certain wine regions and grape types have traditional associations with sweetness or dryness, these are based on tradition rather than inherent qualities of the grapes. For example, while Riesling from Germany and the U.S. might retain sweetness, those from Alsace and Australia are typically dry. Winemakers have the choice to either follow these traditional styles or deviate from them.\n\n### PERCEIVED SWEETNESS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME; AS WINES AGE, THEY WILL ALWAYS TASTE DRIER, NEVER SWEETER.\n- **Explanation**: As wines age, they naturally taste dryer even though the sugar content remains technically unchanged. Young wines usually exhibit more sweetness, which diminishes as the wine matures. This trend is emphasized in dessert wines, which, despite their high sugar content, will seem dryer over decades. Properly made dry wines also age well, showing improved characteristics over time.\n\n---\n\nThis document reflects different aspects of how sweetness in wine is perceived rather than being directly correlated to the measurable sugar content, emphasizing the influences of winemaking practices and aging processes."

Now, you may have yet to come across dark chocolate–covered, Sauternes-soaked raisins, and indeed there are only a scant few places (both in Paris) where you can get these little rubbins of hedonism. But get them you must. They will look innocent enough. But the minute you take a tiny bite and the mind-blowing flavor of Sauternes seeps into the luscious dark chocolate, well, this is when (as with everyone else who experiences them) your eyes will go wide and you momentarily won't know what to do with yourself. I have been told that Parisians think it's quite romantic to spend rainy mornings in bed, eating dark chocolate–covered Sauternes raisins with a loved one. You will have to test this for yourself.\n\nOnly a few confiserie (candy shops) in France sell chocolate-covered Sauternes, requiring that you keep a close lookout for the delicious nuggets when you are in that country. For decades, the best of these (and a temple of gastronomy for anyone with a sweet tooth) was L'Etoile d'Or, in Paris's 9th Arrondissement. (Alas, the historic shop closed in 2014 after a fire.) Today, luckily, a French shop called Oulala (sweet.oulala@gmail.com), sells them by mail order. Oulala indeed.\n\n### Wine Characteristics\n\nThese are not feeble wines. The sensory impact of a wine with 14 percent alcohol and 10 to 15 percent residual sugar is formidable. Plus, another factor comes into play: the botrytis itself. When the grapes being pressed have been perfectly infected, the mold, as well as the alcohol, can help kill the yeasts. As a result, the fermenting must may reach only 13 percent alcohol before the mold and alcohol working in tandem destroy the yeasts and cause fermentation to stop. At 13 percent alcohol, a sweet wine tastes more refined, elegant, and in balance than it does at a higher level of alcohol. Thus, with Sauternes and Barsac the finesse and complexity of the wines is directly related to how thoroughly and uniformly the botrytis takes hold in the vineyard.\n\n#### The Taste of Botrytis\n\nCan you taste botrytis in the wine? An experienced taster can. The mold is not washed off or in any other way removed from the grapes and bunches, and it does contribute to the flavor. That flavor, however, is not like something that was left too long in the back of the refrigerator. Botrytis adds an extra dimension, sometimes described as being faintly like sweet corn or mushrooms, to the overall complexity of the wines."

Below is an overview of the key contents structured into bullet points for clarity:\n\n1. **Secondary Fermentation Methods:**\n   - Traditional method (méthode traditionnelle), where wine undergoes fermentation in tanks before it is moved to bottles, filtering out yeast sediment.\n   - Continuous method, prevalent in modern production, involves using pressurized tanks with continual yeast addition.\n\n2. **Grape Varieties and Wine Labeling in Germany:**\n   - Common use of Riesling grapes.\n   - Sparkling wines often labeled as \"Sekt,\" which may come from any country but is inexpensive and primarily made in Germany.\n   - Quality labeled German sparkling wines are named Deutscher Sekt.\n\n3. **Winemaking Techniques:**\n   - Mention of wines that do not follow traditional methods, implying lesser quality.\n   - Avoid wines labeled as \"carbonated wine,\" which indicates lower standards enforced by U.S. regulations.\n\n4. **Vintner Choices Explained:**\n   - Emphasis on the timing of the grape picking, method of production, and style of wine.\n   - Variations like brut, blanc de blancs, rosé, and prestige cuvée.\n   - Influence of yeast contact time and sweetness level adjustments (dry, off-dry, sweet).\n\n5. **Importance of Grape Selection and Winemaking Decisions:**\n   - Grapes for sparkling wines are generally picked earlier than those needed for still wines to maintain high acidity levels, aimed at supporting the preservation of delicate flavors and a vibrant aftertaste.\n   - Primary fermentation and aging processes that determine the wine shadows (effect of less ripe grapes to control sugar and ultimately, alcohol content).\n\n6. **Preference and Influence of Méthode Champenoise or Traditionnelle:**\n   - Global emulation of this method due to its complexity and quality output.\n   - Typical blend includes Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, contributing varied flavors like spice and fruit (red flavors such as strawberry, raspberry, cherry) as well as structural acidity.\n\nThe document also references a table on principal wine-growing regions for sparkling wines located on pages 263-264, which seems to provide further detailed insight into regional production specifics."

It was my first look at Switzerland, my father's native land, a place I had never seen. It was so far off and exotic. We left the theater and walked through a street market. My mom, a brunette Irishwoman with a passion for decorating, painting, and interesting food, stopped at a market stall and got us pork from a Chinese vendor. It was pressed so thin you could almost see through it. It was barbecued with fragrant spices. I remember biting into it and tasting sweetness and the aroma of ground spices (although I couldn't identify the ingredients at the time). Something happened inside me. I loved the taste of that simple pork in the same way that I loved the songs that I had just heard Julie Andrews and her movie family sing for us. To me, that taste was music.\n\nI was beginning to learn the language of taste. My next strong food memory is about a year later. An Indian man, next to my father's silver-plating shop, made chapati—a kind of thin bread. He used his own mix of spices every day as he worked over his little outdoor stove. The way he handled and flipped and pressed the dough reminded me of a circus juggler. To me, the technique and the taste were inseparable.\n\nOften in those years my brothers and I would join my dad for an afternoon's fishing. Sometimes we would even catch fish! Grass carp, and little fish whose names we never knew, but which we would bring home and give to our gardener, who would grill them up with yet another mix of freshly ground ingredients from the spice stalls. By the time I was ten years old, my brothers and I knew and loved the spices and tastes of Asia. Then came a big change for our family as we pulled up stakes and moved across the globe to Switzerland. I felt cold air for the first time. I saw snow for the first time. It looked impossible and magical and wonderful.\n\nThey say that people learn languages most easily when they're young. With that move to Switzerland I began as a young boy to learn whole new languages of taste. Where many Europeans go to the East to discover new and exotic flavors, I found the flavors of Bern, my Swiss canton, as exotic as *The Tales of the Arabian Nights*. The cheeses with their aroma and textures captivated me."

Rehydrate the sea spaghetti in a large amount of water for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Strain and reserve the liquid. Trim the base of the enoki mushrooms.\n2. Organize rice, seaweeds, and mushrooms onto four large bowls. Lightly grill the nori leaves. Pour dashi heated to 80°C over it and allow to infuse for 2 minutes. Strain the mixture.\n3. Serve in bowls, season with grilled seaweed and sesame. Accompany with soy sauce.\n\n#### Tips:\n- **Bon à savoir (Good to Know):** Ochazuke is traditionally a Japanese dish concluded with a pour of tea or hot liquid over rice that can vary in its complexity. The version discussed here simplifies traditional elements but keeps the essence of discovering flavor through hot liquid ingredients.\n\n#### Related Techniques and References:\n- Review of dashi techniques on page 99\n- Make basic dashi, described on page 97\n- Prepare sushi rice as detailed on page 55\n\nThis recipe presents an innovative fusion approach, utilizing both traditional Japanese elements and adapting the process to fit a unique style of Ochazuke with sea spaghetti and enoki mushrooms."

It contrasts two types of mushrooms; one that grows in dark and humid conditions, and another that thrives on composted rice straw, highlighting issues in cultivation due to symbiotic relationships with trees.\n\n**Paragraph 2:**\nThis section explains the difficulties and expenses involved in cultivating mushrooms, truffles, and boletes, stating that only about a dozen types have been successfully cultivated out of an estimated 1,000 edible species.\n\n---\n\n**Subheading: THE STRUCTURE AND QUALITIES OF MUSHROOMS**\n\n**Paragraph 3:**\nMushrooms are distinguished from plants by the structure of their body, a majority of which is an underground network of fibers or hyphae, which gather nutrients and ramify through the soil. A cubic centimeter of soil can contain up to 2,000 meters/yards of hyphae.\n\n**Paragraph 4:**\nThe description continues about the fruiting body of mushrooms which play a crucial role in their reproduction and survival. It also touches on the risks associated with wild mushrooms, including potential toxicity, exemplified by the gyromitrin in Gyromitra species.\n\n**Paragraph 5:**\nThe composition of mushrooms is detailed, emphasizing their high water content but much richer in protein and vitamin B12 than most other fresh produce. The mushrooms' cell walls are composed of chitin rather than plant cellulose, which offers certain structural benefits.\n\n---\n\n**Illustration Description:**\nThe figure illustrates the anatomy of a mushroom showing different parts such as gills, spores, and hyphae, with a note explaining how the hyphae function as nutrient-gathering threads that push the mushroom's fruiting body through the soil surface to disperse spores.\n\n---\n\nThis structured content captures the educational and informative tone of the original document, clearly conveying information about the growth, structure, and biological composition of mushrooms."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the pairing of Barbera wine with various food items. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Introduction**: It notes that in Piedmont, Barbera can be initially accompanied by courses such as antipasti, pasta, etc., before switching to other wine styles like Barolo or Barbaresco. The frizzante styles, while hard to find, are mentioned as good companions to rich food.\n\n2. **Comparison with Sangiovese**: Barbera is characterized as an essential wine for pairing with \"red\" sauces, due to its high acidity, which is essential when pairing with tomato-based sauces. The bright fruit taste of Barbera enhances the flavors of dishes, adding a \"pop.\"\n\n3. **Food Pairing Options**:\n   - It can pair well with dishes from veal chops to grilled halibut, and from simple roast lamb to mixed antipasti.\n   - Especially noted are its pairings with grilled portobello mushrooms, char siu (roast pork), tandoori chicken, or Vietnamese shaking beef.\n   - Suggested as an option with pizza, emphasizing that few wines are better partnered with pizza or even burritos.\n\n4. **Unique Affinity with Mushrooms**: The wine is said to have a special affinity with mushrooms from Piedmont's truffles. The document suggests sautéing them and serving them over pasta, steak, or on toasted slices of bread like crostini.\n\n5. **Seasoning**: When paired with more traditional or earthy wines, it's suggested to add a bit of garlic or herbs to bond the flavors together.\n\n6. **Wine Characteristics**:\n   - Modern-style bottlings can be quite oaky, which should be a consideration when pairing with food.\n   - If the wine is smoky and sweet, it works well with mesquite or other charcoal-grilled foods. \n   - Barbera can vary in its finish based on the characteristics derived from oak aging.\n\n7. **Pairing Pointers Summary**:\n   - **Comfort Foods**: Barbera pairs well with burgers, pizzas, meat loaves, and burritos.\n   - **Charcuterie**: It matches well with northern Italian staples like salami, soppressata, mortadella, bologna, prosciutto, and lardo, and complements French pâté and terrines.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Suggested with a range from morels to portobellos, and can be tossed with veal chops, burgers, and in risotto.\n   - **Fish**: The wine’s high acid, low tannins, and balanced flavors make it suitable for grilled tuna, swordfish, and potentially even shark. Adds that adding a tomato vinaigrette or basic puttanesca enhances the pairing.\n\nThe document overall affirms the versatility of Barbera wine in enhancing the flavors of a wide variety of dishes, highlighting its adaptability across different cuisines and preparations."
