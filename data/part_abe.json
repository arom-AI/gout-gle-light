In general, it involves the following:\n- **HARVESTING THE WINE** in small lots and then making each lot separately\n- **USING INDIGENOUS YEASTS** (that is, not adding commercial yeasts)\n- **BARREL FERMENTATION OF WHITE WINES**\n- **MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION OF WHITE WINES**\n- **LONG LEES CONTACT** (*sur lie*) and stirring of the lees (*bâtonnage*) of white wines\n- **SMALL, OPEN-TOPPED FERMENTERS** for red wine\n- **VERY GENTLE** and minimal handling of the wine after it is made\n- **FINING WITH CASEIN OR ISINGLASS** for chardonnay; egg whites for pinot noir\n- **FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF AGING** in small oak barrels, usually not 100 percent new\n\nWhy go to the added trouble and expense of making, aging, bottling, marketing, and selling multiple pinot noirs when you could blend them together and make just one pinot noir, as much of the rest of the world does? It’s a matter of philosophy and purpose. For wines above the level of basic Bourgogne, the Burgundian grower’s goal is to let the personality of the place emanate through the wine. Making one large blend would obliterate the differences in flavor and aroma derived from place. Still, it’s a decision with practical consequences, for vineyard parcels can be tiny. It is not unusual for a grower to own just a few rows of vines, enough perhaps to make but a single barrel (twenty-five cases) of wine from that appellation.\n\n**Caption:**  \nThe \"backyard\" of pinot noir vines behind Domaine de L'Arlot in Nuits-St.-Georges. Below the house are some of the most enchanting old cellars in the village."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the concept of \"volume\" in culinary terms, describing how the intensity level of an ingredient's flavor impacts a dish and how different volumes are used to create distinct outcomes in cooking. The document explains \"volume\" using an analogy to a stereo dial, where \"1\" represents a mild flavor and \"10\" represents a very strong flavor. The significance of achieving the appropriate balance of flavor volume in cooking is emphasized.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the document's structured information:\n\n### Volume\nThe section explains that the \"volume\" of an ingredient refers to the intensity of its flavor, comparing it to settings on a stereo. Mild seasonings like chopped parsley are likened to a low volume, whereas strong flavors like habanero chiles resemble a high volume. The importance of balancing these volumes in a dish to maintain harmony and avoid overpowering flavors is highlighted.\n\n### Considerations\nThe document stresses the importance of not allowing a dish to become so over-spiced that the essence of the ingredients cannot be tasted.\n\n### Proteins (by Volume)\n- **Light and/or quiet:** fish, shellfish, tofu\n- **Medium and/or moderate:** white meat (chicken, pork, veal)\n- **Heavy and/or loud:** red meat (beef, lamb, venison)\n\n### Cooking Techniques (by Volume)\n- **Light and/or quiet:** poaching, steaming\n- **Medium and/or moderate:** frying, sautéing\n- **Heavy and/or loud:** braising, stewing\n\nThe document includes an image of a dish that serves as a visual context for discussing how volume considerations apply in practical cooking settings."

Below, I've structured the content into headers from the text and provided a summarized content description under each.\n\n### Abundant Meat in North America\n- **Historical context and development**: The text discusses how meat consumption in America has been possible due to the continent's richness and the urbanization in the 19th century. Techniques like barreling meats and the development of transportation (railroads and refrigerated rail cars by Gustavus Swift and Philip Armour) helped distribute fresh beef.\n- **Current perspective**: It mentions that presently the United States consumes a large proportion of the world's meat, highlighting the efficiency and nutritional comparison of animal flesh to plant protein, emphasizing that feeding livestock is less efficient than plant crops.\n\n### Why Do People Love Meat?\n- **Cultural and biological factors**: The section discusses why eating meat is deeply ingrained in human culture and tradition, stemming from survival instincts and the nutritional benefits that were important in the evolutionary past.\n- **Biological details**: It explains how meat provides essential nutrients quickly, as cells in animal meat—despite being biochemically fragile—are rich in essential proteins, fats, and other micronutrients critical for human health.\n\n### Food Words: Animals and Their Meats\n- **Etymological aspects of meat terms**: This part provides an insight into how the English vocabulary around meat was influenced by the Norman Conquest in 1066, leading to a distinction between the names of animals and the meat derived from them (e.g., cow and beef, pig and pork).\n  \nOverall, the document addresses both the historical and contemporary aspects of meat consumption, exploring its biological, nutritional, cultural, and linguistic dimensions."

It is divided into two main sections that talk about grape types and specific wine regions.\n\n### WHITES\n- **Chardonnay**: Considered the leading white grape in terms of potential. The wines made from it range in quality from good to very good.\n- **Pinot Gris**: The leading white grape in terms of production. It is a white variant of pinot noir, generally made into popular, easy-to-like crisp whites.\n- **Riesling**: An up-and-coming white, mostly made into light, fresh, dry wines, but also includes sweet dessert rieslings.\n\n### REDS\n- **Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Merlot**: These are minor grapes in Oregon, grown in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Their success depends heavily on mesoclimates and producers.\n- **Pinot Noir**: The most prestigious grape in Oregon. Nearly every winery in Willamette Valley grows it, resulting in aromatic, elegant, earthy wines with supple textures.\n\n### REGIONS\n- **McMinnville**: Located just west of the famous wine town of McMinnville, the AVA experiences a relatively warm and dry climate due to its position in a rain shadow of the Coast Range. The area has shallow, uplifted marine sedimentary soils.\n- **Ribbon Ridge**: The smallest of the AVAs, nested within the Chehalem Mountains. It has old silty/clay sedimentary soils, well protected by geographical features which contribute to a moderate climate.\n- **Yamhill-Carlton**: This AVA encompasses the hamlets of Yamhill and Carlton, residing on coarse-grained, ancient marine sedimentary soils. Known producers include Shea, Soter, Penner-Ash, and Elk Cove. Louis Jadot, a Burgundy firm that bought vineyard land in 2013, is highlighted as a producer to watch.\n\nThe document gives a concise overview of various grape types and key wine-producing areas in Oregon, emphasizing the unique characteristics and strengths of each."

This is typically visualized under a light source such as a candle or flashlight during the decanting process.\n  - **To aerate a young wine**: Aerating young wine is another common reason for decanting, enhancing its flavor and aroma. This includes red and white wines and can be done simply using a carafe.\n\n- **Recommendation for Decanting**:\n  - Decant the wine far enough in advance to enjoy its benefits, generally fifteen to thirty minutes prior to drinking.\n\n### Glassware\n- **Variety of Glassware**:\n  - The average person need not own a diverse array of glassware for different types of wine. However, certain styles and sizes can enhance the enjoyment of wine.\n  \n- **Suggested Glassware**:\n  - **White Wine Glasses**: Small assortment suggested; white wine glasses, different glasses for older and younger reds, and smaller glasses for dessert wine.\n  - **All-Purpose Glass**: Should have a long stem, a bowl of about five to six fingers’ height tapering toward the rim, capacity of eleven to fifteen ounces for whites, fifteen to twenty-three ounces for reds.\n    - For whites: Select a ten- to fifteen-ounce all-purpose glass.\n    - For reds: Select a glass with a capacity of fifteen to twenty-three ounces.\n  - **Champagne Flutes**: Tall with a slightly tapered sheer rim and a capacity of six to nine ounces.\n  - **Dessert Wine Glasses**: Smaller all-purpose glasses with a tapered, sheer rim and a capacity of about eight ounces.\n\n### The 20/20 Rule\n- **Wine Temperature Adjustment**:\n  - Proposed by Leslie Sbrocco as the 20/20 rule:\n    - **White Wine**: Pull any young white wine from the fridge twenty minutes before you intend to open it.\n    - **Red Wine**: Pull any young red wine out of the fridge twenty minutes before opening, and for older wines, wait until closer to serving time to pull them out, allowing them to reach a more suitable temperature.\n\n---"

The organ of smell is located in the top part of the nose, using molecules that dissolve in mucous and activate olfactory cells either through direct nasal (inhaled through nostrils) or retro-nasal pathways (from the back of the mouth).\n- The brain records the stimulation and compares it to a repertoire learned through training to estimate the wine's aromatic intensity.\n\n**Levels of aroma intensity in wines**:\n- **Minimal aroma**: Quiet and closed wines that haven't released their aromatic potential.\n- **Medium intensity**: Wines with a singular, moderate scent.\n- **Strong aroma**: Aromatic wines offering multiple scents.\n- **Complex and refined**: Wines where aromas unfold progressively, described metaphorically as a wine \"lining up like a peacock's tail\".\n\n**Classification of odors**:\n- The human nose can detect around 10,000 different odors. Wines generally fall into one of eleven aromatic families:\n  1. Animal\n  2. Balsamic\n  3. Woody\n  4. Chemical\n  5. Etheric\n  6. Spicy\n  7. Emphyreumatic (related to the smell of burning substances)\n  8. Floral\n  9. Fruity\n  10. Mineral\n  11. Vegetal\n\n#### Visuals in the document\n\n**First Image**:\n- Diagram illustrating the nasal and retro-nasal pathways for scents during wine tasting, titled \"L'examen olfactif : le méchanisme de l'odorat.\"\n\n**Second Image**:\n- Artistic representation of different types of wines labeled with various aromatic families, titled \"L'examen olfactif : la classification des odeurs.\"\n\n#### Additional Elements\n\n**Slide marker**:\n- The text \"Diapo x: L'examen olfactif\" implies this page may be part of a slide presentation format for wine education.\n\nThis breakdown should facilitate a clearer understanding and application of the sensory analysis techniques discussed in the document."

These organisms are fundamentally driven to consume and reproduce through a cycle where they eat sugar, which provides the energy they need to reproduce. However, the byproduct of their metabolism becomes toxic to them once wine alcohol levels reach 15 to 16 percent, impeding their survival.\n\n### GRAPES ARE IDEALLY SUITED FOR WINEMAKING BECAUSE THEY ARE SWEET, FLAVORFUL, AND JUICY.\n- **Attributes of Grapes**: Grapes are particularly rich in fermentable sugars like glucose and fructose, which makes them excellent for producing high-alcohol content wines. Historically, grapes were selected over other fruits like strawberries for fermentation because they create stronger wine that is nutritious, resists spoilage, and enhances flavors due to higher alcohol levels.\n\n### GRAPE JUICE MAY BE SUGARY, BUT MOST WINES ARE DRY, A WINE TERM MEANING “NOT PERCEPTIBLY SWEET.”\n- **Wine Sweetness**: During winemaking, yeasts metabolize the sugar in grape juice until there's none left, akin to an engine running out of fuel. Initially very sweet, with around 20 percent sugar content, the finished wine often contains so little sugar (usually less than 1 percent) that it is undetectable to the taste. This state is referred to as dryness and represents a lack of sweetness. The leftover sugar content, or residual sugar, is measured in grams per liter or by percentage weight and is often minimal in completed wines.\n\nThis structured extraction breaks down the major points and details about yeasts, grapes, and the process of wine becoming 'dry' from the original document."

    "contenu": "### ZINFANDEL\n\n**Overview**:\nZinfandel is a type of grape and wine that has been a significant part of Californian viticulture. It was the most widely planted grape in California until 1998, when it was surpassed by cabernet sauvignon. Known for its versatility and rich flavors, zinfandel has had a dynamic history and continues to be popular, albeit in different styles.\n\n**History and Characteristics**:\n- **Originally Planted**: Zinfandel was first planted in California in the 1830s.\n- **Origin**: DNA typing in the 1990s revealed zinfandel is genetically identical to the Croatian grape \"crljenak kaštelanski\", historically known as \"tribidrag\".\n- **Production Start in California**: The production of the first white zinfandel (actually a light pink wine) was done by Sutter Home Winery in 1972.\n- **Distinct Traits**: It is known for being a robust, rustic wine. True zinfandel is described as a soft-textured dry red wine with flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, and plummy fruit.\n- **Popularity**: White zinfandel eventually began to outsell the traditional red zinfandel and remains more popular. This variety is generally mass-produced using less-than-top-quality grapes, slightly sweet, and is considered suitable for those new to wine tasting.\n\n**Cultural Significance**:\n- **Popularity in California**: Since its introduction, zinfandel has been embraced and continues to play a key role in California’s wine scene. Sutter Home's innovations with white zinfandel have notably influenced the market.\n- **Global Identity**: In Apulia, Italy, the same grape is known as \"primitivo\".\n- **Legacy**: For over 65 years, Sutter Home has been instrumental in popularizing and nurturing the growth of zinfandel in California.\n\n**Consumer Information**:\n- **Winery Visit**: Sutter Home Winery remains open to visitors offering complimentary tastings.\n- **Recommendation**: While the white version is seen as a beginner's introduction to wine, true red zinfandel offers depth for more earnest wine enthusiasts. \n\nThis comprehensive overview encapsulates the rich history and ongoing evolution of the zinfandel grape in both its red and white forms, noting its origin, characteristics, and stature within the wine industry."

Below, I've organized the content under headings and subheadings to reflect the structured content of the document.\n\n---\n\n### EGG–LIQUID MIXTURES\n\n#### Cooking Custards\n- **Temperature and Cooking Method**:\n  Cooks have recognized the importance of low cooking temperatures for thousands of years, especially for custards to prevent them from toughening quickly. Custards are suggested to be baked in a moderate oven protected by a water bath which keeps the cooking temperature below boiling.\n\n- **Unmolding and Cooling**:\n  Custards firm up as they cool, particularly those made in a buttered ramekin. The document notes that cooling helps the custard's proteins to firm up more evenly.\n\n- **Handling Fruits and Vegetables**:\n  The text mentions that custard mixed with fruits or vegetables can be uneven due to the fluid they release. Precooking the fruits or vegetables and adding some flour to the mix can help bind excess liquid and prevent over-coagulation.\n\n- **Water Bath Importance**:\n  Using a water bath is crucial as it protects custard from boiling, therefore it should not be mistaken for increasing the water temperature to the point of boiling. Overcooking risks can further be assessed by carefully monitoring if custard slightly wobbles in the center, indicating it is done but still soft.\n\n- **Custard Doneness**:\n  The document indicates that custard doneness can be judged by probing with a toothpick or knife to see if it's set but slightly underdone.\n\n#### “Ribboning” Yolks with Sugar\n- **Common Misconceptions**:\n  It is a common belief that beating yolks with sugar until they lighten and thicken is crucial. However, the text argues that this does not significantly impact the yolk components but merely shows that sugar is dissolved. The actual quality of the custard won't significantly decrease if you stop beating before reaching the ribbon stage.\n\n---\n\nThis sectioning covers the major topics discussed in the provided text, each highlighting specific techniques and considerations for making custards and similar egg-based mixtures."

Rosé d’Anjou is usually low in alcohol (often no more than 11.5 percent) and ever so slightly “tender,” as the locals say (meaning it has 1 to 1.5 percent residual sugar). It’s usually made primarily from the local red grolleau grape, although five other red grapes can be part of the blend: gamay, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, côt (aka malbec), and pineau d’Aunis.\n\nA curious version of rosé d’Anjou is rosé Cabernet d’Anjou—made solely from cabernet franc or cabernet sauvignon. Although the thought of cabernet is appealing, a rosé with green flavors (a characteristic of cabernet) is something of an acquired taste. To counterbalance the “gherkin” effect, more residual sugar is left in rosé cabernet d’Anjou than in rosé d’Anjou.\n\n*Caption under image:*\nWines from two of the great sweet wine appellations of the Loire: Coteaux de L'Aubance and Quarts de Chaume."

At the time, it was highly unusual for an American vineyard to be well known, especially one in the Santa Maria Valley of Santa Barbara County (itself not well known then). But the name Bien Nacido, which means “well born,” said it all. Indeed, it seemed like a majority of the greatest wines coming out of Santa Barbara County all had the words Bien Nacido Vineyards on their labels. The sloped vineyard, with panoramic views facing southwest, had been planted in 1973 by a multigenerational farming family named Miller. It was a huge vineyard—600 acres (240 hectares) of mostly chardonnay, pinot noir, and syrah—divided into small blocks that were named alphabetically. Winemakers, then and now, contracted for the fruit by specific rows of grapes. In 2007, after nearly thirty-five years of custom farming, the family decided to make their own wines as well. Bien Nacido pinot noir from Bien Nacido Vineyards (eight rows from Q block) is classically *bien nacido*: elegant and sumptuous."

This elevation is said to result not just from the food and drink itself but also from every aspect of the dining experience, including the ambiance and service. The aim is to enrich the entire dining experience with pleasure, comfort, interest, and meaning.\n\n**Choosing a Cooking Technique with Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern in New York City**\n\nMichael Anthony discusses the principles of choosing a cooking technique. He emphasizes the goal of maximizing the inherent flavor and quality of ingredients, which aligns with the philosophy of progressive modern kitchens. Despite the use of advanced techniques like sous vide (cooking vacuum-packed ingredients at low temperatures for extended periods), Anthony and his team strive to hold onto traditional cooking principles, focusing on the best methods to preserve and enhance flavors.\n\nAlice Waters is mentioned as someone who views sous vide cooking as reducing food to \"dead\" ingredients, lacking the fresh crunch and emotional connection of traditional cooking. However, sous vide, as explained, involves slow cooking processes ideal for tougher cuts of meat, aiming to transform them into flavorful dishes.\n\nAnthony personally values simplicity and straightforwardness in cooking. He enjoys meals that have a clear and memorable flavor profile, which he recalls better than those that are technically complex but less impactful in taste. He values the moments and distinctiveness of the meals enjoyed at home, which though less complicated, often leave a more memorable impression."

    "contenu": "The document has three main sections, each detailing different aspects and methods of ice preparation. Here's the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n### PUNCH ICE\n\nOur communal punches are served with one large puck of ice frozen in a round plastic pint container (the same type you often get when you order take-out). At home, any small, clean bowl or plastic food storage container will do the trick. For certain punches, we throw fresh fruit into the container and freeze it in the ice. This is a beautiful addition to any punch, especially if you use raspberries.\n\n---\n\n### MAKING ICE AT HOME\n\nProducing ice can be as simple as filling your desired ice tray with tap water and sticking it in the freezer. If your tap water isn’t good, use bottled or purified water. Over time, the ice in your freezer will absorb flavors from any other food nearby, so cover your ice trays with plastic wrap or dedicate your freezer to only making ice. (It’s all about priorities.)\n\nHowever, homemade freezer ice will probably be cloudy due to dissolved gases in the water. If you want to make clearer ice, boil the water first to release any dissolved gases. Place boiled water into ice molds inside the freezer while still hot. Aside from cosmetics, clear ice is denser and more structurally sound, so it will break apart less quickly than cloudy ice when shaken.\n\n---\n\n### MAKING ICE FROM BIG BLOCKS\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to procure a large block of ice (from a frozen lake, perhaps, or a commercial ice company), you can cut it down into any desired shape and size. Or you can make your own block of ice by filling a small cooler with hot water and placing it in the freezer, uncovered. The insulated sides will force the ice to slowly freeze from the surface downward. After a couple of days, you’ll have a large block of crystal clear ice with a cloudy layer of trapped gases on the bottom, which can be chipped off.\n\nTo break down a large block of ice, use a serrated knife that you don’t care too much about (chipping ice will quickly dull the teeth). Let the ice sit at room temperature for a few minutes. (If you start hacking it up right away, the ice will shatter into shards.) Score one side of the block until you have a ⅛-inch-deep depression before cutting off slices.\n\n---"

The document explains both the historical and practical aspects of barrel usage and highlights the influence of barrels on wine:\n\n---\n\n## European Wine Making and Barrel Usage\n\nEuropean winemakers have historically utilized barrels in varying sizes for the fermentation and storage of wine, adapting to modern needs with larger stainless-steel tanks as winemaking scales increased. Through continuous comparison, the precise effects of oak barrels on wine were understood.\n\n## Key Points on Oak Barrel Effects on Wine\n\n### Oak Influences on Wine:\n- **Aromatic Contribution**: Oak barrels can impart diverse aromatic qualities to wine, including distinctive sweet and creamy nuances. These nuances are derived from vanillin in oak and its reaction to the charring process during barrel making, which also influences flavors of coconut, toast, coffee, cloves, smoke, cedar, and tobacco.\n\n### Porosity and Storage:\n- **Air and Moisture Exchange**: Due to their porosity, oak barrels allow air in and wine out, leading to a slow process of oxidation and evaporation. This porosity significantly impacts red wines by softening their profiles through the ingress of oxygen and slow evaporation of water and alcohol, concentrating the wine flavors.\n\n### Varietal Considerations:\n- **Adaptation to Varietals**: Red wines often benefit from and sometimes require oak treatment more than white wines. Barrel maturation enhances the mellowness in reds such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, while the choice of oak use in white wines depends on their need for flavor enhancement, with neutral grapes like Chardonnay adapting well to oak infusion, unlike aromatic varieties such as Riesling.\n\nThe page also indicates this is from a section titled \"WINE BASICS,\" page 33, suggesting it is part of a larger educational material on wine."

It became a place of amazing geologic and climatic diversity. Almost every kind of climate, land formation, vegetation, and animal life that can be found anywhere else in the United States can be found in California. Much of the state, however, is either too bone-chillingly cold or too torridly hot to be ideal for wine grapes. Close to the 840-mile-long (1,350-kilometer) Pacific coastline, people often wear goose-down jackets in the summer. Eighty miles (130 kilometers) inland, the immense, oval cradle of the Central Valley can be as blistering as an oven. Most of the top wine regions are poised between these two extremes — close enough to the ocean to benefit from its cooling effects, yet inland enough to benefit from the warmth needed for ripening. Thus, the major wine regions are stacked, one on top of the other, up and down the length of the state, from Santa Barbara County in the south to Mendocino in the north."

For most wine drinkers, such enjoyment is more than enough. But it’s true that enjoyment unexamined doesn’t help us learn. The next day we’ll remember only that we liked the wine, but not why. To become a better taster, the first step is to develop a consistent approach.\n\nBecause our senses fluctuate as widely as our emotions, wine will taste different under varied circumstances; for example, we enjoy a wine more if we’re on vacation than if we have to work the next day. Humans are such variable beings that we need a methodology to clearly observe wines and compare them in the same light. Approaching every wine consistently—assessing the same characteristics—allows us to mentally file it within a larger context. Our mental checklist prompts us to look for, and therefore remember, distinctive qualities.\n\n**Professionals evaluate wine one sense at a time.** We begin with how a wine looks in the glass before moving on to how it smells. From there we take a sip, which allows us to note both how it tastes and how it feels in the mouth. Lastly, we observe how wine components resonate after swallowing.\n\n---\n\n**RICHARD BETTS** is a master sommelier, one of only a handful to pass the rigorous examination on the first attempt. During his tenure as wine director for Aspen’s premier restaurant Montagna at The Little Nell, Betts built one of the country’s most ambitious wine programs. In 2008 he passed on the reins at Montagna to set out on the next phase of his career: becoming a vintner and winemaker, with the help of partner Dennis Scholl. Together they launched Betts and Scholl, making wines from around the world in partnership with some of the globe’s top growers."
