    "contenu": "### Portugal\n\n**Portugal has a wealth of local grape varieties, which produce wines in a range of styles. The reds can be supple and fruity or full-bodied and high in tannins, whereas the whites are usually refreshing and best drunk young.**\n\n#### Climate\nDespite the fact that it is only a small country, Portugal has a range of different climates. The single most important influence is that of the Atlantic Ocean, and much of the country has a maritime climate. However, in many of the inland vineyards the climate is hot, dry and continental. In some regions altitude can help to mitigate the very high temperatures. The large differences in annual average temperature partly account for the diversity of wine styles found in Portugal.\n\n#### Regions and Wines\nPortugal has a wealth of indigenous varieties that provide a point of difference from many other wine-producing countries. This can also make the wines of Portugal rather difficult to understand, particularly as many of the same grape varieties have different names in different regions. Consequently, here we focus on the five main DOCs as well as the largest Vinho Regional and the principal styles of wines made there.\n\n#### Vinho Verde\nVinho Verde is in the north-west of Portugal; its nearness to the Atlantic Ocean means it has a moderate maritime climate. The most significant feature of the climate is the high annual rainfall. Without careful canopy management in the vineyard, the high levels of precipitation can lead to excessive canopy growth and encourage disease. The modernisation of the vineyards in the Vinho Verde region has meant a move away from the traditional pergola trellising. Spur-pruned VSP, to create airflow in the humid environment, is now used to improve the health and quality of the grapes and allow for mechanisation. The classic white Vinho Verde wines are pale lemon colored, high in acidity and low in alcohol (8% to 11.5% abv). The wines with lower alcohol are usually off-dry in style. If a grape variety, a sub-region or an authorised quality labelling term is mentioned on the label, the wine can have up to 14% abv. The white wines are made from local grape varieties such as Loureiro and Arinto. Traditionally, these wines have a slight sparkling sensation that enhances their freshness. Vinho Verde Alvarinho is made entirely from Alvarinho grapes (Albariño in Spain) grown in the small designated sub-region of Monção e Melgaço. It has slightly higher alcohol (11.5% to 14% abv) and riper, more tropical aromas.\n\n#### Portuguese Wine Laws\n- **PDO (Denominação de Origem Protegida):** The Portuguese term for PDO is Denominação de Origem Protegida, but the traditional term Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) is also widely used.\n- **PGI (Indicação Geográfica Protegida):** The Portuguese PGI is Indicação Geográfica Protegida (IGP) but the traditional term Vinho Regional is still seen on wine labels.\n\nTable wines without geographical indication are labeled as Vinho (Wine). Over the years, Portugal has had considerable success with simple, fruity off-dry rosé wines that fall into this category."

Be patient; sometimes the kombucha mother eventually floats to the top.\n  2. If it doesn’t, a thin film might form signaling a new mother is being created.\n- **Outcome:** If the mother remains sunk and does not lead to the formation of a new layer or film, it is considered non-viable for further use.\n- **Solution:** Convert the sunk mother to nata candy, find another mother, or add mature kombucha to the existing mix to facilitate new mother formation.\n\n## Straining bread for kvass is difficult\n\n**Process and Challenges:** \n- **Key Challenge:** Squeezing out all liquid absorbed by the bread during kvass making.\n- **Method:** Use a colander lined with cheesecloth to strain the bread-water solution.\n- **Tediousness:** Each straining session involves packing the bread, twisting the cheesecloth, and kneading the bread ball to extract maximum liquid.\n- **Repeat:** The process must be repeated multiple times to effectively use all bread."

Here's an organized summarization of the content:\n\n### Beverages Derived from Corn and Sorghum: Cultural and Historical Perspectives\n\n#### Tesguino\n- **Cultural Variation**: The preparation of tesguino varies among different ethnic groups, according to Steinkraus. Bennett and Zinng also observed differences in tesguino's taste across different regions.\n- **Botanical Additives**: Variance exists in the use of botanical additions in tesguino across different groups.\n- **Historical Adaptation**: Over time, practices evolve as each generation modifies them under new conditions. For traditions to stay relevant, adaptation is necessary.\n\n#### Origin of Corn Fermentation\n- **Primary Corn Ferment**: Tesguino might be the original corn ferment, believed to be made from the sap of fresh, green cornstalks before corn was used as grain.\n- **Anthropological Theories**: Anthropologists, including John Smalley and Michael Blake, suggest that corn was initially domesticated for beverage production rather than food. They hypothesize early maize-based beverages were derived from sweet stalks rather than the grains.\n- **Development of Maize**: The theory suggests that early Maize domestication in Mexico involved practices like casually harvesting the sweet stalks and chewing them, leading to later fermentation practices and cultivation that enhanced maize's fruit size (ear and kernels).\n\n#### Importance of Cultural and Historical Continuity\n- **Persistence of Traditions**: Emphasizes the importance of continuous use and adaptation of traditional practices to prevent them from fading into oblivity.\n\n#### Sorghum Beer\n- **Cultural Staple**: Sorghum beer is a traditional beverage across much of Africa, known for its homemade quality and complex flavor, which blends sweet, alcoholic, and sour notes."

It notes that most people respond positively to added complexity to a point, after which interest declines.\n\n2. **Aromatic complexity**\n   - Explains that aromatic complexity is not just about the number of different ingredients used, but how these ingredients harmonize in various forms on the plate. For example, although Groups C, G, or I ingredients have common molecules, they form different aromatic complexities.\n\n3. **Optimizing complexity**\n   - Advises starting with no more than five ingredients when learning to work with aromas to maintain balance and refinement. It delves into how total number of different aroma molecules, their type, similarities among them, and their contribution to taste influence dish complexity.\n\n4. **Group A-E Overview**:\n   - **Group A**: Contains ingredients with strong aromatic links like chocolate, caramel, and coffee all containing roasted, caramellic, and nutty notes. It uses the term 'overtoning' to describe unnecessary variation that complicates a dish.\n   - **Group B**: Examines the effects of adding contrasting ingredients like almonds and basil, which increase complexity by offering diverse tasting and textural experiences.\n   - **Group C**: Lists ingredients similar to chocolate but varying in somatic qualities; they add variety in terms of flavor and appearance.\n   - **Group D**: Discusses ingredients like chicken, chili, chocolate, anise, and peanuts, each markedly different from the others, adding to the dish's complexity.\n   - **Group E**: Focuses on traditional Mexican dish called \"mole de pollo\", illustrating how different configurations of similar components lead to diverse perceptions of complexity among people.\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Touches on the human penchant for complexity and familiarity in food, mentioning how these aspects adhere to the psychological principle of \"unity-in-variety\", which aids in processing complex but familiar elements in a pleasurable manner.\n\nThis summary captures the essence and distinct subtopics the document covers regarding the complexity in culinary preparation and perception."

This transformation indicates the temperature range suitable for different types of candy.\n- During cooking, most of the heating contributes to evaporating water, causing the syrup temperature to rise only gradually until the sugar concentration passes 80%. After this point, since there is less water, the temperature of the syrup and its boiling point rise more rapidly.\n- To prevent browning or scorching of the sugar, the heat should be reduced towards the end of cooking and the syrup temperature monitored closely.\n\n**Section on Sugar Structure: Cooling and Crystallization:**\n- The final texture of candy depends on whether the sugar in the syrup forms few large crystals or many small ones. Large crystals lead to a coarse and grainy texture, whereas many small crystals create a smoother texture.\n\n**Table on Confections and Their Corresponding Sugar Syrups:**\n\n| Syrup Behavior in Cold-Water Test | Syrup Boiling Point °F/°C | Confection                 |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Thread                           | 215–235/102–113           | Syrups, preserves          |\n| Soft ball                        | 235–240/113–116           | Fondant, fudge             |\n| Firm ball                        | 245–250/118–121           | Caramel candies            |\n| Hard ball                        | 240–265/121–130           | Marshmallows, nougat       |\n| Soft crack                       | 270–290/132–143           | Taffy                      |\n| Hard crack                       | 300–310/149–154           | Butterscotch, brittle      |\n|                                  | 320–335/160–168           | Hard candies, toffee       |\n|                                  | 340/170                   | Light caramel for syrups, color, and flavor |\n|                                  | 355–360/180–182           | Spun sugar, sugar cages; medium caramel |\n|                                  | 375–380/188–190           | Dark caramel               |\n|                                  | 410/205                   | Black caramel              |\n\n**Note:**\n- At temperatures above 330°F/165°C, when the sugar syrup is more than 99% sucrose, it begins to break down and caramelize.

    "contenu": "### SUGARS, CHOCOLATE, AND CONFECTIONERY\n\n#### Modeling Chocolate\n**Modeling** or **molding** chocolate is a version made expressly for shaping into decorations. It's made by mixing molten chocolate with a third to half its weight of corn syrup and sugar, then kneading the mixture into a pliable mass. The resulting “chocolate” is now a concentrated sugar syrup that is filled and thickened with cocoa particles and droplets of cocoa butter. The pieces stiffen as the syrup phase loses moisture to the air and to the dry cocoa particles.\n\n#### Chocolate and Health\n\n- **Fats and Antioxidants:** Cocoa beans, like all seeds, are rich in nutrients that support the plant embryo until it develops leaves and roots. They're especially rich in saturated fats, which are notorious for contributing to raised blood cholesterol levels and therefore to the risk of heart disease. However, much of the saturated fat in cocoa butter is a particular fatty acid that the body immediately converts into an unsaturated one (stearic acid is converted to oleic acid). So chocolate is not thought to pose a risk to the heart. In fact, it may well be beneficial. Cocoa particles are a tremendously rich source of antioxidant phenolic compounds, which account for 8% of the weight of cocoa powder. The higher the cocoa solids content of a chocolate or candy, the higher its antioxidant content. Any added sugar, milk products, or cocoa butter simply dilute the cocoa solids and their phenolics. The dutching process also reduces the levels of desirable phenolics in cocoa powder, and the milk proteins in milk chocolate appear to bind to the same molecules and prevent us from absorbing them.\n\n#### Caffeine and Theobromine\nChocolate contains two related alkaloids, theobromine and caffeine, in the ratio of about 10 to 1. Theobromine is a weaker stimulant of the nervous system than caffeine is (p. 433); its main effect seems to be a diuretic one. However, it is quite toxic to dogs, who can suffer serious poisoning from chocolate candies. A 1-oz/30 gm piece of unsweetened chocolate contains around 30 mg of caffeine, around a third the dose in a cup of coffee; sweetened and milk chocolates contain substantially less. Cocoa powder has around 20 mg caffeine per tablespoon/10 g.\n\n#### Cravings for Chocolate\nMany people, especially women, experience cravings for chocolate that border on the symptoms of addiction, it has been thought that chocolate might contain psychoactive chemicals. Chocolate does turn out to contain both “cannabinoid” chemicals—chemicals similar to the active ingredient in marijuana—as well as other molecules that cause brain cells to accumulate cannabinoid chemicals. But these are present in extremely small amounts that probably have no practical significance. Similarly, chocolate contains phenylethylamine, a naturally occurring body chemical that has amphetamine-like effects—but then so do sausages and other fermented foods. In fact there is good experimental evidence that chocolate does not contain any drug-like substances capable of inducing a true addiction. Psychologists have shown that chocolate cravings can be satisfied by imitations that have no real chocolate in them, while these cravings are not satisfied by capsules of genuine cocoa powder or chocolate that are swallowed without tasting. It appears to be the sensory experience of eating chocolate, no more and no less, that is powerfully appealing."

The people who milk cows, goats, and other ruminant mammals have always been able to enjoy fresh milk, but as a practical matter most other people have had access to milk primarily in fermented forms. Generally, fermentation stabilizes milk, transforming it from a highly perishable substance into much more stable forms. Milk can ferment in many different ways, depending upon methods, cultures and coagulants, environmental conditions, and manipulations.\n\nAll but the freshest of cheeses are fermented, often for months or even years. The harder the cheese is, which is to say, the more liquid (in the form of whey) has been removed from it, the longer it has the potential to ferment and preserve, generally speaking. Fluid milk and cream are also widely fermented, usually for only a few hours or days, rendering them stable for short-term storage, as well as protected from food poisoning organisms by their acidification.\n\nThe fermented milk best known in the United States is yogurt, with kefir a distant second. Yogurt is a Turkish name for a style of fermented milk from Southeastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. Kefir is also a Turkish name, for a very different style of fermented milk, from the Caucasus Mountains. Yogurt is widely recognized and consumed across many cultures, highlighting its versatility and cultural significance."

It ferments completely in 6 to 8 hours.\n- **Characteristics**: Toddy has a short shelf-life and is typically sold immediately post-fermentation.\n\n#### Bamboo Sap (Ulanzi)\n- **Location**: Eastern and southern Africa\n- **Description**: Ulanzi is described as a clear, whitish drink with a sweet and alcoholic flavor.\n- **Fermentation Procedure**: Bamboo shoots should be young to ensure a high yield of sap. The growing tip is removed, and a container is fixed in place to collect the sap. Fermentation starts immediately and lasts between five and twelve hours depending on the strength of the final product desired.\n\n#### Green Cornstalks \n- **Analysis Process**: They can be pressed into juice, either to be fermented directly or boiled down into syrup.\n- **Historical Reference**: In the 1930s, ethnographers W.C. Bennett and R.M. Zing noted that the juice extraction involved removing leaves, pounding the stalks with oak sledges, and using a device called **mabihímala** (a net woven from yucca fiber with a stick) to wring the juice from stalks.\n\n#### Sugarcane Juice\n- **Fermentation Notes**: Sugarcane juice can ferment spontaneously, producing a light and bubbly beverage. There are traditions focusing on concentrating the sap by cooking it down. \n\n#### References\n- Documents mentioned include reports from the FAO and ethnographic studies from the 1930s, providing detailed preparation procedures and cultural contexts for these traditional beverages."

This molecule also plays an important part in the green flavour of Hass avocado.\"\n\n### Text Analysis: How sourdough rye bread gets its flavour\n\n- **Flavor Formation**: The flavour of sourdough rye bread is largely determined by the type and amount of fermentation occurring during its preparation. As the bread dough ferments, enzymes in the flour trigger the oxidation of lipid components to produce aroma molecules like oxidized fats and new volatile compounds, which may smell fatty, green, cucumber-like or even mushroom-like. The enzymes oxidize and turn various fats into butter or olive oil and create new aroma molecules. These interact during baking to create compounds such as typical malty flavors and toasted aromas as found in the crumb.\n\n- **Characteristics of Crumb**: In sourdough, the crumb is especially notable for toasted grain or cereal attributes and may also showcase malty bread crust flavors. The production includes caramel-scented furans and popcorn-like pyrazines, enhancing the overall aroma profile.\n\n- **Additional Notes**: Longer baking times allow more volatile aromatic compounds to develop, especially if the bread has been exposed to greater heat in the oven.\n\n### Sourdough Flavor Pairings Table\n\n#### Sourdough Flavor Pairings - Structured Markdown Table\n```markdown\n| Food                  | Smell      |Aroma   |Flavor   |Mouthfeel   |\n|-----------------------|------------|--------|---------|------------|\n| grapes                | ●          | ●      | ●●      |            |\n| cedar leaves          |            | ●      | ●       |            |\n| Chinese senzis        | ●          |        |         |            |\n| radish                | ●●●        | ●●●    | ●●●     | ●●●        |\n| red cabbage           | ●●         | ●●     | ●●      |            |\n| sourdough rye bread   | ●●●●       | ●●●●   | ●●●●    | ●●●●       |\n| Brie                  | ●          | ●●     | ●●●●    | ●●         |\n| dill                  |            | ●●     | ●       | ●          |\n| boiled mutton         | ●●●        | ●      | ●       |            |\n| papaya                | ●●         | ●      | ●●      | ●          |\n| cooked black salsify  | ●          | ●●     | ●●●     | ●          |\n```\n\nThis table describes the intensity of various sensory characteristics—smell, aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel—when paired with sourdough rye bread.

Advances include controlled year-round laying, improved lighting and temperature conditions, and rapid refrigerated transport.\n- **Drawbacks**: While quality has improved, some believe the flavor has degraded, possibly due to changes in the chickens' diets. Furthermore, industrial farming has increased the risk of salmonella contamination and raised ethical concerns regarding animal welfare.\n\n### Freer Range?\n- Discusses the growing preference for \"freer range\" conditions for chickens, driven by consumer discomfort with industrial practices and a willingness to pay more for eggs perceived as ethically produced. The terms \"free range\" and \"organically fed\" are becoming more popular, albeit sometimes the terminologies can be misleading.\n\n### How the Hen Makes an Egg\n- **Biological Process**: Describes the hen's reproductive process, which includes converting a significant portion of her body weight into eggs daily.\n- **Egg Formation**: Starts with a pinhead-sized white disc and evolves into the yolk where a living germ cell exists, containing the hen’s chromosomes.\n\n### Making the Yolk\n- Details the growth of germ cells in the hen's ovary, which develop into the yolk as the hen matures. The process from the initial formation of germ cells to a mature yolk described, involving several stages of cellular development.\n\nThis breakdown captures the key points discussed in the document about egg biology, production process, and the implications of industrial farming on both product quality and hen welfare."

They thrive in warm environments (82°F/28°C to 104°F/40°C), and the initial alcohol concentration of the liquid significantly affects the stability of the resulting vinegar, with around 5% alcohol concentration yielding approximately 4% acetic acid.\n\n---\n\n### Vinegar Production\n\nThe document describes three primary methods of vinegar production prevalent in the Western world:\n\n1. **The Orléans Process**\n   - Characterized as the oldest and slowest method, refined in Orléans during the Middle Ages.\n   - Involves adding diluted wine inoculated with bacteria from previous batches into barrels, which slowly ferment to transform the wine's alcohol into acetic acid.\n   - This traditional method is slow but develops rich and complex flavors in the vinegar as it only partially transforms the alcohol to acetic acid.\n\n2. **Streamlined Trickling and Submerged Cultures**\n   - This method contrasts with the static nature of the Orléans process by incorporating a 'trickling' system where wine is poured repeatedly over certain substrates to enhance fermentation.\n\n---\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of acidity in vinegar, which affects its stability and prevents spoilage. High alcohol levels are noted to inhibit bacterial activity, which is why dilution with water before fermentation can help maintain favorable conditions for vinegar production, despite potentially diluting the flavor.\n\nThis detailed examination of vinegar highlights its chemical basis, production variability, and the microbiological nuances inherent in achieving different flavors and qualities of vinegar."

Here’s a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### FLAVORINGS FROM PLANTS\n\n#### Mint Family\n- Members of the mint family thrive in dry, rocky Mediterranean scrublands and have adapted to cope well with exposed situations by developing chemical defenses, mainly in glands on their leaves.\n- These glands are not only defensive but also make the mint family suitable for breeding to develop a broad range of aromatic chemicals.\n\n#### Basil (Ocimum genus)\n- Basil is a significant and fascinating group of herbs from the mint family, originating from Africa and domesticated in India.\n- The genus **Ocimum** has around 165 species.\n- Historical context: Basil was first popular in Liguria and Provence, made famous by the preparation of pesto and pistou sauces. It gained popularity in North America and Europe primarily from the 1970s.\n- Notable species: **Ocimum basilicum** is known for its robust flavor and versatility, and there are several varieties including those flavored with lemon, lime, cinnamon, anise, and camphor.\n\n#### Other Types of Basil\n- **Thai basil (O. basilicum and O. tenuiflorum)** tends to have an anise-like and camphoraceous aroma.\n- **Holy basil (O. tenuiflorum)** is chiefly characterized by its eugenol content.\n\n#### Bergamot (Monarda didyma)\n- Known as bee balm and Oswego tea, it originates from North America.\n- It emits a lemony aroma, similar to that found in the flower linalyl acetate, an essential oil component also prominent in Earl Grey tea.\n- The term \"bergamot\" can be confusing as it is also used to describe a type of European water-mint.\n\n### Plants’ Defense Mechanisms\n- Description includes how mint family plants possess microscopic oil glands on their leaves, acting both as a defense mechanism against predators and as a source of the distinctive aromatic qualities favored in culinary uses.\n\nThis summary encapsulates key details about herbal plants from the mint family, focusing on their aromatic properties, utility in cooking, and botanical characteristics."

    "contenu": "The provided document discusses aspects related to \"Cereal doughs and batters,\" focusing on bread staling, its reversal, and storage methods. Below, the text is structured into key sections as extracted from the document:\n\n### Starch Retrogradation and Its Effects\n- **Initial Firming of Bread Loaf:** Starch retrogradation is responsible for the initial firming of a freshly baked bread loaf, which enhances the bread's ability to be sliced. This process occurs rapidly, typically within a day of baking.\n- **Starch Molecules Behavior:** The majority of starch molecules are amylopectins which retrograde slowly over several days, contributing to further firming of bread texture.\n\n### Reversing Staling\n- **Reheating:** Staling is partly reversible by reheating bread, which redistributes water molecules around starch granules, thereby softening the bread.\n\n### Bread Storage Recommendations\n- **Avoid Refrigeration:** Staling accelerates at temperatures just above freezing. It's advised to store bread at room temperature and consume within a few days or freeze it for longer preservation.\n- **Moisture Management:** To keep the bread crust crispy, storing bread in a breadbox or wrapping it lightly with paper is recommended.\n\n### Bread Spoilage\n- **Low Water Content:** Bread spoils slower than many other foods due to its relatively low moisture content. Storing bread at room temperature in a plastic bag is suggested to prevent drying out before microbial spoilage can occur.\n\n### The Value of Stale Bread\n- **Culinary Uses:** Stale bread is not only useful but preferred in some culinary preparations such as bread salads, bread puddings, and as a binding agent in various dishes. Stale bread retains a sponge-like structure which is advantageous for these applications.\n- **Structural Role:** The structural integrity of stale bread is attributed primarily to the starch component which, after retrogradation, helps to maintain the network structure of the bread, making it suitable for certain recipes.\n\nThis section concludes citing an unspecified source on page 458 of the main reference, pertaining to the structural uses of starch in stale bread."

It’s estimated to be 12,000 times more than our Paleolithic ancestors.\n- **Example Foods:** Table salt, soy sauce, bacon, and Nacho Cheese Doritos are mentioned as salt-rich foods that enhance other tastes.\n\n### Sweet\n- **Significance:** Humans have a natural inclination towards sweet tastes due to their nutritional benefits in fruits, which were easy for ancient humans to gather.\n- **Behavioral Impact:** Sweetness tends to be the first taste we notice and can dominate or enhance the overall flavor experience.\n- **Example Concepts:** The document mentions incorporating other types of aromatic spices like clover or tang tangy lemon to round out the sweet flavor profile. The compound nature of sweetness leads to considering fruitiness as a part of the sweet category instead of a separate taste.\n\n### Picante\n- **Nature of Taste:** Picante involves the sensation of heat on the tongue, related to nerve responses rather than traditional taste buds.\n- **Cultural Reference:** In different cuisines, like Peruvian or Cajun, spicy elements are crucial. Examples include dishes from Lima, Peru, and Lafayette, Louisiana, which rely on ingredients like cayenne pepper to enhance flavors.\n- **Example Foods:** Cajun court bouillon is specifically mentioned, noting how removing or altering ingredients like cayenne can drastically change the experience from rich and flavorful to bland.\n\nThe text utilizes these taste profiles to explain their physiological, psychological, and culinary importance, supported by anthropological data and current culinary preferences."
