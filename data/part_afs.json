However, market forces may in time lead to a reversal of this trend.\n\n**While some wine businesses are profitable, there are others that struggle due to lack of demand.** Some steep vineyard sites in Mosel have been abandoned because the costs of production could only be recovered by pricing the wines at a level consumers were not prepared to pay."

Here is a transcribed version of its content:\n\n---\n\nWhen the wine has reached about 7 to 9 percent alcohol, and about 3 to 5 percent of the natural grape sugar (residual sugar) remains, it is chilled down to stabilize it, centrifuged to remove all remaining yeasts, and bottled. At that point the sparkler is immediately shipped, so that it can be consumed at its freshest and liveliest. Asti producers do not generally put vintage dates on bottles, since the wines for sale should always (you hope) be from the immediate past harvest.\n\nEach year, 68 million bottles of Asti are made by a handful of giant companies, including Cinzano, Contratto, Gancia, Fontanafredda, and Martini & Rossi. In fact, more than five times as much Asti is made yearly than Barolo.\n\n--- \n\nThe document provides an overview of how Asti wine is made, the specifics of its bottling and shipping, and a comparison of its production volume with another wine, Barolo. It also mentions the major producers of Asti wine."

    "contenu": "# A PASSION FOR PAPRIKA\n\nIt's hard to imagine that three centuries ago, one of the (now) defining ingredients of the Hungarian kitchen—paprika—was not yet known in Hungary. But paprika, along with several other Hungarian culinary essentials—tomatoes, sour cherries, coffee, and phyllo (which the Hungarians immortalized by reinventing as strudel)—were all introduced by the Turks during their numerous occupations. Be that as it may, in Hungary, paprika found its truest admirers and its raison d'être. Fiery and passionate themselves, Hungarians like their dishes to have drama. Even something as simple as paprika chicken (_paprikás csirke_) is a kind of lusty and luscious duel between the tangy richness of sour cream on the one hand and the tantalizing bite of paprika on the other. Of course, in Hungary, paprika is not a single thing. The Hungarians classify it into eight types, starting with the mildest and sweetest, Különleges, which is bright red in color, and proceeding to Erős, a very spicy version that is light brown in color. The region of Szeged is generally considered to produce the best paprika in Hungary. Interestingly, the peppers used to make paprika have the highest vitamin C content of any vegetable. Indeed, paprika was used in numerous experiments by Hungarian physiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1937 for his discovery of vitamin C.\n\n---\n\nBotrytized grapes destined to become Hungary's elixir, Tokaji Aszú, one of the world's most sensational wines. Hungary was the first country in the world to make wine from grapes affected by noble rot. Each perfectly shriveled berry will be picked out of the cluster by hand.\n\nProducers differ slightly in how they make Tokaji Aszú, but generally speaking the process goes like this. First, throughout the fall, the shriveled aszú grapes are picked by hand, berry by berry—not cluster by cluster—from botrytis-affected bunches. These aszú grapes are then brought to the winery, where they are lightly crushed into a paste. Meanwhile, the rest of the crop (all the grapes and bunches not affected by botrytis) is picked separately and made into a base wine. The aszú paste is added in various proportions to the base wine of the same year. (In the past, aszú was sometimes added to a base wine held back from the previous year; this practice is now rare.)\n\nThe proportions of aszú added are measured in _puttonyos_. A _puttony_ is a basket in which the aszú grapes were traditionally gathered. It holds 44 to 55 pounds (20 to 25 kilograms) of grapes, equal to about 5.2 gallons (20 liters) of aszú paste. The ratio of wine held back from the previous year, in this practice, is now rare."

Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### Human Olfactory Receptors\n- **Genetic Aspect**: Humans have 20,000 genes, and incredibly, 1 in every 20 of these is an odor receptor gene. This suggests a high biological significance in our ability to discern different smells.\n\n### Cognitive Processing of Smells\n- **Beyond Receptors**: The size of the nasal cavity and the cognitive capabilities of the larger human brain enhance our ability to distinguish between different scents.\n- **Higher Cognitive Functioning**: Humans integrate prior experiences with smells, combining this with language and associative thinking to recognize and catalog both familiar and unfamiliar scents.\n\n### Superior Smell Perception\n- **Comparison with Other Species**: Humans might not have the most receptor neurons compared to some mammals, but the sharper cognitive processing capabilities allow humans to reach an advanced level of smell discernment.\n- **Capability to Improve**: With training, humans can become expert at identifying scents, highlighting the potential of human smell perception.\n\n### Genetic Variation in Olfactory Perception\n- **Individual Differences**: About 30% of olfactory receptors vary from one person to another due to genetic differences, which contributes to the unique smell detection capabilities of each individual.\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Human receptors analyze complex scent patterns (e.g., breaking down cinnamon into citrus lemon, spicy cinnamon, clove, and camphor), which the brain then identifies distinctly.\n\n### Advanced Olfactory Research\n- **Olfactory Fingerprint**: The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel has developed a test that can differentiate individuals based on their response to smells, identifying 34 separate odors via 54 aromatic descriptors. This results in a unique \"olfactory fingerprint\" for each person.\n\nThis document primarily educates on the biological, genetic, and cognitive essentials that underpin our sense of smell, explaining how each component contributes to the distinctive human olfactory experience."

There are primarily three types of cocktail shakers available:\n\n1. **Three-piece Shakers (Cobbler Shakers)**\n   - **Composition**: Consists of a mixing cup, a top with an integrated strainer, and a cap.\n   - **Usage**: You build the drink in the cup, add ice, seal with the top, shake, and then strain it into your glass.\n   - **Varieties**: Available in various sizes, from single-drink shakers to larger multi-party sizes.\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Aesthetically pleasing and more \"complete\" single unit.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Prone to jamming after shaking.\n     - Does not strain as quickly or effectively, potentially leaving drinks with unwanted ice fragments.\n     - Some models, especially smaller ones, are harder to handle and can leak.\n\n2. **Two-piece Shakers (Boston Shakers)**\n   - **Composition**: Consists of two cups, one metal and the other often glass, that fit together.\n   - **Usage**: Widely used by professional bartenders in the U.S., both at home and in bars.\n   - **Pros**:\n     - More popular and generally considered to provide a better seal.\n     - Allows for consistent and reliable usage.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Initially believed to be challenging to seal properly, though regular use disproves this as they tend to seal and shake reliably.\n\n3. **Parisian Shaker**\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Visually appealing.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - Less common and not detailed in robustness or practicality in the text.\n\n#### Additional Insights\n- **Cultural Preferences**:\n  - Some Japanese bartenders believe a cobbler shaker can produce different ice crystals which may improve the drink’s texture. However, this is viewed skeptically and remains untested.\n- **Material Considerations**:\n  - Metal shakers are standard among professionals, though there are instances where plastic shakers are used due to their softness potentially creating different ice textures.\n- **Reliability Issues**:\n  - Poorly made three-piece shakers are notorious for jamming issues and leaks.\n\n#### Personal Preference\n- The author personally favors the use of two-piece Boston shakers, finding them reliable for daily use and effective in creating well-mixed drinks. They also highlight a metal-on-glass setup where a standard U.S. pint glass fits inside a 28-ounce metal tin, enhancing the seal and overall usability."

Whether it makes sense for you to buy one is another question entirely.\n\nIt’s telling that centuries ago, when stemware was first commercially available, it was viewed as a status symbol. Crystal is beautiful but fragile, and desperately impractical as well. Owning one set was a sign of wealth; owning many conveyed serious prestige. Not much has changed.

    "contenu": "# TUSCANY\n\n## Introduction\n*Toscana* to the Italians, Tuscany is the quintessential Italian wine region. Here, where the Renaissance was born and where the church has reigned with near omnipotent power, wine has strong ties to both art and religion. Yet at the same time, wine has always been the most humble of Tuscan comforts—on the table at every meal (breakfast excepted); sometimes, with a piece of bread, a meal in itself.\n\n## Wine and Geography\nTuscany is also the birthplace of four of Italy’s most important red wines: Chianti, Chianti Classico, brunello di Montalcino, and vino nobile di Montepulciano. Though all are made from the variety sangiovese, the wines taste quite different. One reason is that Tuscany is a plethora of distinct mesoclimates. These are created by an endless succession of twisting, turning, undulating hills and low mountains. Another reason is that sangiovese, a finicky and demanding grape, has begotten hundreds of clones or genetic variations of itself. Over time, these variations have adapted to their local environments and taken on distinct flavor characteristics. It’s fascinating to know that while sangiovese is today inextricably linked to Tuscany, the variety appears to have originated in southern Italy. Surprising DNA research in 2004 revealed one of sangiovese’s parents to be Calabrese di Montenuovo (from Calabria), and the other parent to be ciliegiolo (Italian for “small cherry”), now cultivated all over Italy.\n\n## Quote on Sangiovese\n“Sangiovese, to be a great wine, needs a good connection with God.”\n— LAMBERTO FRESCOBALDI, Marc hesi de’Frescobaldi\n\n## The Quick Sip on Tuscany\n- **TUSCANY IS THE HOME** of four of Italy's most important, well-known red wines: Chianti, Chianti Classico, brunello di Montalcino, and vino nobile di Montepulciano.\n- **THE LEADING RED GRAPE**, used in every major traditional wine, is sangiovese, considered one of the greatest red grapes of Italy.\n- **A WINE REVOLUTION** in the 1970s and 1980s led to wines of an immensely higher quality, as well as the creation of the so-called Super Tuscans, a group of avant-garde, expensive wines made in an untraditional manner.\n\n## Cultural Shift in Wine Perception\nFor English-speaking wine drinkers and food lovers in the 1960s, Tuscany seemed to symbolize a kind of cultural chic. Chianti wines, in particular, were romantic, earthy, “European,” and fit the bohemian esthetic (and budget). But the old Chianti of red checkered tablecloths and amorous evenings was, for the most part, not very good wine. By the 1970s the market for Chianti—and the wine’s international reputation—had reached an all-time low. As the full impact of this realization began to sink in, Tuscans were shocked into action. With the help of new wine laws (see the Appendix on Wine Laws, page 924), the Tuscan wine industry bounced back with what is considered one of the most dramatic revolutions in the world of modern wine. The result was vastly superior, exciting wines, including a slew of internationally acclaimed, expensive Super Tuscans."

    "contenu": "The document page provided is about \"Sparkling Wine Production\" and covers various aspects of the production process, specifically focusing on riddling and bottle ageing, along with a specific method called the Transfer Method. Here’s the breakdown of the content on the page:\n\n### Sparkling Wine Production\nPage number: 175\n\n#### Riddling\n1. **Riddling by hand**: This traditional method can take up to eight weeks to move the bottle from a horizontal to a vertical position. The frame holding the bottles is called a pupitre.\n2. **Riddling using gyropalettes**: This modern approach allows riddling to be completed in a matter of days.\n3. **Bottles of Cava after riddling**: Post-riddling, the yeast sediment is clearly visible in the bottles.\n\nThe page includes three images related to the text:\n- Image 1 shows a man handling the riddling process by hand using a pupitre.\n- Image 2 displays the gyropalettes used in the modern riddling method.\n- Image 3 depicts bottles of Cava illustrating the yeast sediment after the riddling process.\n\n#### Bottle ageing\n- Explains that after corking, sparkling wine may be aged further for several months to integrate with the liqueur d'expédition. Most are ready to drink upon release, but some premium wines benefit from further ageing.\n- It details the difficulty in knowing the precise age of a sparkling wine since it's hard to determine if the wine inside the bottle is youthful or mature. Some producers include disgorgement dates on their labels to clarify the wine's age.\n\n#### Transfer Method\n- Described as an adaptation of traditional methods, it avoids the complex processes of riddling and disgorgement up to the point of riddling. In the transfer method, entire contents of bottles are simply disgorged into a sealed tank under pressure.\n- The wine, after removing yeast residues using filtration and adding liqueur d'expédition, is re-bottled into a fresh bottle. This method provides a cost-effective way of producing high-quality sparkling wines.\n\nThis structured content condenses the information found on the page regarding specific sparkling wine production techniques."

Below is a structured outline of the document:\n\n1. **Historical Context of Spanish Rule**:\n   - The Moors (Muslims and Berbers from Northwest Africa) conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula, their rule spanning over seven centuries.\n   - The defeat of the Moors in 1492 at the Battle of Granada coincided with Christopher Columbus's voyages, marking the onset of Christian rule in Spain under a united monarchy.\n\n2. **Traditional Wine-making Practices**:\n   - Despite modern technologies, many Spanish vintners still adhere to traditional methods believed to be fading, like manual harvesting and respecting ancestral wine-making wisdom.\n   - The maintenance of traditional flavors that result from these age-old practices is highly valued.\n\n3. **Preservation of Indigenous Grape Varieties**:\n   - Spanish wine-makers show a strong preference for indigenous grape varieties such as mencía, godello, hondarrabi zuri, cariñena, verdejo, despite the global trend of favoring varieties like cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay.\n   - There's a strong commitment among Spanish vintners to preserve their historical varieties.\n\n4. **Aging Process in Wine Production**:\n   - Traditional Spanish wines were aged in barrels longer than any other wines in the world, sometimes up to twenty-five years.\n   - Modern tastes have shifted, reducing the aging period, yet a Rioja gran reserva aged for five years is still highly regarded for its quality.\n\n5. **Cultural Misconceptions**:\n   - There’s a common misconception that Spain’s hot climate only produces strong, coarse wines.\n   - In reality, Spanish wine regions are known for producing wines with significant complexity and subtlety.\n\nThe document also includes an image of large wine cellars or \"bodegas\" in Jerez, noted for housing thousands of barrels where Sherry matures, illustrating the large-scale and historical depth of wine storage and aging in Spain."

It is structured into sections that discuss different tools and their usage in a bar setting.\n\n### Equipment Details\n\n**Droppers:**\n- **Description:** Use glass bottles with screw-on eyedroppers for dosing liquids in cocktails.\n- **Usage:** Ideal for small amounts of saltwater, bitters, etc.\n- **Tip:** Choose bottles with differing dasher tops sizes for varying dash amounts.\n- **Personal Practice:** Reuse old Tabasco and Angostura bottles by washing off labels and refilling.\n\n**Ice Storage:**\n- **Description:** Ice should be stored in large, insulated containers with integral drains.\n- **Tools:** Metal scoops or shaking tins are used to pick up the ice.\n- **Home Setup:** A drain tap, metal bucket, and a plastic rack are recommended to keep the ice from melting into water.\n- **Aesthetic Note:** Ice containment should be visually appealing.\n\n**Capper:**\n- **Purpose:** Essential for bottling drinks.\n- **Recommendation:** Acquire a handheld bottle capper.\n- **Availability:** Can be found cheaply at any home-brew shop.\n\n### Additional Equipment for Measuring, Testing, and Making Ingredients\n\n**Weight-Measuring Equipment:**\n- **Rationale:** Despite drinks mostly being measured by volume, certain ingredients like sugars for syrup and hydrocolloids should be weighed.\n- **Preferred Units:** Weighing should be done in grams as water can be directly converted from grams (weight) to milliliters (volume) at standard temperature (1 gram = 1 milliliter).\n- **Suggested Scales:** \n  - One scale reading in one-gram increments.\n  - Another scale for more precise measurements in tenth-of-a-gram increments.\n- **Clarification:** For extremely precise measurements, one should specify a \"drug scale,\" as it is understood to measure up to 1/10 gram accuracy.\n\nThis structured content highlights the importance of both common and specialized equipment in cocktail making, focusing on efficiency, precision, and aesthetics."

Lamb and white asparagus, however, are just the beginning.\n\n### Description of Rioja Cuisine\nRioja is a region of basic foodstuffs, straightforward cooking techniques, and hearty dishes. The success of any given dish is based solely on the integrity and freshness of the ingredients. Herbs and spices are rarely used. The simple homeyness of the food is beautifully in tune with the elegant, sweetly ripe flavors and silky textures of Rioja wines.\n\nThe fertile Ebro River valley is planted with a panoply of vegetables and fruits; the surrounding hills and mountains are home to goats, lambs, rabbits, quail, and large wild game. Rioja’s goat cheeses are renowned. The *cabrito* (baby goat) roasted in a brick oven is to die for. And, as is true in many inland regions of Spain, the local *embutido* (charcuterie) is irresistible.\n\n### Classic Dishes of Rioja\n\n- **Chuletas al sarmiento**: Lamb chops grilled over an open fire of vine shoots.\n- **Menestra de verduras**: A vegetable casserole that, depending on the season, includes artichokes, asparagus, Swiss chard, peas, carrots, leeks, or green beans tossed together with diced, cured ham and sautéed in olive oil.\n- **Patatas a la riojana**: Potatoes cooked in meat stock with spicy chorizo sausage.\n- **Pochas a la riojana**: A stew of young white beans, chorizo, peppers, and tomatoes, sometimes with roasted quail added.\n- **Pimientos rellenos**: Small, sweet local red peppers stuffed with minced meat or shrimp or puréed vegetables, then dipped in batter, fried, and cooked in a wine and tomato sauce. Sometimes cod, hake, or pig’s feet are added to the stuffing.\n\n### When You Visit Rioja:\n\n#### Attractions and Activities\n\n- **Rioja Bodegas**: Visit dark, damp cellars of old Rioja where bodegas like R. López de Heredia and Federico Paternina showcase bottles of decades-old wine alongside mold and cobwebs, displaying the rich history of winemaking in the region.\n- **Architecture**: Marqués de Riscal is recommended for architecture lovers, designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry, mimicking features similar to his work on the Guggenheim Museum.\n- **Bodega Dinastia Vivanco**: Explore an impressive museum offering permanent exhibits on the history, culture, and technology of winemaking, with interactive and hands-on activities available."

    "contenu": "# GRAPPA\n\nYou can always tell when Italians don't want the night to end. Out comes the grappa. This, in turn, causes everyone to recount their most infamous grappa-drinking stories—which leads to the pouring of more grappa, which leads to more stories. Although today grappa is made and drunk all over Italy, historically it was a specialty of the northern part of the country, where a small shot in the morning coffee helped one get going on a freezing day.\n\nGrappa is the clear brandy that results when grape pomace (the pulpy mash of stems, seeds, and skins left over from winemaking) is refermented and distilled. Depending on the quality of the raw material and the method of distillation, the final product can taste as though a grenade has just ignited in your throat, or it can taste smooth, winey, and powerful. Ue, a softer, lighter type of grappa invented and made famous by the firm Nonino, is a distillate of actual grapes rather than pomace. And grappa di monovitigno is a grappa from a single grape variety, such as riesling, moscato, gewürztraminer, or picolit. These grappas are considered superior because the result carries a faint suggestion of the aroma and flavor of the original grapes. Expensive and rare, such grappas incite cult worship. In fact, grappa fans are called tifosi di grappa, a phrase that implies almost feverish allegiance (the word tifosi also refers to people suffering from typhoid).\n\nThe bottles are part of the attraction. Since the late 1980s, the dazzling, avant-garde designs of grappa bottles have been nothing less than astounding. No northern Italian enoteca is without an astonishing display of these elegant bottles, each holding a grappa that looks far more innocent than it tastes.\n\n_When grappa seems like a good idea, it usually means I should have already gone home._\n\nItaly’s wine revolution was provoked by a set of regulations defining the areas where specific wines can be made. These laws—Denominazione di Origine Controllata, Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita, and Indicazione Geografica Tipica—are known by their acronyms DOC, DOCG, and IGT. More than 330 wine zones have been designated as DOCs and 73 as DOCGs, yet the wines from these zones, widely regarded as many of the best wines in the country, represent only a small percentage of all the Italian wines produced. Some 118 wine areas have been named IGTs, a more humble designation. (These same laws are the ones that ensure that cheeses such as Parmigiano are protected.)"

    "contenu": "The document provides a recipe for a cold coffee drink called \"Coffee Zacapa,\" which incorporates Ron Zacapa 23 Solera rum. Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n### Ingredients for Coffee Zacapa\n- Ron Zacapa 23 Solera rum: 750 ml, divided into a 500 ml portion and a 250 ml portion\n- Filtered water: 100 ml\n- Whole fresh coffee beans, roasted on the dark side: 100 grams\n- Whole milk: 185 ml\n- Citric acid or lemon juice (optional, if needed)\n\n### Procedure\n1. **Grind Preparation:**\n   - Grind the coffee beans in a spice grinder until it is slightly finer than drip grind.\n\n2. **Initial Infusion:**\n   - Combine 500 ml rum and the ground coffee in a half-liter iSi whipper.\n   - Charge the whipper with one charger, shake, and then add a second charger.\n   - Shake for another 30 seconds.\n   - Total infusion time should be around 1 minute and 15 seconds.\n\n3. **Filtering:**\n   - Let the mixture rest briefly after shaking to prevent overinfusion.\n   - Pour through a fine-mesh filter into a coffee filter.\n   - If the mixture clogs the filter, it indicates the grind was too fine.\n\n4. **Sparge:**\n   - Stir the drained grounds in the coffee filter, then add the 100 ml water over the grounds and let it drip through (this is called sparging).\n   - This process helps in replacing some rum absorbed by the coffee grounds during the initial infusion.\n\n5. **Final Composition:**\n   - The final liquid mixture should have an approximate ratio of 50% water and 50% rum after taking account for the loss to the grounds.\n\n6. **Adjusting Taste:**\n   - Taste the infusion and if strong, this is desirable.\n   - If the infusion is too strong and difficult to moderate, consider adding the additional 250 ml of rum. \n\n**Notes:**\n- The additional 250 ml of rum can be added to tone down the infusion without significantly decreasing the alcohol content, ensuring it remains palatable but potent.\n\n--- \n\nThis recipe manipulation allows for a rich infusion, tightly controlling the grind size, infusion time, and the balance between the coffee and alcohol components."

    "contenu": "This document, titled \"Key Aromas,\" discusses the use of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify, separate, and quantify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in products or ingredients. The document explains how the methodology works—by feeding the ingredient into the gas chromatograph, wherein compounds are separated based on their molecular weights, travel through the spectrometer, and produce a unique retention time on a graph which represents the quantity of the molecule present.\n\nThe text specifically highlights the aroma profile analysis of a strawberry, noting that not every peak in the gas chromatogram will contribute to the fruit's taste, as people can only perceive significant amounts of certain groups of aromatic molecules. Examples of strawberry aroma molecules mentioned include:\n- Coconut-scented lactones\n- Fruity esters\n- Aldehydes (with a greenish scent)\n- Carmellic furanones\n- Cheesy acids\n\nThese molecules are depicted on a graph showing peaks, each labeled with the name of the chemical compound they represent. Important peaks include molecules like:\n- ethyl 2-methylbutanoate\n- methyl butanoate\n- ethyl butanoate\n- dihydro-β-ionol\n- β-ionone\n\nThis chromatogram graph measures the intensity units (arb.counts) against retention time (minutes), effectively mapping out the aroma molecules present in a strawberry as demonstrated by five key peaks within a scale of 15 minutes."
