It's native to the West Indies, but now found throughout tropical Asia. Its small berry-like fruits are intensely bitter, and are used in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia to contribute just that quality to sauces and salads.\n\n**Rau Ram**\n- **Description:** The Vietnamese name for a sprawling herb in the buckwheat family known in English as fragrant knotweed, and now as Vietnamese cilantro *Polygonum odoratum*. It's a native of Southeast Asia whose leaves mix the aromas of coriander and lemon with a slightly peppery taste. It’s often paired with mint and eaten fresh with many foods.\n\n**Rice-Paddy Herb**\n- **Description:** An aquatic plant in the snapdragon family, *Limnophila chinensis sess*. Aromatic, a native of Asia and the Pacific islands, whose small leaves are used in Southeast Asian fish dishes, soups, and curries, especially in Vietnam. It has a lemony but complex aroma produced by small quantities of a citrusy terpene and the main ingredient of perilla (perillaldehyde).\n\n**Rose Flowers**\n- **Description:** Mainly from the Eurasian hybrid *Rosa × damascena*, have been used for millennia from the Middle East through Asia, usually dried or in the form of an extract (rose water). Their aroma comes mainly from the terpene geraniol. Roses are most often used in sweets but are also found in the savory Moroccan spice mixture ras el hanout, and in North African sausages.\n\n**Screwpine or Pandan**\n- **Description:** *Pandanus* species, are aromatic, strap-like leaf of shrubs related to the lily family that are native to Indonesia (used in India and Southeast Asia to flavor rice dishes and sweets, and to wrap meats and fish). Their primary volatile compound is the same one that gives basmati and jasmine rices their distinctive nutty aroma (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline), which is also prominent in the aroma of popcorn and of crabmeat. The screwpine flower is also aromatic and the source of a more perfume-like extract called kewra, which flavors many Indian milk sweets.\n\n**Sorrel**\n- **Description:** The startlingly sour leaf of several European relatives of rhubarb and buckwheat that are rich in oxalic acid: *Rumex acetosa, scutatus,* and *acetosella*. Cooks use them mainly as a source of acidity, and they also provide a more generic green aroma. Sorrel readily disintegrates with a little cooking into a sauce-like puree that complements fish, but whose chlorophyll turns drab olive from the acidity. The color can be brightened by pureeing some raw sorrel and adding that to the sauce just before serving.\n\n**Tarragon**\n- **Description:** The small, narrow leaf of a native of western and northern Asia, *Artemisia dracunculus*, a member of the lettuce family. The robust wild tarragon, often sold in plant nurseries as Russian tarragon, has a harsh and uninteresting flavor, while the relatively fragile cultivated form, “French” tarragon, has a distinctive aroma thanks to the presence of a phenolic compound called estragole (from the French name for the plant, *estragon*) in oil cavities alongside the leaf veins. Estragole is a close chemical relative of the anise aromatic anethole and does have an anise-like character. Tarragon is a component of the French mix *fines herbes*, is the primary flavoring in béarnaise sauce, and is often used to flavor vinegars.\n\n**Mexican tarragon**\n- **Description:** *Tagetes lucida*, a marigold-like New World native, whose leaves do indeed contain a mixture of anise-like anethole and tarragon’s estragole."

Here's the text summary:\n\n---\n**CRIANZA, RESERVA, AND GRAN RESERVA**\n\nAs in Rioja, Ribera del Duero wines can be classified according to the quality of the grapes and how long the wines are aged. It is noted that \"can be\" is used because some modern producers may opt not to use these designations. For those that do, wines are categorized into three types:\n- **crianza**\n- **reserva**\n- **gran reserva**\n\nAdditionally, it mentions that in Ribera del Duero, one may also find simpler, grapey wines known as **tintos joven** (young reds), though these are rarely exported."

This type of microscopy image likely used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques to capture the intricate textures and structures of the fungal hyphae, which are the thread-like filaments that make up the mycelium of a fungus. These hyphae are essential to the fungus as they facilitate the absorption of nutrients from the cheese. The *Penicillium* species are particularly notable for their role in cheese ripening and flavor development."

    "contenu": "The document is a page from a book or reference material discussing the topic \"SEEDS\" with a specific focus on almonds and Brazil nuts.\n\n---\n\n### Why Almonds Don't Taste Like Almond Flavoring\n\nStandard domesticated almonds taste delicately nutty, unlike the strong and distinctive flavoring known as \"almond extract.\" The strong almond flavor found in wild or bitter almonds is due to their high levels of a toxic substance. When eaten, these almonds can be deadly, as they contain a defensive system generating benzaldehyde, a volatile molecule contributing to the natural almond flavor but also producing cyanide as a by-product. Domestic \"sweet\" almond varieties, on the other hand, lack the bitterness and certain aromatic qualities.\n\nBitter almonds are unavailable in the U.S., but in Europe, they are used in small amounts to flavor food made from sweet almonds, like amaretti cookies and amaretto.\n\n### Almond Characteristics\n\nThe almond is closely related to the peach, plum, and cherry, featuring a stony shell. \n\n### Almond Extracts and Imitations\n\nThe common form of bitter-almond flavor in products is a bottled extract containing aromatic benzaldehyde but sans the cyanide found in raw almonds themselves. There are varying types of almond extract:\n- **Pure**: Derived from bitter almonds.\n- **Natural**: Contains benzaldehyde from cassia bark.\n- **Imitation**: Contains benzaldehyde synthesized from chemicals.\n\n### Brazil Nuts\n\nBrazil nuts are significantly larger than almonds and come from the Bertholletia excelsa tree in the Amazon region. They develop in large pods containing several seeds and only break off from trees naturally due to their own weight. These nuts are high in oil content and can be quite large, nearly the calorific equivalent of two large eggs. Brazil nuts are identified for their unique containment properties.\n\nThis detailed overview encapsulates the unique qualities and flavors of almonds and Brazil nuts, providing insights into their uses, origins, and potentially poisonous nature."

    "contenu": "### The Extraordinary Flavors of Fermentation\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to the lactic acid flavor of fermentation. Sour pickles (kosher dills) were what I most loved and sought out as a child, but I never turned down sauerkraut either. To this day, not just the smell but the mere thought of this lactic acid flavor triggers my salivary glands. As a rule, fermentation creates strong, compelling flavors.\n\nNor is lactic acid the only flavor of fermentation. Take a walk through any gourmet food palace and what you will see and smell are primarily fermented foods. I visualize myself walking into Zabar’s, a New York City gourmet food wonderland I have visited since early childhood. The first food I see is olives, barrels of olives cured in different ways. (Raw olives are toxic and horribly bitter.) _Curing_ is a broad term encompassing many different techniques of aging (even beyond food), but frequently involves fermentation. Olives are often cured by fermentation in a simple brine. Turning my back on the olives, I feast my eyes on a dazzling array of cheeses. Cheeses are not all fermented, but all the ones with strong flavors and aromas are, as well as hard cheeses and soft ones with runny textures. The enormous variety we find among cheeses is largely a result of the different bacteria and fungi developing in them, along with the conditions in which they age. To accompany the cheeses, there is a bakery, with breads in many different shapes, sizes, and flavors. Fermentation is what saves bread from being a dense brick, endowing it with texture, crumb, and lightness, as well as flavor. At the meat counter, fermented products add even more to the richness of offerings."

It mentions the degradation of lighter oil components, leaving tougher, more recalcitrant compounds. It also discusses the role of cold temperatures and low oxygen levels in the deep sea, which slow down the metabolism of bacteria tasked with breaking down oil.\n   - Chemical dispersants and fertilizers are mentioned as aids to increase bacterial access to oil and to enhance microbial growth.\n\n2. **Genetic Engineering:**\n   - Attempts have been made to genetically engineer bacteria that can more efficiently digest hydrocarbons. Ronald Atlas, a microbiologist who evaluated cleanup strategies following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, notes the limitations, such as genetically engineered bacteria competing with native species and failing to adapt.\n\n3. **Mycoremediation:**\n   - Paul Stamets, a mycologist, is highlighted for his work in mycoremediation—using fungi to clean contaminated soils. Fungi, described as \"molecular disassemblers,\" break down complex toxins into simpler, less harmful chemicals.\n   - Stamets promotes using fungal mycelia in contaminated soils or mixed with wood chips in soil, starting a broader ecological recovery through the synergy between multiple kingdoms (fungus, plant, bacterium, animal).\n\n4. **Use of Acclimated Spawn:**\n   - Stamets recommends using mycelia acclimated to wild bacteria. This spawn, used alongside bacteria that produce toxin-digesting enzymes, is more effective in handling toxic sites than non-acclimated mycelia.\n\n### Methodologies Described:\n- **Chemical Enhancements:** Using dispersants and fertilizers to facilitate microbial digestion.\n- **Genetic Engineering:** Developing bacteria capable of more effective biodegradation.\n- **Mycoremediation:** Utilizing fungi's natural capabilities to break down toxins in contaminated environments.\n  \n### Prospects for Ecological Recovery:\n- Use of bioremediation introduces non-native elements but can foster complex ecological partnerships leading to recovery. Deploying fungi and acclimated microbial communities represents a potentially transformative approach to remediation, emphasizing synergy among various biological entities."

    "contenu": "### Arnie's Corner\n\n**Body** may be the most important factor in choosing wine. Wines that are more light-bodied feel more refreshing, so we crave them in warm weather. The reverse is true for more full-bodied styles, whose heart-warming qualities we hanker for in colder months. We’re most likely to want to start off with light wines as aperitifs to pique the appetite, opting to serve the heaviest wines with the main dish. Most important, our perception of body as wine’s texture correlates closely with how we perceive texture in food. Alcohol feels rich in the mouth in almost exactly the same way as fat does. The more oils or fats in a particular dish, the better it will harmonize with full-bodied, high-alcohol wines.\n\nPage: 64\nSource: Wine Secrets"

    "contenu": "The document is a discussion on cocktail preparation techniques, focusing on \"Stirring vs. Shaking\".\n\n---\n\n### Stirring vs. Shaking\n\n**General Rule of Thumb**: If a cocktail contains any opaque or cloudy ingredients, such as fruit juices, egg, or cream, it should be shaken vigorously. Conversely, if a cocktail consists entirely of transparent ingredients like spirits, vermouth, sweeteners, bitters, and so on, it should be stirred.\n\n**Reason**: The distinction primarily comes down to texture. Shaking not only mixes but aerates the drink, adding texture through air bubbles and emulsification, which livens up the ingredients. Stirring, on the other hand, simply chills and dilutes the drink without adding air, resulting in a cocktail with a smooth, silky texture that is cold and has a slightly effervescent first sip.\n\n**Philosophy and Approach**:\n- **Stirring**: It's about chilling and diluting a drink in a way that doesn't agitate the drink too much. The finished drink should feel like extremely cold silk, smooth over the tongue and down the throat.\n- **Shaking**: Meant to wake up the drink with a frothy texture, a refreshing aroma, and a light effervescence.\n\n### Stirring Cocktails\n\n**Training Analogy**: The process of learning to stir properly is likened to the training montage in \"The Karate Kid\", where Mr. Miyagi teaches karate through repetitive, everyday tasks. This builds skill through mastering seemingly inconsequential actions which become natural over time.\n\n**Technique**:\n1. Master control of the bar spoon in the mixing glass.\n2. Understand the movement: it's not stirring per se, but allowing the outside of the spoon to travel along the inside of the glass’s bevel.\n3. Introduce ice and liquid gradually.\n4. Aim to stir as quietly as possible, with only a gentle rattle of ice. The goal is to never agitate the liquid beyond this gentle movement.\n\nThe document uses the metaphor of martial arts training to convey the precision and mindful approach required in the art of stirring cocktails, emphasizing technique and the subtle control of the stirring action."

Un chocolatier éminent m’a dit que les possibilités pour faire varier la saveur du chocolat blanc sont si limitées qu’aucune marque de qualité n’offre plus d’une variété dans sa gamme de produits. Le beurre de cacao un peu goût fort, mais qui n’est pas nécessairement présent, et presque tous les fabricants de chocolat réduisent l’odeur du beurre de cacao dans leurs produits, même si certains processus, comme la pasteurisation, suppriment également des saveurs.  \n**La torréfaction légère des fèves peut contourner le problème.**  \n*Cela dit, le fabricant de chocolat vénézuélien El Rey n’intervient pas sur l’odeur du beurre de cacao, et on dit souvent que leur chocolat blanc fait avec 34 % de beurre de cacao est l’un des meilleurs du marché.*  \nDe fait, il flait partie des croûtes sucrés et son goût est puissant.  \n*Le chocolat blanc naturel de Green & Black’s est moins de grandes de vanille Bourbon et possède un goût onctueux de crème glacée à la vanille, avec des notes de fraise et de cognac abricoté qui rappellent que le chocolat blanc peut tirer parti d’un rééquilibrage par des saveurs acídulées.*\n\n#### Chocolat blanc & Amande  \n**Le chocolat blanc est très doux**, car il lui manque la robustesse du cacao qui donne au chocolat au lait, mais surtout au noir, son amertume équilibrée. Les amandes, surtout grillées, peuvent contribuer à diluer cette douceur excessive, et c’est certainement ce qu’à pensé Nestlé en lançant dans les années 1940 la première barre de chocolat blanc.  \nVous pouvez les combiner vous-même. Faites griller au four à 180 °C (thermostat 6) 150 g d’amandes blanchies, durant 10 minutes, jusqu’à ce qu’elles soient légèrement dorées et réservez. Tapiesez une plaque à pâtisserie de papier sulfurisé. Mettez 200 g de chocolat blanc à chauffer au bain-marie.  \n**Lorsqu’il est complètement fondu, incorporez les amandes,** puis étalez le mélange sur la plaque. Gardez à l’esprit que vous devrez le casser en morceaux, donc faites en sorte que le mélange conserve un peu d’épaisseur. Laissez refroidir, puis placez au réfrigérateur pour qu’il retrouve une consistante ferme. Vous pouvez ajouter quelques griottes séchées, cela lui donnera un peu de mordant.\n\n#### Chocolat blanc & Ananas  \n**Le chocolat blanc est un ami proche des fruits rouges,** mais il fonctionne également bien avec les fruits tropicaux. Pensez aux notes d’ananans et de fruit de la Passion qui complètent celle de vanille dans le chardonnay vieilli en fut de chène.\n\n#### Chocolat blanc & Café  \nD’après moi, combiner du café avec l’intense saveur lactée du chocolat blanc pourrait rappeler un peu trop le café au lait qui sent le caramel cuit en cours sur parfois avec du lait UHT. Le lait UHT est stérilisé à très haute température, ce qui provoque une réaction de Maillard qui donne au lait des caractéristiques de caramel sucré, absentes dans le lait frais. Je pense que la meilleure combinaison chocolat blanc et café se trouve dans les tablettes françaises de Maillart qui permet l’un café au lait qui est au caramel sans être trop sucré ou prononcé."

Here's a breakdown of the structured content:\n\n### Potential pairing: olive oil and chocolate\n- **Description**: Olive oil, chocolate, and sea salt are a traditional combination in Catalonia. The concept is to drizzle slices of bread with oil, add shavings of dark chocolate and finish with coarse flakes of salt. Variations include chocolate mousse sprinkled with sea salt and drizzled with olive oil, served with thin slices of toasted bread.\n\n### Potential pairing: olive oil and pound cake\n- **Description**: Known as gâteau quatre-quarts (four quarters cake) in French, this cake is typically made with equal weights of flour, eggs, sugar, and butter. For a variation using olive oil, replace butter with olive oil and consider adding peach or replace part of the flour with ground hazelnuts.\n\n### Why your vinaigrette can end up tasting bitter\n- **Issue**: Using extra-virgin olive oil in vinaigrettes may result in a bitter taste when blended improperly due to polyphenols which prevent them from dispersing freely in liquid.\n- **Advice**: To avoid bitterness, blend olive oil gently with vinegar, perhaps by emulsifying manually instead of using high-speed devices. Also, milder-flavored sauces like pesto do well with olive oil despite the potential for bitterness because its bitterness is often imperceptible in strongly flavored dishes.\n\n### Rice pudding with olive oil & orange\n- **Chef**: María José San Román, Monastrell, Alicante, Spain\n- **Details**:\n  - **Signature Ingredients**: Saffron, Spanish Arbequina olive oil, Alicante pomegranates, and orange.\n  - **Cooking Technique**: Half of the cooking water for rice is replaced with orange juice infused with cinnamon.\n  - **Serving suggestions**: The pudding is sweetened with orange confiture, drizzled with extra-virgin Spanish Arbequina olive oil instead of butter, and sprinkled with brown sugar and broiled to brûlée the top. Citrus chunks are also added for accentuation."

Here's a structured overview of the flowchart content:\n\n1. **Starting Material: Sorghum Grain**\n   - **95%** is used to make fine grain flour.\n   - **5%** undergoes germination to produce sorghum malt, which is then made into coarse malt flour.\n\n2. **Processes**\n   - Fine grain flour and an equal amount of water (by volume) are mixed:\n     - One part is used to make half-cooked porridge (Futtara naya), then cooled on coal.\n     - Another part is used to make well-cooked porridge (Futtara majida), then allowed to cool.\n   - Coarse malt flour undergoes souring fermentation to produce Ajin.\n   - Subsequently, it is mixed for alcoholic fermentation:\n     - Over-roasted granules (Surij) are mixed with cooled coarse malt flour, Merissa (10%), and water (67%) to initiate alcoholic fermentation (Debaba).\n     - The mixture is then combined with cooled Futtara porridge and kneaded with 5% coarse malt flour.\n     - This leads to the alcoholic Merissa fermentation proper.\n\n3. **Post-Fermentation Processes**\n   - After fermentation, additional water (33%) is added.\n   - The mixture is strained with a cloth bag to separate the liquid from the residue (Mushuk).\n   - The remaining liquid (Degge Merissa) can then be separated into Mahoj Merissa.\n   - The Mushuk residue can be used as animal feed.\n\nThis detailed process illustrates traditional methods and cultural practices in the production of sorghum-based alcoholic beverages in Sudan."

Soak soybeans overnight.\n2. Steam them until soft.\n3. Cool to body temperature.\n4. Inoculate with soy *koji* (reference: \"Making Koji\", chapter 10, temperatures 80-90°F/27-32°C).\n5. Incubate for 48 hours or longer to allow mold sporulation.\n6. Once mold sporulates, dry beans either in sun or a dehydrator until crispy (not required to be 100% dry).\n7. Ideal moisture content cited by a USDA scientist for commercial production is around 12%.\n   - Exact precision in moisture content is not crucial, but beans should be mostly dry while retaining some moisture.\n\nThis summary provides insights into the traditional and practical aspects of fermenting soybeans, highlighting cultural significance and procedural details."
