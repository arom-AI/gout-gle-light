The dry whites from Menetou-Salon are also from this easternmost part of the Loire, as are the less well-known regions of Reuilly and Quincy.

It’s no longer a completely far-fetched idea. As of the early twentieth century, most states in the U.S. had wine industries. But a combination of Prohibition, vine diseases for which there was then no remedy, and the Great Depression led farmers to pursue other crops in place of wine grapes. Today, the situation has completely turned around. All fifty states now have established wine industries.

    "contenu": "# Crustaceans\n\n**Cooking lobster, crab, shrimp, and crayfish alters the flavor of these crustaceans, which have an otherwise bland aroma profile that is mostly characterized by a green, somewhat fishy smell. Unlike other fish and shellfish, cooked crustaceans have a mostly meaty and nutty, popcorn-like scent.**\n\nAs well as developing a different flavor profile, lobsters, crabs, prawns and crayfish also turn red when cooked. This is because they contain a protein called crustacyanin that is filled with astaxanthin, a type of red dye. The cooking process denatures the crustacyanin, causing the red dye to be released into the crustaceans' shells and flesh.\n\n### Lobster\nIf you have ever treated yourself to a fancy meal of lobster, chances are your food was caught somewhere along the rocky seabed of the Atlantic Ocean. American and European lobsters thrive in cold water temperatures of about 12–18°C (54–65°F). Armed with a powerful set of large front claws, these cold-water lobsters have sweeter, silkier flesh than their warm-water cousins.\n\nThe American Maine lobster (*Homarus americanus*) and European Breton lobsters (*Homarus gammarus*) are the two most commercially fished species of lobsters. In Europe, the Oosterschelde lobster is considered a delicacy. Their dark blueish-black exoskeletons are marked with orange spots that enable fishermen to find them hidden among the craggy rocks along the Netherland’s Eastern Scheldt, where they are sustainably caught.\n\n**Related aroma profile: boiled brown crab meat**\nCooked brown crab shares many of the same meaty, nutty, popcorn, and vegetal potato-like aroma compounds as boiled lobster. Crab meat also has a markedly green scent, similar to that of langoustines. Cooking these crustaceans causes the formation of fruity-scented esters.\n\n### Brown crab\nBrown crabs dwell in the shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean, from the North Sea all the way down to North Africa. With their black-tipped claws, these scavengers easily adapt to their habitats and make up a sizable portion of the western European seafood industry's catch. The white meat in a brown crab’s body claws makes up approximately one-third of its entire body weight. The rest of the meat in its body is referred to as brown meat. Males tend to have sweeter-tasting claw meat than females.\n\n### Tips for serving crustaceans:\n- **Lobster**: To savor the sweet, tender flesh of fresh lobster at its best, keep it simple: steam it just right and serve it with a squeeze of lemon juice and warm drawn butter.\n- **Lobster Bellevue**: This is an arrangement of chilled lobster tail served on a bed of lettuce with soft-boiled eggs, tomatoes, and dollops of mayonnaise and cocktail sauce.\n- **Lobster Newberg**: This dish calls for cooked lobster in a creamy sauce flavored with cognac, sherry, brandy or Madeira and a dash of Tabasco sauce or cayenne pepper, served with toast points.\n- **Lobster à l'Américaine**: This is served in a rich, creamy cognac-infused tomato sauce made from its own shells and finished with fresh minced parsley and tarragon.\n\n- **Classic Belgian crab cocktail**: This dish calls for the same ingredients as lobster Bellevue, except that it is served in a glass. Newer versions containing avocado, lettuce, grapefruit, and cocktail sauce have also started popping up.\n\nThe included graphical information can be seen below:\n\n- Phenolic compounds arranged in a circular diagram, related to various ingredients and food items sampled from the text."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects of kimchi, a traditional Korean dish made from fermented vegetables. It highlights the diversity in kimchi preparation and the science behind its fermentation process. Here is a structured overview of the content:\n\n1. **Variety in Kimchi Spiciness and Ingredients:**\n   - Kimchi can range from extremely spicy to completely mild. It’s available in different varieties including those without any hot peppers, such as \"mul\" or water kimchi.\n   - A specific example is provided about a \"white\" kimchi, which is less spicy and considered a cooling summer variety. It is mentioned that there is flexibility in the recipe, with personal touches like adding a bit of pepper for a zesty tang and color change.\n\n2. **Fermentation Process:**\n   - The quality of kimchi is influenced by its fermentation time, which is ideally shorter and conducted in a cooler environment to attain peak taste and limited acidity.\n   - The optimal taste is reportedly achieved with a three-day fermentation at 20°C (68°F) using 3 percent salt, based on findings from a team of Korean academics.\n   - The fermentation involves various bacteria, transitioning from early-stage bacteria like \"Leuconostoc mesenteroides\" to more acid-tolerant \"Lactobacillus plantarum.\" The former is crucial in the early stages of kimchi fermentation, while the latter, although beneficial in sauerkraut fermentation, is less favorable for kimchi as it deteriorates its quality.\n\n3. **Carbon Dioxide and Fizziness in Kimchi:**\n   - Some kimchi varieties exhibit fizziness due to robust CO2 production in the initial stages of fermentation. As the acidity in kimchi increases, the CO2 production decreases. For a fizzier kimchi, continual fermentation in a less acidic environment is recommended.\n\nThis summary reflects the document’s focus on explaining how the ingredients and conditions of kimchi fermentation contribute to its variety and quality characteristics."

The content focuses on two main topics within the context of white winemaking: the use of Pinot Grigio grapes in north-east Italy and the technique of lees stirring in winemaking. Below is the structured content from the page:\n\n### White and Sweet Winemaking\n\n#### Image Descriptions\n1. **Lees Stirring:** A rod is used inside a wine barrel to stir the lees (sediment).\n2. **Procedure for Lees Stirring:**\n   - The winemaker uses a rod to stir the lees in the barrel. The rod is lowered to the bottom where a layer of lees has collected over time.\n   - The rod is dragged through the lees to stir them up.\n   - With continuous stirring, the lees become fully mixed into the wine.\n3. **Images showing different stages or angles of the barrel during lees stirring**\n\n#### Text Content\n\n**Giulia's Pinot Grigio Wines**\n- High-quality Pinot Grigio wines are produced in Giulia, north-east Italy, typically in a dry style. These wines exhibit greater depth of flavor than cheaper mechanisms largely due to the climate and contributions from premium clones known for intense skin and fruit concentration.\n- The wines benefit from early harvesting, high yield rates, and the favorable climatic conditions of the region.\n\n**Winemaking Choices**\n- The process involves critical decisions on the grape varieties to use.\n- Techniques such as crushing grapes entirely or using whole bunches affects aging possibilities due to non-oxygenic grape varieties being subjected to controlled exposure to aromatic agents.\n- Techniques like aging in concrete and large barrels, and the use of specific methods like lees stirring, are employed to retain freshness but also give complexity and a creamier mouthfeel.\n\n**Fermentation Vessels**\n- Different containers such as stainless steel or concrete may be employed for fermenting to refresh the fruit flavors and maintain freshness. For Pinot Gris in regions like Alsace, stainless steel and concrete alongside large wooden barrels are common vessels used.\n- New Zealand Pinot Gris may stop fermentation early to maintain sugar and ripeness levels naturally through different methods like adding sulphur dioxide (SO2).\n\n- Matured wines may opt for small amounts of maturation post-fermentation or may choose to use concrete tanks and large barrels to impart a creamy texture and complexity to wines particularly from regions like Burgundy where a creamy mouthfeel is preferred.\n\nThis structured content identifies different winemaking techniques, elaborates on geographic specificity, and discusses choice impacts concerning flavor, texture, and overall complexity in wine production."

The vineyards run north to south in one long, thin strip over the foothills along the eastern flank of the Vosges Mountains. Germany’s Rhine River is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) to the east, and even closer (about 6 miles/10 kilometers to the east) is Alsace’s river, Ill (pronounced EEL).\n\nAfter Champagne, this is France’s northernmost wine region, yet it is not generally overcast and cool, as one might presume, but surprisingly sunny and dry. Thanks to the protective mantle of the Vosges Mountains, less rain falls on the vineyards here than on vineyards elsewhere in France.\n\nThe best vineyards are south-facing for maximum sun, and most are located in the southern part of the region, known as the Haut Rhine or upper Rhine. The growing season is long, ensuring that even at this northern latitude, grapes growing in the best, sunniest sites develop full physiological maturity.\n\nSoil in Alsace is varied enough to be a geologist’s dream. Wide variations in soil often mean wide variations in the flavor and quality of the wines. And, in fact, there is an enormous difference in flavor between an average wine from a nondescript vineyard and a wine from an extraordinary vineyard, such as Trimbach’s Clos Ste.-Hune, which produces one of the greatest rieslings in the world.\n\nThe checkerboard of soil types in Alsace includes chalk combined with clay, limestone, granite, schist, volcanic rock sediment, and sandstone. Alsace’s pinkish-colored sandstone, called grès de Vosges, is a favorite building material for local cathedrals.\n\n### THE MOST IMPORTANT ALSACE WINES\n\n#### LEADING WINES\n- **GEWÜRZTRAMINER** white (dry and sweet)\n- **MUSCAT** white (dry and sweet)\n- **PINOT GRIS** white (dry and sweet)\n- **RIESLING** white (dry and sweet)\n\n#### WINES OF NOTE\n- **CRÉMANT D'ALSACE** white (sparkling)\n- **PINOT BLANC** white\n- **PINOT NOIR** red\n\nThis structure provides a clear overview of the Alsace wine region, highlighting its geographical and climatic features, as well as prominent wines produced in the area."

Ensure you have added three times the volume of sorghum meal to the volume of unmalted sorghum (merissa).\n \n2. **Adding Water:** Add water equivalent to the total volume of sorghum used. Upon adding water, active fermentation starts quickly.\n\n3. **Taste Testing and Adjustment:** The brewer tests surij by tasting the mash periodically to determine if it has become sweet enough. If it hasn’t, more malt is added as required.\n\n4. **Description of Deboba:** Once ready, the deboba (fermented mixture) resembles a dark, thick sludge with a bitter taste. It requires close monitoring during fermentation to ensure proper taste development.\n\n### Merissa Fermentation Process\n\n1. **Fermentation Duration:** The deboba ferments for about seven hours before the next ingredient must be added.\n\n2. **Preparing for Next Steps:** Flour is prepared at least an hour or two before this seven-hour mark, to ensure it can be added in time.\n\n### Preparation of Acédas (Porridges)\n\n1. **Cooking the Porridges:** Two types of porridge, aceda, are prepared differently; one fully cooked and the other half-cooked.\n\n2. **Mixing Porridges:** Once cooled, both types of aceda are mixed together to form a dough called futtara.\n\n3. **Theoretical Appreciation:** The combination of fully cooked and undercooked porridges is thought to optimize the ratio from ungelatinized to gelatinized starches. This mix adds a required gritty texture and enhances the palette feel, improving consumer satisfaction.\n\n4. **Porridge Making Instructions:**\n   - Fill a pot with fresh cold water, approximately three times the volume of the flour.\n   - Sprinkle flour over the water as it heats and bring to a boil.\n   - Stir vigorously to mix the flour into the water, break up lumps and ensure the flour absorbs all the water while thickening.\n   - Test doneness by pressing a wet finger into the aceda; it should come away clean, and the porridge should have a bounce-back feel. If necessary, additional cooking and stirring may be required.\n\n### General Tips\n\n- The instructions recommend maintaining strict control of volumes and temperatures and conducting periodic tasting to ensure the desired taste and texture of the brew."

The World's Best Region for Riesling: Germany\n- **Summary**: Riesling, often misunderstood and regarded as a beginner wine, is highly valued for its versatility and range of styles; from dry to sweet, and flinty to peachy. Germany is acknowledged as producing the best Rieslings.\n- **Runner-Up**: Alsace, France. In Alsace, the approach to Riesling yields wines that are stronger and fuller than those from Germany, yet are still considered among the world's most stylish and food-friendly white wines.\n\n### Arnie's Corner\n- **Summary**: This section reflects on the importance of traditional wine regions in shaping modern perceptions of quality wine. Vintners from these regions have refined their wine-making techniques over centuries, which has influenced other wine-makers globally, particularly those following the French or German wine paradigms."

These include vintage Port, single-quinta vintage Port, traditional late-bottled vintage Port, and crusted Port. None of the other styles throw a sufficient sediment.\n\nDecanting Port is very easy. Since Port sediment is heavy relative to the sediment thrown by other wines (see page 134 for more information on sediment), it tends to stick to the sides of a bottle lying on its side in a cellar. So, all you need to do is handle the bottle gently and pour slowly into the carafe or glasses, taking care not to shake up the contents of the bottle. If possible, it’s helpful to stand the bottle of Port up for a day ahead so that much of the sediment sinks to the bottom of the bottle.\n\n*The mind-blowing richness of Port starts with its hedonistic aromas.*\n\nDepending on how old and delicate the wine is, it could be decanted many hours before it is to be served—or just before. This is a judgment call to be sure, but it is better to err on the side of less oxygen exposure, because the wine will get another big dose of oxygen when it’s poured into the glasses.\n\nAs for serving, one of the oldest and most curious Port traditions concerns the direction in which a bottle is passed around the table. By custom, Port is always supposed to be passed from the right to the left, in a clockwise direction. Although the origins of the custom are obscure, research by the house of Sandeman suggests the practice is based on the old Celtic belief that all circular motions should be deiseal, that is, turning in a way such that a person moving in a circle would have his right hand toward the center. The word deiseal is derived from the Celtic deas, meaning \"right hand,\" and iul, meaning \"direction.\""

    "contenu": "## Handling Spewing Bottles\n\nWhen bottles are opened, carbonated beverages may spew due to pressure. To manage this:\n\n- **Chill the Bottles:** Always chill bottles before opening to reduce the pressure.\n- **Use a Bowl:** Open the bottle over a clean bowl positioned in a sink to catch any overflow.\n- **Open Gradually:** Start by opening the bottle slowly. If a large amount of foam begins to rise, immediately close the bottle and wait for the foam to settle before trying again.\n- **Repeat if Necessary:** Repeat the opening process multiple times until the beverage can be opened without excessive foaming.\n- **Moderation is Key:** Enjoy carbonated beverages in moderation as excessive carbonation can lead to waste and potentially dangerous situations.\n\n## Ginger Beer with Ginger Bug\n\nGinger beer is a beloved homemade soda, known for its versatile flavor that can range from mildly to intensely gingered.\n\n- **Base Ingredients:** Ginger beer is primarily made from ginger, sugar, and water.\n- **Use of Ginger Bug:** A ginger bug, which is a simple starter made from ginger, sugar, and water, can be used to ferment the beverage or as a starter for other drinks.\n- **Alternative Starters:** Other starter options for brewing ginger beer include water kefir and whey.\n\n### Starting a Ginger Bug\n\nStarting a ginger bug is straightforward:\n\n1. **Prepare Ingredients:** Grate some ginger, skin on, and place it in a small jar.\n2. **Add Water and Sugar:** Fill the jar with water and add sugar.\n3. **Stir Frequently:** Stir the mixture regularly and add more grated ginger and sugar daily.\n4. **Wait for Fermentation:** Continue this process for a few days until the jar contents become vigorously bubbly. This indicates active fermentation, typically due to the natural yeasts and lactic acid bacteria in the ginger.\n\n**Note on Ginger Quality:** Some reports suggest that ginger in the US might not always ferment due to irradiation processes that kill bacteria and yeast, impacting its natural ability to ferment. Organic ginger is recommended as it is not irradiated ensuring the integrity of its natural microbes.\n\n### Caution:\n\n- **Handling Carbonation:** Always handle carbonated beverages like ginger beer cautiously due to the potential for excessive pressure build-up.\n- **Quality of Ingredients:** Ensure the quality of ginger used to promote effective fermentation and avoid issues with non-fermenting ginger bugs."

Erol mentions his surprise at the longevity of Uncle Van’s *viili* culture, contrasting it with commercial viili. \n   - He compares the situation to commercial yogurt, suggesting that reliance on lab-bred cultures might not maintain all necessary organisms for traditional *viili*.\n\n4. **Response from Betty**:\n   - Betty emphasizes the value of traditional *viili*, suggesting commercial versions lack the full spectrum of necessary organisms.\n   - She hints at deeper ecological interactions in traditional *viili* cultures, not fully replicated in commercial versions.\n\n## Interpretation:\nThe text underscores the value of traditional food practices in maintaining biological and cultural diversity. It criticizes the standardization inherent in commercial food production, which often neglects the complexity of traditional methods and their ecological co-adaptations.\n```"
