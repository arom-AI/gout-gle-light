Think of it as the \"Goldilocks Rule”: not too light, not too heavy, not too sweet, not too dry—just right. When you’re entertaining more than twenty people, it’s hard to go wrong with styles whose strong suit is moderation. Midweight wines are the way to go to please most of the people most of the time; Italian Pinot Grigio will have wider appeal than whisper-light Vinho Verde or heavier Chardonnay. The same applies to flavor profile: Red wines with a midrange dark fruit flavor, such as Merlot or Shiraz, will be better received than a sharp cranberry-ish Bourgogne or a dense, raisiny, old vine Zinfandel.\n\n*Source: Wine in Restaurants, Page 155*"

    "contenu": "### **Sonoma County**\n\nDirectly north of San Francisco and bordering the Pacific Ocean, Sonoma County has 1 million acres (404,700 hectares) of land, making it more than two times bigger than its next-door neighbor, Napa Valley. Sonoma’s size means, among other things, that the county is a geographical patchwork quilt of valleys, mountains, riverbeds, plains, and slight uplifts in the terrain, known as benchlands. Within this shifting landscape are sixteen viticultural areas that can be quite different in their nuances of climate and soil.\n\nFrom a historical, psychosocial, and cultural standpoint, Sonoma County is rather different from Napa. Vineyards were planted here as the nineteenth century dawned, well before they were planted in Napa, and many vintners and winemakers are members of old, established farming families. A kicked-back country style pervades much of the region. People drive around in dusty pickups, no one puts on the ritz very much, and when Sonomans do get together, the talk is as likely to be about tractors as about wine sales in Tokyo. But be assured, among the top producers there’s as much cutting-edge wine stuff happening in Sonoma as anywhere in California.\n\nThe county itself is beautifully pastoral, and is often called California’s Provence. Vineyards alternate with apple orchards, vegetable farms, redwood forests, dairies (cheese is a local specialty), sheep ranches, nurseries (including dozens of Christmas tree farms), and even aquaculture fisheries along the rugged coast. Sonoma boasts one of the best bakeries west of the Mississippi (the Downtown Bakery, in Healdsburg), the first commercial shiitake mushroom farm in the United States, plus the Dry Creek General Store, a funky, old-fashioned general store, but on Saturday night, if you’re single and in the wine industry, count on it being the place to hang out (everyone sits on the front porch and drinks beer)."

It is structured into two main sections: \"Storage of Wine\" and \"Service of Wine\".\n\n### Storage of Wine:\n- **Key Points**:\n  1. **Temperature**: For long-term storage, maintain a constant temperature between 10°C and 15°C to avoid extremes of cold and heat which can damage the wine.\n  2. **Location**: Avoid storing wine in the kitchen where temperature fluctuations are common. \n  3. **Refrigeration Concerns**: Long periods in refrigeration can harden corks and cause them to lose elasticity, which can lead wine to become stale.\n  4. **Light Exposure**: Keep wines away from strong light and natural sunshine as it can heat the wine and cause unpleasant flavors to develop.\n  5. **Positioning**: Bottles with corks should remain in contact with the wine to prevent the cork from drying out and air from oxidizing the wine. Screw cap wines can be stored standing up without risk.\n  6. **Vibrations**: Store wines in a place where they can remain undisturbed without vibrations.\n\n### Service of Wine:\n- **Service Temperatures**:\n  - A list of recommended service temperatures for all styles of wine is provided, considering whether the wine is in room temperature environments which is common due to air-conditioning and central heating. Methods to warm red wines without causing damage are also mentioned.\n\nHere is the table extracted from the section \"Service of Wine\" detailing the style of wine, example wines, and their service temperatures:\n\n| STYLE OF WINE       | EXAMPLE OF STYLE OF WINE             | SERVICE TEMPERATURE          |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Medium/full-bodied, oaked white wines | White Burgundy, Fumé Blanc           | Lightly chilled 10–13°C (50–55°F) |\n| Light/medium-bodied white wines       | Muscadet, Pinot Grigio, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Fino Sherry | Chilled 7–10°C (45–50°F)             |\n| Sweet wines                           | Sauternes, Gewürztraminer            | Well chilled 6–8°C (43–45°F)         |\n| Sparkling wines                       | Champagne, Cava, Asti                | Well chilled 6–10°C (43–50°F)        |\n| Light-bodied red wines                | Beaujolais, Valpolicella             | Lightly chilled 13°C (55°F)          |\n| Medium/full-bodied red wines          | Red Bordeaux, Rioja, Australian Shiraz, Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Barolo, Amarone della Valpolicella, Vintage Port | Room temperature 15–18°C (59–64°F)   |\n\nThe document emphasizes that correctly storing and serving wine at the stated conditions will help preserve the quality and enhance the enjoyment of wine."

Here's a structured summary of the content provided in the document:\n\n### Austria\n\n**Introduction**\n- Austria is renowned for its dry white wines, primarily from its native grape varieties Grüner Veltliner and Riesling.\n- Austria also produces fine red wines from local varieties like Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch, and sweet botrytised dessert wines made from Welschriesling.\n\n**Climate and Grape Growing**\n- The Alps cover the western parts of Austria, leading to cool, continental climate conditions ideal for wine production.\n- The climate includes short summers and very harsh winters. The northern border areas experience cooling northern winds, while those close to the Hungarian border are warmed by easterly winds.\n\n**Grape Varieties and Winemaking**\n- **White Grape Varieties:**\n  - **Grüner Veltliner:** Most widely planted, known for its high-quality, dry character with spice hints and touch fruit undertones.\n  - Other white varieties include Müller-Thurgau and Sauvignon Blanc, gaining popularity in Southern Austria.\n\n- **Black Grape Varieties:**\n  - **Zweigelt (Blaufränkisch x St Laurent):** Known for its soft tannins and bramble fruit, it's the most highly regarded of the Austrian black varieties.\n\n**Austrian Wine Laws**\n- Majority of wine in Austria is PDO. Wines labeled as **Landwein** are without geographical indication, called **Wein**.\n  - PDO Wines: Defined by four federal states and 16 smaller areas that qualify for PDO status with either status **Qualitätswein** or DAC.\n  - **Qualitätswein** can be made from 35 permitted grape varieties in any style and might also be labeled with a **Prädikat** level reflecting sweetness, such as **Ausbruch**, which classifies between **Beerenauslese (BA)** and **Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA)**.\n\n- **DAC (Districtus Austriae Controllatus):**\n  - Available in nine smaller wine regions, DAC indicates a regional specialty under specific varieties and style. Wines not conforming to DAC standards in these areas default to the regional or federal state appellation, without using the DAC name.\n\nThis summary captures the critical information discussed in the document concerning Austria's significant role and regulations in wine production."

Before the 1980s, it was also called \"syrah\",\n  \"shiraz\", or \"hermitage\" (an official, protected appellation in France's Rhône Valley).\n- Australians referred to the grape by various names until legal restrictions in France led to the consistent use of \"Shiraz\" in Australia.\n- DNA research has disproved that the grape originated in Persia, revealing it to be native to east-central France.\n- The name variations like schiras, syrac, syra, syrac, serine, and sereine show its linguistic evolution. \n\n**Aromas and Flavors in Australian Shiraz**\n- Eucalyptus is noted as a distinctive aroma and flavor in many Australian wines, particularly Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. This is attributed to many vines being located near eucalyptus trees, leading to the absorption of these character notes into the grapes and wine.\n- Shiraz wines from Australia are renowned for their rich, hedonistic berry flavors, soft textures, and hints of gaminess and iron, making them quite distinct from French Syrahs.\n- Cooler climate Australian Shirazes are known to have more spice and savor while warmer climates favor rich, dark fruit flavors mixed with chocolate and mineral notes.\n\n**Examples Mentioned**\n- Variants like Shiraz/Grenache can exhibit a blend of cherries, chocolate, and mineral flavors, with specific references to producers like S.C. Pannell (McLaren Vale) and Charles Melton, which underscore the diverse crafting styles across regions in Australia."

    "contenu": "### Effects on Living Things\nOne consequence of alcohol’s chemical versatility is that it readily penetrates the membranes of living cells, which are made in part of fat-like molecules. When it does so, it disturbs the action of the membrane proteins. A high enough concentration of alcohol will cause such a disturbance that this critical boundary between cell and environment fails, and the cell dies. The yeasts that produce alcohol can tolerate a concentration of about 20%, and most other microbes are killed by much less. When the solution also contains acid or sugar, as in wines, alcohol is an even more effective microbial poison. This is why, unlike beer and wine, distilled spirits and such alcohol-fortified wines as sherry and port don’t spoil after they’re opened.\n\nOur own pleasant inebriation when we drink alcohol is in part a symptom of mild membrane and protein disturbance throughout our nervous system.\n\n### Alcohol as a Drug: Intoxication\nAlcohol is a drug: it alters the operation of the various tissues into which it diffuses. We value it most for its influence on the central nervous system, where it acts as a narcotic. The fact that it seems to stimulate more animated, excited behavior than usual is actually a symptom of its depressant effect on the higher functions of the brain, those that normally control our behavior with various kinds of inhibition. As more alcohol reaches the brain, it interferes with more basic processes: memory, concentration, and thinking in general; muscular coordination, speech, vision. With regard to the idea that alcohol is an aphrodisiac, modern investigators continue to cite the authority of the Porter in Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*, who says of drink that “Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.”\n\nThe degree to which someone is intoxicated depends on the concentration of alcohol in the cells. Once alcohol is absorbed from the digestive tract, the blood rapidly distributes it to all body fluids, and it readily diffuses into and across membranes to penetrate all cells. Large people can therefore drink more than small people without being drunker: they have a greater volume of body fluids and cells in which to dilute the alcohol. Impaired coordination and impulsive behavior usually appear when the concentration of alcohol in the blood is high.\n\n### The Source of Happiness and Oblivion\nObservers of the human condition have long remarked on the ways in which alcohol helps people deal with that condition. Here are two of the earliest and simplest formulations, from the Ayurvedic tradition of India, and from the Old Testament.\n\n- **Charaka-Samhita, ca. 400 BCE**\n  \"Wine is the foremost of all things that lead to cheerfulness. Abuse of wine is the foremost of all causes that lead to loss of intelligence and memory.\"\n\n- **Proverbs, ca. 500 BCE**\n  \"Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto them that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.\""

    "contenu": "The document discusses the process of making saké, particularly focusing on the initial steps involving the preparation of the moto (or shubo) and its maturation, which are crucial for the development of flavor and fermentation dynamics. Here is the extracted and structured content of the document:\n\n1. **Moto Preparation**\n   - **Ingredients**: A small amount of koji, freshly steamed rice, yeast starter.\n   - **Procedure**: The ingredients are mixed and allowed to bubble in a warm environment (70-73°F/21-23°C) for a few days.\n   - **Purpose**: This step activates the yeast and allows for the development of lactic acid, which prevents wild yeast and unwanted bacteria from proliferating and impacting the flavor.\n\n2. **Role of Lactic Acid**\n   - **Historical Context**: Early in the 20th century, it was found that adding lactic acid directly at the start of the process aids in speeding up and protecting the process.\n   - **Modern Practice**: Direct addition of lactic acid is known as Sokujio practice. It simplifies and speeds up the development of the moto compared to traditional methods where lactic acid develops slower, potentially introducing more diverse microbial activity.\n\n3. **Maturation of Moto**\n   - **Outcome**: After the initial preparation, moto may contain various microbes if lactic acid develops slowly, leading to a more complex flavor profile. The document notes a personal experiment using sourdough starter indicating robust flavor results from varied microbial activity.\n\n4. **Maturation Stages**\n   - **Initial Stage**: Once the moto is mature, the process continues with three successive stages of adding rice, koji, and water.\n   - **Stage Names and Procedures**:\n     - **Hatsuzoe**: Adding koji and water in the evening, followed by adding more rice the next morning.\n     - **Odori (Dancing Ferment)**: For two days after the hatsuzoe.\n     - **Nakazoe**: Doubling the previous addition of koji and rice; water is added the following morning.\n     - **Tomezo**: Doubling each component again after the nakazoe stage.\n     - **Final Incorporation**: Once all additions are done.\n\nThis process highlights the careful and structured approach required in traditional saké making, ensuring the development of desired flavors and alcohol content through controlled fermentation."

Your first move should be to scope out the restaurant’s attitude toward wine and, by extension, wine drinkers. This will help you determine whether you can feel safe in their hands or whether you should assume a defensive crouch to head off gustatory and financial ruin.\n\nWine service in restaurants varies widely. Even within a particular category—high-end steakhouses or casual burger joints—great variance exists in pricing policies, selling strategies, and levels of wine knowledge among staff. Some restaurants have soul-less wine programs, selling wine like widgets and squeezing every nickel out of it. In these eateries, you’ll often be expected to pay up to five times the retail price. By contrast, if you find yourself in a restaurant that truly cares about its wine service, you’ll likely find better wine for the dollar.\n\nTo help ascertain the type of restaurant you’re in, consult the wine list for clues.\n\n---\n\nOne of the country’s leading wine educators, **Mark Oldman** is the author of the best-selling *Oldman’s Guide to Outsmarting Wine*, which won the Duboeuf “Best Wine Book of the Year” award.
