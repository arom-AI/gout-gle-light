    "contenu": "# Tasting & Evaluating Spirits\n\nAlmost every day, one or more importers or producers stops by to share a new product with us. Death & Co has been lucky to play test bed for many important new releases in their infancy, often as early prototypes, as well as in their final tweaking stages. This is probably because importers and producers see the bar as a safe place to get an honest assessment of their product. Our bartenders don't hold back on their opinions. If they love what they taste, they'll say so; if they hate it, they'll be equally unabashed.\n\nWhen tasting a new product, we follow a methodology taught by the gents at Beverage Alcohol Resource (see Resources), which we think is the best way to evaluate its merits. Here are the general rules:\n\n## Always Taste With Someone Else\nIt doesn’t matter whether others are inexperienced tasters or their preferences are wildly different than your own. Tasting and evaluating spirits by yourself is a bad idea because a monologue is never as productive as a dialogue. When tasting, we like to gather bartenders and other staff as well.\n\n## Set Up Some Baseline Comparisons\nA tasting is only valuable if it's done comparatively. We don’t pit products against one another in the spirit of one-upmanship, but rather to start a conversation and, often, a debate. Having something to relate the product to is vital in establishing a baseline. We usually do this in a blind tasting of several spirits in the same category, such as an array of mezcals, rye whiskeys, or gins. We often include our favorite bottles in this tasting—again, served blind—as a point of comparison.\n\n## Establish a Purpose for the Tasting\nSometimes we're tasting a spirit to determine its quality. In those instances, we always taste the unadulterated spirit first: just the product in a glass. But more often than not, we're tasting to determine the best application for a spirit: how we can best use this product in a cocktail and whether it's better than what we already use. To determine this, after first tasting individual spirits, we do another round of tasting using the spirits in simple, well-known cocktails. Rums are tested in a daiquiri, whiskeys in a Manhattan or an old-fashioned, gins in a martini, and so on.\n\n## Taste The Spirit\nAfter assembling your spirits—not only the new product that's to be analyzed but also a couple of comparative examples—start tasting. Keep a glass of water handy for cleansing your palate and, if needed, diluting any high-proof samples so they can reveal all of their potential. Begin by nosing the spirit. Spirits have a lot higher alcohol content than beer and wine, and if you were to smell them as you would wine, you’d quickly burn your nose and ruin the whole exercise. For this reason, you should bring the glass up close to your nose, open your mouth, and breathe in. This simple action allows you to bypass the strong alcohol and get to the spirit’s underlying aroma. After a few smells, discuss what you notice with your cohorts. Use the first sip to rinse any lingering flavors in your mouth, left over from your last cup of coffee, meal, cigarette, or what have you. Then take two more sips, swirling the spirit in your mouth and pausing between sips to chat about what you’re tasting. Add a small amount of water as necessary if the alcohol is getting in the way of the spirit’s aromas and flavors."

The best known species is the fatty \"Chilean sea bass,\" which is an erroneous yet popular commercial term for the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Notable for containing up to 15% fat largely stored beneath its skin, this species is celebrated for its thick, flaky flesh, and is severely threatened by overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate and its popularity.\n\n### TUNAS AND MACKEREL\nTunas are described as remarkable sea creatures, being large predators of the open ocean. They can weigh up to 1,500 lb (680 kg) and are distinguished by their ability to swim continuously at speeds reaching 40 miles per hour (70 km/h). The text emphasizes tunas' fatty tissues like the belly or toro, especially the bluefin tuna, sought after for its high fat content and velvety texture, fetching high market prices. These species thrive in cooler waters, where they accumulate more fat, beneficial for both their survival and culinary value.\n\n### The Tuna Family\n\nThe table provides specific information about various types of tuna species found around the world:\n\n| Common Name | Scientific Name     | Abundance | Size            | Fat Content, % |\n|-------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Bluefin     | Thunnus thynnus (northern); T. maccoyii (southern) | very rare  | up to 1500 lb/675 kg | 15             |\n| Bigeye, ahi | T. obesus            | rare      | 20–200 lb/9–90 kg | 8              |\n| Yellowfin, ahi | T. albacares      | abundant  | 3–200 lb/1–90 kg  | 2              |\n| Albacore    | T. alalunga          | abundant  | 20–45 lb/9–20 kg  | 7              |\n| Skipjack    | Katsuwonus pelamis   | abundant  | 4–40 lb/2–20 kg   | 2.5            |\n\n---\n\nThis summary captures the important details regarding two significant marine families highlighted in the document and details their biological and ecological characteristics important for both environmental and commercial contexts."

    "contenu": "The content of the document discusses the unique aspects of salami production that contribute to its fermentation, preservation, and flavor.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points about Salami Production:**\n\n1. **Fermentation Process Enhancement:**\n   - **Mincing or Grinding Meat:** This increases the surface area of the meat, facilitating better contact with fermentation organisms along with spoilage organisms and potential pathogens. Increased surface area also makes more nutrients available to these organisms.\n   - **Addition of Ingredients:** Ingredients such as salt, curing salts, spices, and carbohydrates are added during the mincing process, helping to nourish lactic acid bacteria and starter cultures. This ensures an even distribution throughout the meat.\n   \n2. **Protective Casing:**\n   - **Use of Animal Intestines:** Salamis are encased in animal intestines which provide dual benefits. These casings are robust enough to defend against airborne contaminants but also porous enough to allow the meat to \"breathe\". This explanation is attributed to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.\n   - **Function of Intestinal Tubes:** Their special quality is highlighted by their capability to prevent contaminants while allowing the meat to breathe, which aids in proper fermentation and aging.\n   \n3. **Dry Aging and Maturation:**\n   - **Natural Molds:** These form on the exterior of the salami and play a role in the aging process. Although these molds are resistant to penetration by flies, they do not impede the drying or curing process.\n   - **Moisture Loss and Dehydration:** The casings facilitate a steady moisture loss and gradual dehydration. Cooling air circulates, ensuring that the salami dries gradually until it reaches the ideal state of ripeness: firm, dense, richly flavored, and with just a hint of moisture.\n\nThis description highlights the technological and biological intricacies of producing quality salami, focusing on the balance between exposing the meat to beneficial bacteria and protecting it from harmful external factors."

With its mild, sunny, cool, maritime climate, the island is an up-and-coming wine region, known especially for its pinot noir, as well as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, riesling, and sparkling wines. While most of its 160 wine producers are small, winemaking here has exploded, especially in the past decade. From a mere 100 acres (40 hectares) of vines in the 1950s, Tasmania now has some 3,700 acres (1,500 hectares) of vineyards.\n\nTasmania (or \"Tazzy,\" as it is often called locally) is named for the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who discovered it in 1642. The island’s vast array of plant and animal life includes the Tasmanian devil, a not very devilish, doglike creature, which, like the kangaroo, is a marsupial.\n\n#### WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n- **Regions**:\n  - MARGARET RIVER\n  - GREAT SOUTHERN REGION\n  - PEMBERTON\n  - PERTH HILLS\n  - SWAN VALLEY\n\nFar on the other side of the Australian continent, 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) away from the power centers of winemaking in the southeast, is the remote state of Western Australia. The first known sighting of the western coastline was in 1622, by the Dutch vessel Leeuwin, meaning “lioness.” The name would later be adopted by one of the state’s most prominent wineries.\n\nWestern Australia’s several wine districts, which include Margaret River, Great Southern Region, Pemberton, Perth Hills, and Swan Valley, stretch out from the coastal city of Perth. Vines were planted in this area in 1829, some years before the first plantings in either South Australia or Victoria. But the state’s isolation and limited population hampered the industry’s growth and scope until the 1980s.\n\nThe Swan Valley, north of Perth, was Western Australia’s first wine district. It became known for table grapes as well as wine grapes, and the leading wines were mostly sweet and/or fortified, and were sold in bulk. It was here that Houghton White Burgundy, once Australia’s most recognized white wine, was born in the years just before World War II. Although it is slightly more polished now (and renamed Houghton White Classic), it was originally a rustic, powerfully alcoholic wine made from chenin blanc, muscadelle, and chardonnay. Amazingly, the Swan Valley is also where the Portuguese grape verdelho was planted—almost two centuries ago, in 1829. It was brought by one of Western Australia’s first colonists, a botanist named Thomas Waters, who took cuttings from the island of Madeira, off the African coast (a stopping point to pick up provisions on the long voyage out). Among the best verdelhos to try are Ashbrook Estate, Chestnut Grove, and Capel Vale."

The word \"verde\" represents the color 'green' but historically indicated that the wine was to be consumed young.\n- **Production Changes**: The production of vinho verde did not always account for bottle aging, which has changed over time due to improved wine quality.\n- **Grape Varieties**: It can be made from any of 25 white grape varieties, including alvarinho, trajadura, and loureiro.\n- **Noteworthy Regions and Producers**: Notable regions include Rías Baixas in Spain. Quinta das Arcas and Anselmo Mendes are highlighted as significant producers.\n\n#### Historical Fact Sidebar: YO, NEW YORKAS... WHO’S THE QUEEN IN QUEENS?\n- **Content**: The borough of Queens in New York City was named after Queen Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II of England, tying the name to the era when New Amsterdam became New York.\n\n#### Attributes of Vinho Verde\n- **Color Variants**: While primarily white, vinho verde is also available in red hues, which are not typical for export but can be found locally.\n- **Taste Profile**: Red vinho verde can range from fascinating to very acidic, a characteristic appreciated for pairing with local cuisine such as bean, pork, and codfish dishes.\n\n#### Market Position\n- **Comparison**: Vinho verde represents just one of the Denominações de Origem Controladas (DOCs) in Minho, with many other avant-garde whites being produced that do not qualify as vinho verde.\n- **Examples**: Quinta de Covela produces a notable dry white wine blend including avesso, chardonnay, viognier, and gewürztraminer.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- **Summary**: The Minho is pivotal in the Portuguese wine industry, particularly for its production of the diverse and evolving vinho verde, alongside a spectrum of other unique white wines."

Although wine can be happily drunk from just about anything, from Mason jars to Baccarat crystal, most wine drinkers would agree that a good wineglass can heighten the pleasure of wine drinking and actually enhance the aroma and flavor of wines. This is not just psychological. A well-designed glass allows the wine’s aromas and flavors to evolve. Moreover, the wine itself will flow over the rim in a direct stream that focuses it on the palate.\n\n## How do you go about buying good wineglasses when there are dozens of glass manufacturers to choose from, and prices for wineglasses can range from five to a hundred dollars a glass? Here are some guidelines:\n\n- **Buy only wineglasses you can afford to break.** If spending fifty dollars per glass means you’d never use them, buy less expensive ones.\n\n- **Buy more glasses than you think you’ll need.** Glasses break. And besides, there may be times when you want to serve two different wines side by side for comparison.\n\n- **Never buy small glasses.** Drinking wine out of a small glass feels as awkward as sitting on a too-small chair or eating dinner off a bread plate.\n\n- **Consider buying one great glass to use for both red and white wines.** A well-designed, good wineglass—whether it will eventually hold red or white wine—should have a generous bowl. An ample bowl gives the wine’s aromas and flavors room in which to evolve. Closer to the rim, however, the bowl should narrow, forcing the aromas to be focused toward your nose.\n\n- **Buy glasses that are absolutely clear and smooth,** not faceted, to show off the depth and richness of the wine’s color. Colored and/or cut glass may be beautiful, but you cannot see the wine.\n\n- **Make sure the glass has a thin rim,** so that the wine glides over it easily, and so that you don’t feel like you have to chew on the glass to get to the wine.\n\n- **Choose a glass with a stem,** to give you something to hold other than the bowl. Holding the glass around the bowl can warm the wine. And besides, without a stem, it’s almost impossible to swirl the wine in the glass.\n\n- **In addition to regular wineglasses, buy tulips/flutes** for serving Champagne and sparkling wines. The slightly tapered shape of a tulip/flute encourages a steady stream of bubbles, and with these wines, bubbles are part of the pleasure."

Spread them on a baking sheet and break them into smaller clumps. Expose to bright sunlight until they dry sufficiently to crumble easily into individual beans.\n4. **Appearance of Dried Beans:** As the beans further dry, they are separable into individual pieces resembling raisins.\n\nThis method emphasizes slow fermentation and careful handling to ensure the beans develop the desired flavor and texture, with periodic sampling to gauge readiness."
