    "contenu": "The document focuses on a recipe or preparation method of a dish called \"Sour Rye Porridge Soup (Zur)\" which is a part of Polish cuisine. It emphasizes the use of sourdough, traditionally used beyond bread and pancakes, specifically highlighting its application in this soup. The base of the soup is made from a ferment called \"zur,\" which is prepared similarly to a thin rye porridge. This fermenting process uses a clay pot that is typically not cleaned between uses to facilitate fermentation.\n\nThe document also explains the cultural significance and the broader use of fermented rye in Slavic cuisine. It links \"zur\" to a few related foods and drinks:\n1. **Kisiel**: A dish similar to zur but with a higher flour content.\n2. **Kvass**: A traditional Slavic beverage made from rye bread.\n3. **Zakwas**: A rye sourdough from which zur is directly made. \n\nIt gives a brief preparation guide suggesting to let the sourdough starter ferment for a couple of days until it sours adequately, with an optional addition of garlic to enhance the sourdough's flavor. The document notes that for adequate zur you would need about 2 cups (approximately 500 ml) of rye sourdough starter.\n\nIt also references ethnographer Anna Kowalska-Lewicka, highlighting her notes on traditional practices involved in making zur in every urban or village household in Poland. Additionally, the document mentions a chapter dedicated to this subject, referred to as \"chapter 6\". \n\nThis text likely comes from a larger work focusing on culinary practices, especially those involving traditional or fermented ingredients."

It is divided into two main sections:\n\n1. **The Importance of Recipe Layout and Preparation:**\n   - It notes that the layout of recipes in this document is distinct from typical recipes found in a Sunday newspaper which usually present all ingredients in one list followed by preparation steps.\n   - This variation has a purpose: the document aims toward an efficient approach where parts of the recipe such as sauces, main ingredients, and toppings are prepared in sequence to ensure smooth assembly of the final dish.\n   - Emphasizing the concept of \"mise en place\" (a French culinary phrase which means \"everything in its place\"), it highlights the necessity of preparation and organization in cooking.\n   - An example provided compares a potentially chaotic scenario of cooking (like a scene from the TV show *I Love Lucy*) to a more orderly method that avoids confusion and interruptions.\n\n2. **The Golden Thread:**\n   - This section draws an analogy between composing a meal and crafting a short story or a novel, suggesting each part of the meal (like courses in a meal) should progress logically with a beginning, middle, and end.\n   - The document critiques meals that lack \"taste logic\", where the sequence of dishes doesn't make sense or feels disjointed.\n   - It supports the importance of transitions between dishes and the progression from one taste to another.\n   - The text encourages creative and thoughtful meal planning likened to an artistic performance, stressing the importance of impressions made by the start and end of a meal.\n   - A practical example mentions a summer supper beginning with a specific recipe from page 130, suggesting a strategic beginning to arouse the palate.\n\nOverall, the document promotes thoughtful and strategic cooking and meal planning to enhance both the ease of cooking and the dining experience. It underscores the importance of preparation, logical sequence, and the artistic element of creating a meal."

Here’s a structured summary and key points:\n\n### Tempeh Preparation Techniques:\n1. **Temperature and Time for Fermentation**\n   - Acidic fermentation to lower the pH of soybeans to 4.5 takes much longer at lower temperatures (68°F/20°C for 36 hours) compared to higher temperatures (98.6°F/37°C).\n\n2. **Acidification Method**\n   - Western approaches commonly substitute vinegar for traditional pre-fermentation methods.\n   - William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi, authors of *The Book of Tempeh*, suggest adding 1½ tablespoons of vinegar per 10 cups of water during cooking as a modern adaptation.\n   - *The Farm*’s tempeh recipe recommends adding vinegar directly to cooked beans — 2 tablespoons of vinegar per pound of dry soybeans — and skipping the soaking step.\n\n3. **Recollections and Experiments by Betty Stechmeyer**\n   - Betty Stechmeyer, co-founder of GEM Cultures, originally included vinegar in the tempeh making process as per *The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook* which recommends adding vinegar to cooked beans before inoculation.\n   - She recalls an incident where she accidentally omitted vinegar and found no noticeable difference in the quality of the tempeh, concluding that the method was still effective without vinegar.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **Historical notes**: The experimentation dates back about 30 years when initial guidelines for tempeh making were established.\n- **Practical Advice**: If using vinegar in the preparation, it should be well distributed before adding the tempeh starter.\n\nAdditionally, the document includes an illustration of soybeans, indicating the primary ingredient discussed in the text."

Barolo and Barbaresco—two of the country’s most legendary and serious reds—are born here. (So is the world’s least serious sparkling wine, the playful spumante known as Asti.)\n\nIf Italy is sometimes thought of as the cradle of Bacchanalian frivolity, you’d never know it in Piedmont. Winemakers here are prudent and diligent about their work. Shake a Piedmontese vintner’s hand, and it’s the rough, heavy, calloused hand of someone who has worked forever in a vineyard. The winemaking style in Piedmont (as well as the culinary traditions of the region) has strong links to that of their closest neighbor, France. Indeed, if Piedmont has an enological soul mate, it is not Tuscany, as one might expect, but France’s Burgundy. In both regions, wine estates are meticulously cared for and mostly small (the average vineyard estate in Piedmont is 3 to 5 acres/1.2 to 2 hectares). The wine traditions of both were firmly molded by centuries of monastic (Benedictine) rule. Most important of all, Piedmont and Burgundy share the philosophic belief that great wine is the progeny of a single, perfectly adapted grape variety (nebbiolo in Piedmont; pinot noir in Burgundy). This is in complete opposition to most of the rest of Italy, and indeed most of France, where wines tend to be made from a blend of grapes.\n\nIt’s difficult to describe just how esteemed Piedmont’s leading wines Barolo and Barbaresco are, not just in Piedmont, but in Italy as a whole. At their best, these wines are supremely complex and riveting. But Barolo and Barbaresco are also lauded because nebbiolo, one of the world’s most site-specific grape varieties, is, in terms of viticulture and winemaking, one of the most difficult to master. Indeed only 8 percent of all plantings in Piedmont are nebbiolo. Yet no place in the world has more nebbiolo than this one place, and no place in the world has had more success with this complicated, demanding, challenging grape."

    "contenu": "# THE TWELVE APOSTLES, A DOZEN EGGS, AND... THE TWELVE-BOTTLE CASE\n\nOne could make a case against cases. Why are the damn things so heavy? Why, for that matter, do they contain twelve bottles? When it comes to the latter, surprisingly, no one seems to know. The leading theory is that twelve bottles of wine (weighing 30 to 35 pounds/13 to 15 kilograms) is the upper limit of what most people can lift and carry at one time. The configuration of three bottles by four bottles renders the nearly-square case stable and therefore easy to stack in a warehouse or store. Stable stacking is much harder, for example, when the case is configured six bottles by two bottles, though admittedly a minority of cases are constructed this way. While it's not clear when wine began to be shipped in case boxes, various types of goods have been packaged in multiples of six for as long as wine has been bottled (which is slightly more than three centuries). Indeed, a dozen is thought to be one of the most primitive groupings, perhaps because there are a dozen cycles of the moon, and a dozen months in a year. A dozen is also easily split up as ½, ¼, ⅛, ⅙, and ¹⁄₁₂. The Romans, in fact, first used twelve as a way of subdividing their money. No matter how deeply embedded a dozen is in Western culture, however, the twelve-bottle wine case may soon be a memory. Already several European countries, including France, have banned twelve-bottle cases as being too heavy to lift and therefore potentially injurious to health. The French now package and buy their wine in tidy boxes of six bottles. And thus, no longer does un six-pack, s'il vous plaît just mean beer.\n\n## PUT PRICE IN PERSPECTIVE\nA bottle of wine serves five. So that $25 wine is, per serving, about what many people spend without a second thought on, say, a latte. In addition, there are many very good, inexpensive wines — you just have to taste more widely to find them. Wine professionals themselves often buy very reasonably priced wines for every-night drinking.\n\n## THAT SAID, DON’T BE AFRAID TO TREAT YOURSELF\nThere are extraordinary wine experiences to be had, and you should have them! Occasionally springing for a special, expensive bottle enriches your wine knowledge and can be very satisfying.\n\n## SET ASIDE A MODEST BUDGET FOR NEW WINE EXPERIENCES\nThen, once every week or two, spend that money on a wine you’ve never had before. Remember: The best way to learn nothing about wine is to continue to drink what you already know you like.\n\n## THINK OF WINE AS A WAY TO TRAVEL\nYou may not be able to get to Tuscany or the south of France next summer, but you can certainly have a lot of fun experimenting with Tuscan or southern French wines anyway. Again, it doesn’t matter where you begin. If you’re fascinated by Australia, start there. If you’ve never tried a wine from Argentina, try one now.\n\n## BE ENDLESSLY CURIOUS\nYou’re not the only one who doesn’t know what’s inside all those bottles. Most people don’t. The wine drinkers who have the most fun and learn the most are those who have the courage to be curious.\n\n## FINALLY, USE FOOD AS A LANGUAGE\nIf you’re trying to describe to the wine shop staff the kinds of wines you like and you’re at a loss for words, think about foods. Wines can be big and juicy like a steak; fresh and light like a salad; or spicy and bold like a Thai soup. It isn’t necessary to use technical wine terms. One day, wanting an adventure, I asked a salesperson to give me a wine like the late comedian Robin Williams. Amazingly enough, and without a minute’s hesitation, he did just that."

It is often used in Persian cooking, notably to provide tart notes to a dish called jeweled rice.\n\n## Other Temperate Fruits\n\n### Ground Cherry\nGround Cherry is referred to as either **Cape ground cherry** or **gooseberry** (Physalis peruviana), or **tomatillo** from North and South America. These fruits are characterized by their resemblance to miniature, thick-skinned yellowish tomatoes, encased in papery husks. They are known for their room temperature preservation and have floral and caramel aroma notes, commonly used in preserves and pies.\n\n### Persimmon\nThe persimmons fall under the genus **Diospyros**, prevalent in both Asia and North America. Significant types of persimmons include:\n- **American persimmon (D. virginiana)**: Native to U.S., recognizable by its plum size.\n- **Mexican species black sapote (D. digyna)**\n- **D. kaki**: This species is widely grown, similar in appearance to apples and adopted primarily in Japan.\n\nPersimmons are known for their ability to be consumed raw or processed into desserts like puddings. Steps like wrapping the fruit in airtight plastic or using other methods help in removing the astringency by preventing the tannins in the fruit from binding to proteins during cooking.\n\n## Historical Insight\n\n### Rhubarb\nThe name \"rhubarb\" originates from the medieval Latin words **rha** (pertaining to the Volga River) and **barbarum**, indicating it as a foreign plant from the areas east of the Volga River.\n\n---"

It's well-structured, with clear instructions for the cheese-making process, and includes images to guide the reader visually through different steps. Here's a structured breakdown of the recipe based on the content from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Faire un caillé frais et un paneer ★★\n\n#### Overview\n- **Temps de repos:** 6 heures\n\n#### Ingredients\n- 1 litre de lait frais entier\n- 1 cuillère à soupe de jus de citron\n- ¼ cuillère à soupe de vinaigre cristal\n\n#### Instructions\n1. **Heat the Milk:**  \n   Portez à ébullition le lait. Versez le jus de citron ou le vinaigre dans le lait chaud, hors du feu. Laissez reposer 10 minutes : le caillé se forme et s'urnage dans le petit lait. \n\n2. **Strain the Curdled Milk:**  \n   Égouttez ce caillé dans une passoire recouverte d'une étamine fine. Vous pouvez utiliser aussi un sac à lait. Laissez s'égoutter 10 minutes dans la passoire (4). Vous avez ensuite à prélever le caillé obtenu, puis le placer au réfrigérateur 2 heures avant de le démouler nature ou avec du miel, des fines herbes...\n\n3. **Press the Cheese:**  \n   Pour réaliser ce paneer, pressez fortement le caillé obtenu afin d'éliminer le maximum de petit-lait (5). Tout en maintenant le caillé dans l'étamine, pressez-le 6 heures entre deux planches, sinon servez-le avec un poids par-dessus (boîtes de conserve, pots...) (6).\n\n4. **Finishing Touches:**  \n   Déballez délicatement de l'étamine et coupez en cubes à utiliser selon la recette (7).\n\n5. **Storage:**  \n   Si vous ne l'utilisez pas immédiatement après fabrication, placez-le dans un récipient hermétique rempli d'eau froide. Conservez-le 2 jours maximum au réfrigérateur.\n\n#### Tips from the Chef\n- **Le conseil du chef:** Utilisez du lait frais plutôt que du lait UHT: il sera plus goûteux et le caillé se tiendra bien mieux.\n- **Pan Storage:** Le paneer doit être conservé dans l'eau et se conserve peu: ajouter ¼ de cuillère à café de sel dans le lait permet d'améliorer sa conservation.\n- **Utilization Tips:** Ne jetez pas le petit-lait utilisé: le dans vos soupes, smoothies et pour la cuisson des légumineuses, qu'il contribue à attendrir.\n\n#### Additional Information\n- **Bon à savoir:** Vous obtiendrez environ 250 g de fromage frais et 180 à 200 g de paneer avec 1 litre de lait.\n- **Cheese Freshness:** Le fromage frais maison se conserve 4 à 5 jours dans une boîte hermétique.\n\n#### Recipe Ideas\n- **Pages with Recipes:** Poovers et fromage frais aux herbes, p. 367; Palak paneer, p. 360\n\n---\n\nThis recipe layout is informative, not only providing steps for making fresh cheese and paneer but also offering useful tips for enhancing taste, extending shelf-life, and using by-products efficiently."

    "contenu": "### MÂCONNAIS\n\n---\n\n**Region Overview**\nSouth of the Cote Chalonnaise lies the Mâconnais, a large region characterized by low-lying hills, woodlands, farmland, and meadows. The soil composition in this region varies, with limestone and marl found in some areas, while granite and schist are present in others. The region is notable for producing wines chiefly from chardonnay grapes, with the top three appellations being Mâcon, Pouilly-Fuissé, and St.-Véran.\n\n**Appellations and Varieties**\n1. **Mâcon**: Primarily simple Mâcon (about 80% of production, mostly from cooperatives) and Mâcon-Villages. Special villages like Mâcon-Lugny, Mâcon-Viré, and Mâcon-Fuissé can append their names to Mâcon for distinction.\n   \n2. **Pouilly-Fuissé**: Highly regarded within the Mâconnais for its high-quality limestone soils, originating from the four hamlets of Vergisson, Solutré-Pouilly, Fuissé, and Chaintré. Note not to confuse Pouilly-Fuissé with Pouilly-Fumé, which is a sauvignon blanc from France’s Loire Valley.\n\n3. **St.-Véran**: A relatively less expensive option compared to Pouilly-Fuissé, minus the 'd' in its name.\n\n**Quality and Pricing**\nWhile Pouilly-Fuissé is highly valued, the top productions are particularly noteworthy, though more affordable than the premier offerings from the Côte d'Or. They are bold and dense, albeit not as refined. St.-Véran on the other hand, often offers comparative quality to Pouilly-Fuissé at a lower cost.\n\n---\n\n### Some of the Best Producers of the Mâconnais:\n- Château Fuissé\n- Daniel Barraud\n- de Bongran\n- des Comtes Lafon\n- Guffens-Heynen\n- J. A. Ferret\n- Joseph Drouhin\n- Louis Jadot\n- Robert Denogent\n- Roger Lassarat\n- Valette\n\n---\n\n### Where's the Boeuf?\n**Burgundy's Famous Dish**: Burgundy is renowned for its Boeuf Bourguignon, a traditional dish made with local Charolais beef, pearl onions, mushrooms, bits of fried bacon, and a whole bottle of Burgundy wine. The stew, emblematic of the region’s culinary heritage, is generally prepared with a basic Burgundy wine, reflecting the thriftiness for which Burgundian cooks are known. The stew is rich enough so that there is no need to use premier or grand cru wines in its making, preserving the high-quality wines for direct enjoyment."

Here's a structured summary of the content:\n\n1. **Historical Background and Cultural Context:**\n   - Sorghum beer brewing emerged from gift exchange and reciprocity practices.\n   - It spread through trade routes and developed as a cottage industry.\n\n2. **Economic Impact:**\n   - In Southern Africa, particularly in Botswana, women initially brewed sorghum beer to provide for men who migrated to urban areas for work. This is highlighted by economist Steven J. Hagblade in his doctoral dissertation.\n   - A 1972 report from the International Labour Office suggests that home-scale brewing may have been a significant source of employment, especially for single women in some African countries.\n   - The Botswana government in the 1970s recognized brewing as the most widespread manufacturing activity and a critical economic component in rural areas. Women who brewed beer were referred to as \"Shebeen Queens,\" operating from their homes known as shebeens.\n\n3. **Development of the Industry:**\n   - The first commercial sorghum beer factories in Southern Africa emerged in the early 1900s.\n   - Sorghum brewing became the first modern manufacturing industry in Botswana.\n   - The South African government in the late 1930s banned homemade sorghum beer in urban areas and mandated municipal governments to supply officially brewed sorghum beer, leading to the growth of commercial brewing.\n\n4. **Modern Context:**\n   - Currently, the most popular brand of sorghum beer in southern Africa is Chibuku, sold in waxed cartons similar to how milk is packaged.\n   - Chibuku is also known as Shake Shake because shaking it helps mix its liquid and solid parts. The BBC describes it as having a grainy, yoghurt-like consistency with a zesty effervescence similar to Lambrusco.\n\nThis overview covers the transformation of sorghum beer brewing from a small-scale home activity to a significant commercial industry, highlighting its role in the socio-economic context of Southern Africa, especially Botswana."

    "contenu": "### Analysis of the Document\n\nThe document discusses the use of fermented human urine as a nutrient and fertilizer in both aquaponic and soil gardening systems. \n\n#### Key Points:\n\n1. **Experimental Usage**: The text begins by discussing an aquaponic gardener who tests the safety of using human urine as fertilizer by fermenting it until the pH rises to 9. Upon testing, while fresh urine samples were positive for fecal coliforms, the fermented urine tested negative. This led him to conclude that using aged urine in his gardening system shouldn't pose health risks.\n\n2. **Aging Urine as a Fertilizer**:\n   - The text describes how aging urine (fermenting it) has been a strategy used by gardeners to enrich soil with nitrogen—a vital nutrient for plants.\n   - It mentions a specific individual, Hector Black, who uses his own aged urine, diluted with water, to fertilize his orchard and garden. He notes particular benefits on nitrogen-loving plants like greens and corn.\n\n3. **Adoption in Uganda**:\n   - The practice of using fermented urine is also noted to be spreading in Uganda, where a farmer named Mary Batwaweela implements this technique. In her practice, each family member contributes nightly to a collective container that is later fermented and used on crops.\n\n4. **Global Practices**:\n   - The document briefly references that similar practices have been documented online from various global locations including China and India, indicating a broader acceptance or exploration of this technique in different cultures.\n\nThis section concludes before transitioning to a discussion on feeding animals with fermentation, suggesting a broader theme of utilizing fermentation in sustainable practices.\n\n### Structured Content\n```markdown\n| Subject                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Aquaponic Use          | Experiments using human urine as fertilizer in aquaponic systems.

    "contenu": "The document outlines differences in winemaking processes and characteristics for red and white wines, focusing on how color, flavor, and style are affected by the use of grape skins. Here's the structured breakdown:\n\n### Red Wines\n- **Skin-Driven**: Red wines are described as \"skin-driven\" because they derive their color, flavor, and style largely from grape skins. Dark-skinned grapes are used, and the skins are soaked during winemaking to release more compounds, antioxidants, and vitamins as compared to the juicy pulp. This process generally results in stronger and more acidic wines.\n- **Fermentation**: The fermentation process for red wines involves contact with grape skins to transfer color and flavors effectively. This is best done quickly and at warm temperatures (typically between 65°F to 85°F or 18°C to 30°C). Heat helps in extracting color and flavor while managing not to \"cook\" the grape compounds, hence enhancing the natural characteristics of the grapes.\n\n### White Wines\n- **Juice-Driven**: In contrast to red wines, white wines are \"juice-driven.\" They are made without the grape skins, leading to simpler and milder flavors that showcase the qualities of fresh juice or peeled fruit.\n- **Fermentation**: White wines are fermented with juice alone to maintain freshness and acidity, which is optimally done slowly at colder temperatures (typically between 45°F to 65°F or 7°C to 18°C). This process focuses on retaining as much of the fresh fruit character as possible, with a careful balance between temperature and fermentation speed.\n\nEach wine's unique aspects stem from how the grape components are handled before and during fermentation, impacting the final flavor profile and sensory experience."

    "contenu": "```markdown\n# MAGIC INGREDIENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS\n\n## GARLIC AND ONIONS (SLOW-COOKED)\n- Add creaminess and roundness to a dish. When braised, roasted, or sweated, they add sweetness. When caramelized, they add sweetness and smoky flavors.\n- \"Pop\" red or white wines with ripe fruit and/or slight sweetness.\n- Meld nicely with oak-aged and oak-influenced wines.\n- Help form a bridge between foods and wines with more weight and texture.\n- Provide a link to earthier wines, such as classically styled European wines (true of raw and quickly sautéed garlic and onions as well).\n\n## OLIVES\n- Can swing dishes toward pairing with either red or white wines. Green olives create a white wine affinity (especially with Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, and unoaked Chardonnay), and black olives create a red wine affinity (especially with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah).\n- With flavored cures (such as those incorporating peppers and herbs) can lend another dimension of compatibility to a dish. Strong cures (especially those very high in acid or vinegar) are best rinsed off.\n\n## CURED MEATS (PROSCIUTTO, BACON, PANCETTA, AND OTHER CHARCUTERIE)\n- Can tilt “white wine” dishes (fish, poultry, veal, pork) toward pairing with red wines. Prosciutto-wrapped fish or shellfish with bacon, for example, can pair beautifully with soft, bright reds and rosés.\n\n## CHEESE AND OTHER DAIRY INGREDIENTS\n- Add texture and richness to a dish when used in cooking.\n- Can be a bridge between salads or vegetables and higher-acid white wines. Try using a small amount of goat cheese, feta, or gorgonzola.\n\n## HERBS (FRESH OR DRIED)\n- That are fragrant (chervil, dill, tarragon) pair best with whites like Riesling and Chardonnay.\n- That are more pungent (basil, thyme, rosemary) go best with Sauvignon Blanc and many reds (especially Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon).\n\n## LENTILS, BEANS, AND OTHER LEGUMES\n- Can pair beautifully with white wines.\n- If prepared with herbs, can swing a dish toward white wine; if prepared with meat (bacon, ham, pancetta, sausage), can swing a dish toward red wine.\n- Can provide a clean backdrop for fuller-bodied white wines. Waxy white beans are a good example.\n- Can enable fish to pair with red as well as white wines. Try serving fish over a bed of green lentils.\n\n## MUSHROOMS\n- Add earthiness and a natural affinity for earthy wines.\n- That are darker (especially reconstituted dried mushrooms) make almost all foods red wine friendly.\n- That are light-colored, creamy, and textured (shiitake, chanterelles, oyster, button) help dishes go well with white wines, especially those with texture (Chardonnay, oak-aged Sauvignon Blanc, and Pinot Gris).\n\n## NUTS\n- When toasted and added to a dish (as a crust on a piece of fish, for example) pick up on the nutty nuances imparted by oak-barrel-aged wines and show off oak-aged wines.\n- With the skin on (especially walnuts and almonds) have an inherent bitterness that softens the perception of bitter tannins in red wines and some strongly oak-aged whites.\n- That are powdered and used in cooking (as in moles and other Latino and world foods) make dishes wine-friendly and can favor lightly oak-aged wines.\n```"

    "contenu": "### Oignon\n\nDans la cuisine, c'est le plus bosseur. Parmi les espèces qui composent le genre *Allium*, l'oignon contribue à une gamme de saveurs distinctes, depuis la lumineuse fraîcheur de la ciboulette jusqu'au parfum délicat de l'échalote, en passant par le tapageur oignon en bulbe, tireur de larmes, et le poireau aux saveurs de terre teintées de verdure qu’il partage avec la ciboule, dite aussi oignon de printemps, cive, chiboule ou ail fistuleux. Cru, l'oignon donne un côté tranchant et croustillant aux sauces et aux salades ; rôti ou braisé, il devient doux et succulent ; frit jusqu’à en avoir les bords carbonisés, il ajoute une dimension aigre-douce à un hot-dog.\n\n#### Oignon & Agneau:\nUne sauce aux oignons est un partenaire classique de l’agneau ou du mouton rôtis. L'auteur gastronomique Charles Campion se souvient que cette association était la valeur sûre sur laquelle sa mère pouvait toujours compter. Principalement, se souvenait-il, à cause de cette sauce si particulière qu’elle préparait avec beaucoup d'oignons : elle les faisait fondre dans du beurre, puis mijoter dans du lait avec de la noix de muscade et du poivre noir, pour ensuite faire épaissir le tout avec de la fécule de pomme de terre et de la crème. Les plats sont moins tolérants que les livres avec ce genre d'habitudes alimentaires peu raffinées. Le penchant qu’a James Bond pour le kebab agneau-oignon est en cela une omission notable dans le film adapté du livre *Bons baisers de Russie* : pendant que son contact turc, Darko, s'attaque à ce qui semble être du kibbeh (de l'agneau émincé cru, finement haché avec de la ciboulette et des poivrons), Bond choisit plutôt de l’agneau grillé au feu de bois, avec du riz aux légumes et beaucoup d'oignons. Pas étonnant qu'il ne se lance pas dans une scène d'action après ça.\n\n#### Oignon & Ail: \n- voir Ail & Oignon.\n\n#### Oignon & Anchois:\nUn jour de pluie à Venise, nous étions en quête avec des amis d'un lieu pour déjeuner dans les ruelles du Dorsoduro (un des six *sestieri*, les quartiers historiques de la cité des Doges) et nous avons finalement choisi un café avec une carte minimale où il n’était pas écrit *English spoken*. Le Dorsoduro est un poisson moins touristique que le San Marco, de l'autre côté du Grand Canal, aussi le propriétaire et son épouse semblent-ils très heureux de recevoir quelques *inglesi* dans leur restaurant, comme si l'idée même de visiteurs étrangers était, à Venise, une nouveauté. Nous avons voulu essayer la spécialité locale, les *bigoli* aux anchois et aux oignons. Un plat si énorme qu'un gondolier aurait pu le piloter est arrivé sur la table, accompagné de plusieurs carafes de soave (DOC, vin blanc de Vénétie). Les *bigoli*, ressemblant, en plus épais, à des spaghettis de blé entier, avec un goût de fruits à coque, un caractère rugueux, et ils constituent un support idéal pour le mélange sucré-salé d'oignons et d’anchois. Si vous ne pouvez pas vous en procurer, utilisez des spaghettis de blé entier. Pour 2 à 3 personnes, faites fondre à feu moyen pendant 10 minutes 3 oignons finement émincés dans 2 ou 3 cuillerées à soupe d’huile d’olive, mais sans les laisser se colorer. Ajoutez 4 ou 5 anchois salés, que vous briserez en mélangeant, et assaisonnez en gardant à l’esprit que l’anchois est déjà très salé à la base. Poursuivez la cuisson durant 10 minutes. Faites cuire les pâtes jusqu’à ce qu'elles soient al dente. Égouttez-les, en réservant 1 cuillerée à soupe d'eau, et remettez-les dans la casserole. Placez sur le feu et incorporez la sauce. Pour une touche de douceur, ajoutez 1 cuillerée à soupe de raisins de Corinthe aux oignons. Vous pouvez essayer dans cette recette quelques-unes des autres associations possibles avec les anchois : un peu de romarin, quelques brocolis blanchis et hachés, et peut-être une petite poignée de câpres.\n\n#### Oignon & Betterave:\nLa douceur de la betterave est grandement compensée par l'oignon cru. Lorsqu’il est cuit, l'oignon prend un goût sucré qui lui est propre, équilibré par le vinaigre dans cette recette de chutney à la betterave et aux oignons que vous pourrez servir avec des frinds à la saucisse ou dans des sandwiches au fromage. Faites mijoter dans 30 ml de vinaigre de vin rouge 700 g d'oignons coupés en dés avec 450 g de pommes à croquer pelées, évidées et coupées en dés, jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient tendres – cela prend environ 20 minutes. Ajoutez 700 g de cubes de betteraves cuites, 250 ml de vinaigre supplémentaire, 400 g de sucre, 1 cuillerée à café de sel et 2 cuillerées à café de piment en grains."

The document highlights that the highest quality, \"Prime\" grade, was reserved for young, finely-textured meat with abundant marbling. The predominant breeds mentioned are purebred Angus and Hereford beef.\n- Market changes led to the allowance of leaner meat to qualify for Prime and Choice grades due to consumer preference for lower-fat beef.\n\n**U.S. Beef Quality and Grades Today:**\n- Despite the traditional prestige of Prime beef, it’s acknowledged that marbling should account for no more than a third of the variation in the overall tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of cooked beef. Factors like breed, exercise and feed, age, slaughter conditions, and storage conditions are significant.\n- Beef grading now allows for the reclassification based on age, with potential recognition for darker-colored meat from older animals as flavorful due to more muscle fibers.\n- Most graded supermarket beef today is classified as \"Choice\", with a fat content of around 10%-13%. \"Select\" is slightly leaner, with 2%-4% fat. Ground beef, which can be either all lean meat or a mixture of lean and fat, varies from 5% to 30% fat content.\n\nThis summary captures the critical points presented in the document concerning meat classification and the factors influencing the quality and categories of beef in the United States market."
