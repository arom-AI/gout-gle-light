This helps prevent the formation of a coarse texture due to overheated protein.\n\n2. **Heating Technique:**\n   - The milk should be heated slowly and gently, with frequent stirring to avoid scalding. \n\n3. **Temperature Thresholds for Different Yogurt Textures:**\n   - Although it’s possible to make yogurt by heating the milk only up to 115°F/46°C (which avoids overheating), the resulting yogurt will not be as thick as that made from milk heated to higher temperatures.\n\n4. **Purpose of Heating:**\n   - The purpose of heating milk for yogurt is more than just sterilizing to kill native bacteria. It also helps modify the milk's protein, casein, to form a thick, firm yogurt texture.\n\n5. **Process of Concentration:**\n   - Maintaining milk at high temperatures with constant stirring leads to evaporation and concentration of the milk, which makes the yogurt thicker.\n  \n6. **Commercial Practices:**\n   - Many yogurt manufacturers and home producers might add powdered milk or other thickening additives to simulate the traditional thickening process that occurs through evaporation during prolonged heating.\n\n7. **Reference to Cooking Literature:**\n   - Rosanna Nafziger, co-author of \"Lost Art of Real Cooking,\" is quoted to caution against overheating milk as it affects the texture of the yogurt.\n\n---\n**Recommendations:**\n- For individuals aiming to produce thick yogurt, following the precise heating guidelines will provide the best results. Encouraging thorough stirring and maintaining the right temperature are key factors emphasized for producing quality homemade yogurt."

It is notably one of the longest-living white wines, capable of maturing over years and retains surprising freshness and high levels of acidity. Matured Rieslings are known to develop honey and toast aromas, often described as petrol-like.\n\n**Geographical Distribution and Styles:**\n- **Germany:** Most Rieslings here range from dry to sweet, involving botrytised grapes, maintaining a good balance with high acidity.\n- **Europe (Alsace, Austria):** While both regions produce premium Rieslings, Alsace specializes in dry wines but also offers sweet late-harvest and botrytis wines.\n- **Australia (Clare and Eden Valleys):** Known for refreshing acidity and displaying aromas of lime and bone dryness. Particularly noted for fruity, old-style wines and can contain tropical fruit and honey flavors in wines from the Lakes AVA of New York State, USA.\n\n**Winemaking Choices:**\n- Handling aromatic grape varieties requires careful monitoring to retain fruit and floral aromas. Processes involved include monitoring SO2 levels, use of inert vessels (to avoid flavor extraction from vessels), and choosing appropriate yeast that complements the primary fruit aromas, which may vary depending on the wine-making style.\n- Typically, inert vessels (e.g., stainless steel) are preferred for preserving the pure character of fruits. The integration of oak vessels can induce a slight oxidation and texture enhancement, alongside controlled fermentation to provide stability without overpowering with oak aromas.\n- **Sauvignon Blanc:** Generally fermented until dry.\n- **Riesling:** Offers flexibility in winemaking, from dry to sweet styles.\n\nThe document also includes imagery to show the condition and appearance of grapes used in different winemaking practices (botrytised and frozen).\n\n**Images Commentary:**\n- **Botrytis cinerea:** Displayed on grapes as a clear sign, crucial for certain sweet wine processes.\n- **Passerillage:** A method shown where grapes naturally shrivel but remain fungus-free, enhancing concentration.\n- **Frozen Grapes:** Kept on the vine through winter, these are essential for ice wine production, capturing intense sweet and acidic profiles due to natural freezing and thawing of the grapes."

It discusses the biochemical properties and behaviors of milk proteins known as casein micelles and whey proteins during processes like curdling and cooking. Below is a structured breakdown of the key content covered in the document:\n\n---\n\n### MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\n#### Casein Micelles and Curdling\n- Casein micelles in milk have a capping-casien molecule that extends into the surrounding liquid, providing them with a negative electrical charge that prevents micelles from clumping together.\n- Curdling can be initiated in several ways including lowering the pH (souring). Normal milk pH is around 6.5, and curdling starts at approximately pH 5.5 when the negative charge of capping-casien is neutralized.\n- At pH 4.7, casein proteins scatter and lose their negative charge, allowing them to re-bond and form a continuous network, resulting in solidification typical in processes like making yogurt or sour cream.\n  \n#### The Whey Proteins\n- Whey proteins differ from casein by their role and composition, mainly providing amino acids, nutrients, and include defensive proteins.\n- Lactoglobulin is the predominant whey protein, unfolding at high temperatures (around 172°F/78°C), which plays a crucial role in creating the flavor characteristic of cooked milk.\n- Lactoglobulin binds to capping-casein in boiling milk, further altering milk protein interactions.\n\n#### Additional Note\n- The document includes an illustration described as \"A model of the milk protein casein,\" which details how individual protein molecules are held together by particles of calcium phosphate.\n\nThis excerpt explains fundamental dairy science concepts essential for understanding how different processes like aging, souring, and cooking affect the structural and sensory properties of milk-based products."

    "contenu": "The document describes the processes of thickening and thinning sauces through the interaction of heat and starch granules. It is structured into two main sections, each focusing on different aspects of how starch behaves in sauces when cooked. Below is a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### Water-Starch Interaction\n- Initially, starch granules absorb a limited amount of water, about 30% of their own weight.\n- With sufficient heat, they sink to the bottom of the pot, swell up, and stress the weaker regions of the granule.\n- At the gelation range (120-140°F or 50-60°C), the granules lose their structured form, absorb water, and form a network of intermingled starch and water molecules.\n- This results in a suspension that becomes more translucent and less cloudy.\n\n### Thickening: The Granules Leak Starch\n- Thickening starts when starch-water mixtures, usually less concentrated (e.g., less than 5% starch by weight), begin to gel as they heat.\n- During gelation, the starch granules become amorphous, leaking amylose and amylopectin into the surrounding liquid.\n- This creates a structure resembling a three-dimensional fishnet filled with water that blocks starch particles' movement but allows some light reflection, making the sauce visibly thicker and more translucent.\n  \n### Thinning: The Granules Break\n- Thinning occurs once the sauce reaches its peak thickness.\n- Factors promoting thinning include prolonged heating, reaching boiling, and vigorous stirring.\n- These actions result in breaking the swollen and fragile starch granules into very small fragments.\n- Following this breakdown, the sauce consistency gradually decreases as it becomes thinner and less structured.\n\n### Visual Illustration\n- The accompanying images depict uncooked starch granules in liquid, showing little interaction initially.\n- As heat is applied and the temperature increases to the gelation point, the granules absorb more water, swell, and disrupt, thus thickening the sauce.\n- Finally, with continued cooking, starch molecules leak into the liquid, increasing the sauce's thickness to its maximum due to the expanded and intermingled starch networks.\n\nThis structured approach provides a detailed insight into how starches work in cooking, particularly in sauce preparation, emphasizing the changes in physical properties through thermal processes."

    "contenu": "# TOKAJI ALLURE\n\nPerhaps more than any other wine in history, Tokaji has been the wine of the famous, the powerful, the pious, and the noble. Its description as \"the king of wines and the wine of kings\" comes from the early eighteenth century, after Francis II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, gave Tokaji to King Louis XIV of France as a gift, resulting in the wine becoming a regular favorite of the French court at Versailles. Next, Louis XV made it a special gift for Madame de Pompadour. Later, Emperor Franz Josef (who was also king of Hungary) developed a tradition of sending Tokaji Aszú to England's Queen Victoria as a yearly birthday present—one bottle for every month she had lived. On her eighty-first, in 1900, she received 972 bottles (a significant present—and something of a shame, since this was her final birthday). Artists, writers, and musicians loved Tokaji—the wine was a favorite of Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, Haydn, Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich von Schiller, Johann Strauss, and Voltaire. Emperor Peter the Great of Russia and Emperor Napoleon III of France both consumed Tokaji heavily—Napoleon, for example, bought thirty to forty full barrels of Tokaji every year. Needless to say, Tokaji was the near-religious elixir preferred by many popes.\n\nIn addition to these dry wines, Tokaji is also now making late-harvest sweet wines that are not Tokaji Aszú. Late-harvest Tokaji, rather like German _beerenauslese_, is a late-harvest sweet wine that may have been made with the benefit of some botrytized bunches of grapes. But that is different than Tokaji Aszú where, as noted above, a paste is made from entirely botrytized berries, the paste is combined with wine, and then the whole is refermented. Two late-harvest wines to try include Oremus Tokaji Furmint Noble Late Harvest and Château Pajzos Muskotály.\n\nYet another type of wine made in the Tokaj region is _szamorodni_, which means “as it is grown” or “as it comes.” When vineyards are not sufficiently affected by botrytis to produce enough aszú berries to make Tokaji Aszú, a blended wine from Tokaji’s three main grapes is made. The _szamorodni_ may be dry (_száraz_) or slightly sweet (_édes_). Szamorodni must be aged two years in the barrel, and most often barrels are not topped up, so the wine takes on a partially oxidized, intriguing toasted-nut character similar to that of Sherry.\n\n## Some of the Best Producers of Tokaji Aszú\n\n- Alana-Tokaj\n- Château Pajzos\n- Disznókő\n- Dobogó\n- Hétszőlő\n- István Szepsy\n- Oremus\n- Royal Tokaji Wine Company\n\nThis document delves into the historic and cultural significance of Tokaji wine, its variants, and some of the prominent producers."

It cannot effectively cut the fat or texture of rich dishes but can complement foods that are not overly acidic or spicy:\n- Not suitable for salads with creamy dressing.\n- Works well with light sauces (e.g., light tomato sauce with cream).\n- Can pair with marinated fish and more rustic dishes like burgers, grilled sausages, simple quiche, roasted chicken.\n- Incompatible with very rich dishes such as those with rich cream sauce or braised rabbit in mustard cream sauce due to its simplicity and not rich flavor profile.\n\nDolcetto is also highlighted for pairing with both fish and shellfish, recommending sweeter, milder varieties like halibut, and butterfish, and also effectively used with salmon, trout, shrimp, and scallops. Suggestions for enhancing these pairings include:\n- Light tomato usage.\n- Small amounts of meat like pancetta, sausage, or ham.\n- Use of mushrooms or black olives.\n- Dishes with simple sauces, sautéed onions, and reduced red wine are favored accompaniments.\n\n## Pairing Pointers\n\nThe text provides general guidelines on how best to enjoy Dolcetto:\n- Ideal for consumption by itself or as a precursor to a meal.\n- Complements easy, straightforward foods well, such as burgers, roast chicken, or pizza.\n- Suggested as a good match for various types of sandwiches, proposing that it would be a suitable drink option in places like Subway.\n\nThe document emphasizes the versatility and friendly nature of Dolcetto, making it a compelling choice for both casual and slightly more refined dining settings."

Below is a structured outline of the content discussed in the document:\n\n### Making Sauerkraut in an Open Crock\n- **Procedure:**\n  1. Chop and salt vegetables.\n  2. Place the vegetables in a crock.\n  3. Use a plate that fits inside the crock to cover the vegetables.\n  4. Weigh the plate down with a gallon-sized jug of water to keep vegetables submerged.\n  5. Cover the setup with a cloth to keep flies out and secure with a string.\n  \n- **Purpose:** \n  - Keeps vegetables submerged under their juices, protecting them from oxygen.\n  - Allows for air circulation to prevent the buildup of pressure.\n\n### Advantages of Open Crock Fermentation\n- **Accessibility:** The open crock allows for checking the sauerkraut by smell, sight, and taste during its development.\n- **Maintenance Required:**\n  - Access to oxygen can cause aerobic molds and yeasts to form on the surface.\n  - Discolored layers and growths can be scraped off or skimmed, and the sauerkraut beneath is usually still fine.\n\n### Personal Opinions and Observations\n- **Some Prefer Closed Vessels:**\n  - Avoids the need to scrape mold from the surface.\n  - Considered by some as an automatic invitation to unwanted microorganisms and molds.\n\n- **Quote:** Patricia Grunau, a fermentation enthusiast, suggests that using cloth over ferments is risky because it attracts microorganisms not intended to join the process.\n\n- **Trade-Offs:** The document mentions that every vessel comes with its benefits and drawbacks, and highlights that some air-locked crock designs are explored in the section \"Crock Lids.\"\n\nThis structured summary captures the main points and techniques discussed in the document regarding the preparation and maintenance of sauerkraut using an open crock method."

This is particularly advantageous in regions close to the Equator that might otherwise be too hot for ideal vineyard conditions.\n\n2. **Frost**\n   - **Vineyard Location Impact on Frost Risk:**\n     - **Local Feature at Location 1:** In this location, cold air descends and warm air rises. The geographical positioning and the surrounding hills trap cold air, thereby increasing the risk of frost.\n     - **Local Feature at Location 2:** Here, the configuration allows cold air to flow away from the vineyard. This prevents the cold air from settling in the vineyard area, substantially decreasing the potential for frost damage.\n\n3. **Directional Wind Flows**\n   - **Description:** The image shows the flow of air and how it is influenced by the mountainous terrain, impacting temperature and moisture levels, which are key factors in vineyard sustainability and wine production quality.\n\n### Visual Elements\n- The document includes:\n  - A colorful illustration of a mountainous landscape.\n  - Arrows indicating wind flows and temperature dynamics.\n  - A simple compass indicating the orientation of the landscape.\n  - Numbered labels (1, 2, 3) marking specific vineyard locations mentioned in the text.\n\nThis structured approach to explaining the text and illustration helps clarify the environmental factors that influence vineyard climates in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly focusing on altitudinal effects and frost risks."

    "contenu": "### How to Navigate the Grapes\n\nIn selecting the grapes to include in this book, I had an obvious starting point. Space limitations meant that I had to omit many classic wine grapes from *Perfect Pairings*, and this was my chance to discuss them. While they are not universal household names like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay, noble grapes like Tempranillo, Nebbiolo, and Chenin Blanc are well-known, globally important, and often signature varieties in certain countries or regions. Those selections have been augmented by grapes I consider rising stars, such as Grüner Veltliner and Malbec. I’ve made up the balance by picking a few long shots, like Mencía and Assyrtiko.\n\nThese grapes are not the Publix or Safeway superstars, but some of them are far better known in other parts of the world than they are in the United States. For example, significantly more Grenache is planted around the world than Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir combined. And the acreage planted to Trebbiano dwarfs that of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Riesling.\n\nMany of the grapes here are not what I’d call classic beauties. To enjoy them, you have to appreciate their unique attributes and quirks, like a meaty or feral aroma that is not readily masked by alcohol or French oak. The grapes in this book have a more enigmatic, international profile. Instead of Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise, think Juliette Binoche, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Javier Bardem.\n\n#### The Grapes\n\nI introduce each grape by name—with its correct pronunciation—along with other names by which it may be known. I list the types of wine (such as sparkling, red, rosé, or fortified) produced from the grape, and the styles or interpretations that different winemakers may produce (with or without oak, for example). If a grape is usually blended with other varieties, I list them."

    "contenu": "# Cocktail Calculus: The Inner Workings of Recipes\n\nI recently constructed a database of cocktail recipes, including both classics and my own, so I could analyze them for ethanol content, sugar, acidity, and dilution. Each drink category—built, stirred, shaken, blended, and carbonated (which we will discuss later)—has clear, well-defined relationships between the characteristics, regardless of the flavors in a particular recipe. This might seem obvious, but the implications are not. I discovered that given a set of ingredients and a style of drink, I can write a decent recipe without tasting along the way at all. I have tested this process dozens of times, and I am shocked at how close I can get to the desired result strictly through applying the math. Bitterness is a bit of a wild card—very hard to quantify. Thank God something is.\n\nI’m not talking about swapping rum for gin or lemon for lime. I’m talking about this: given apple juice, bourbon, Cointreau, and lemons, can I make a recipe with the same basic profile as a daiquiri by plugging in a few numbers? Yes, I can. It won’t taste like a daiquiri, but it will have the same feel. I developed several recipes in this book mathematically, but I won’t tell you which ones for fear you’ll be prejudiced against them.\n\nI don’t really know how I feel about this ability. It’s a little disconcerting. I tell myself that I still need to understand how flavors work together, I still need a brain and a palate—and that’s true. All the math in the world won’t help you if you can’t put good flavors together. And the math isn’t always right, either. Some drinks are better with more than average sugar or acid, some with less. The math will only give you the backbone of the drink—its structure. The soul of the drink will be the aromatics and flavors you choose. But the math has been incredibly useful to me for judging existing cocktail recipes and for developing my own.\n\nIt is easy to replicate the basic profile of a recipe you like in a new drink so long as you know the alcohol, sugar, and acid contents of your ingredients and target alcohol, sugar, acid, and dilution numbers for the recipe profile you want to emulate. To that end, my recipes specify alcohol content, sugar content, acidity, and final beverage size. To calculate new recipes of your own based on my numbers, you’ll need to be armed with a list of the alcohol, sugar, and acid content of potential ingredients."
