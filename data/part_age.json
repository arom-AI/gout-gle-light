Seed\n\nEach organ is described generally with further detailed exploration planned in another chapter.\n\n### Roots\n- **Function**: Anchors the plant, absorbs and conducts moisture and nutrients.\n- **Characteristics**: Typically tough, fibrous, and barely edible, some exceptions include roots like carrots and parsnips that store energy, making them swell up during temperate-zone winter or seasonal dryness in the tropics.\n\n### Storage in Roots\n- **Carrot**: Has storage tissue around the central vascular core, less flavorful.\n- **Beet**: Develops concentric layers of storage and vascular tissue.\n\n### Stems, Stalks, Tubers, and Rhizomes\n- **Main Function**: Conducts nutrients between the root and leaves, supporting aboveground organs.\n- **Stem Types**: \n  - Hypocotyl (e.g., carrots, turnips), part stem, part root.\n  - Some plants like potatoes and yams develop nonsexual underground structures (tubers like true yam and rhizomes like ginger).\n\n### Leaves\n- **Specialization**: Produces high-energy sugar molecules via photosynthesis, requiring sunlight and ample carbon dioxide.\n- **Tissue Characteristics**: Contains little storage or strengthening tissue, often spongy to expose many cells to the air.\n\nThe chapter seemingly aims to provide a detailed scientific analysis of plant anatomy and its relevance to the properties and practical uses of fruits and vegetables, as evidenced by the detailed discussion of roots’ structure and function in different conditions. An illustration of a \"Cross section of a leaf\" accompanies the text, emphasizing the structure of leaf tissues in relation to photosynthesis."

    "contenu": "# Factors that Affect the Price of Wine\n\nIt is impossible to discuss all of these in detail in this chapter, not least because there are so many differences between individual markets. However, it is possible to highlight the key common factors that apply throughout the world. These include the costs associated with the production, packing, transport and retailing of wine.\n\n## PRODUCTION COSTS\nProduction costs can be divided into grape growing and winemaking.\n\n### Grape Growing\nEstablishing a vineyard is very expensive. The land itself is not cheap, especially if it is located in a region with a reputation for producing premium quality wines. The soil needs to be prepared, vines bought and planted and the trellis (if one is to be used) built. It takes many years to see a return on these initial investments.\n\nIn an established vineyard, vines need attention throughout the year. Labor is usually the largest production cost. This can be kept low by relying on a seasonal, casual workforce or mechanisation. If growers are able to share labour or machines then further savings are possible. However, in some isolated vineyards or sites with extremely steep slopes these economies are not available and production costs are much higher.\n\n### Winemaking\nThe most obvious costs involved in winemaking are equipping and maintaining the winery with the necessary equipment. The most high-tech machines can be very expensive but even small, modestly equipped wineries will need to invest a lot of money relative to their size. Some equipment (such as bottling facilities) can be shared, reducing some of these costs.\n\nAnother important consideration is the amount of time the wines may need to be kept before release for sale. Some wines are matured for several months or even years, as required by local production regulations. Storage facilities can be expensive to maintain. Furthermore, a great deal of money is tied up in stock that cannot be sold to generate a profit straight away.\n\nIn addition to practical considerations, the price of grapes can be dramatically affected by market forces (see page 72).\n\n**Caption:** Incredibly steep vineyards, such as these in Mosel, are more expensive to cultivate than flat land, adding to a producer’s costs."

Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n### Variation\nTo serve this with clams:\n- In a large pot, combine 4 pounds manila clams and 1 cup white wine.\n- Cover, bring to a boil, steam until the clams open, about 5 minutes.\n- Using a slotted spoon, remove the clams from the pan as they open and add them to the tomato sauce.\n- Strain the clam juices through a cheesecloth-lined strainer and add to the warm tomato sauce along with the peas.\n\n### Note\nTaste the liquid in which the tomatoes are packed. If it is too salty, too tart, or metallic-tasting, discard. Tomatoes packed in puree may be sweeter, but taste to make sure. Muir Glen is recommended as a good brand.\n\n### Cooking Insights\n- Spanish cooks appreciate variations involving shellfish, peas, and mint.\n- The dish involves calamari (squid) with a traditional sauce thickened with bread, almonds, and bread, popular in Rome.\n- Key characteristics include less garlic and absence of tomatoes or mint.\n  \n### Personal Reflection (Joyce)\nThe dish served with potatoes or rice, celebrated the flavors but used less garlic. \n\n### Personal Story (Evan)\nDescribes an experience pairing the dish with a Spanish Rueda wine, made from Verdejo grapes, noting its likeness to fuller-bodied Sauvignon Blancs, and its pairing potential with richer and fruity oils.\n\n### Recommended Producers of Earthy, Pungent, Waxy-Textured Sauvignon Blancs\n\n#### Everyday\n- Michel Lynch (Bordeaux, France)\n- Château Bonnet (Bordeaux, France)\n- Covey Run (Greater Columbia Valley, Washington)\n\n#### Premium\n- Château Carbonnieux (Bordeaux, France)\n- Château La Louvière (Bordeaux, France)\n- Cakebread Cellars (Napa Valley, California)\n\n#### Splurge\n- Château Smith-Haut-Lafitte (Bordeaux, France)\n- Château de Fieuzal (Bordeaux, France)\n- Domaine de Chevalier (Bordeaux, France)\n\nEach category offers producer suggestions tailored to varying budget levels, recommending specific wineries from different regions that produce desirable characteristics in Sauvignon Blanc to complement such dishes."

Placez les champignons dans un grand saladier; ils vont prendre du volume en se réhydratant. Versez de l'eau chaude pour les recouvrir.\n  2. Laissez gonfler une quinzaine de minutes les shiitakes, les cèpes... Pour les morilles, comptez 30 minutes.\n  3. Égouttez-les en les pressant légèrement au-dessus d'un récipient en récupérant le liquide de trempage.\n  4. Filtrez ce liquide à nouveau avant utilisation en sauce ou bouillon.\n- **Bon à savoir:**\n  - Les champignons peuvent aussi être réhydratés à l'eau froide, 8 à 10 heures à température.\n- **Idées recettes:**\n  - Riz sauté aux shiitakes, pâk choï et noix de cajou, p. 242\n  - Lo han chai, p. 327\n  - Raviolis chinois au tofu et champignons noirs, p. 316\n\n### Réhydrater des algues séchées (Rehydrating Dried Seaweed)\n- **Temps de trempage:** 10 à 30 minutes\n- **Ingrédients:**\n  - Algues séchées de votre choix\n  - Eau\n- **Instructions:**\n  1. Trempez les algues dans une grande quantité d'eau froide. Le temps de trempage varie : 10 minutes pour la laitue de mer, le wakamé et la dulse, jusqu'à 30 minutes pour le kombu et le haricot de mer, jusqu'à ce que la texture plus ferme. Une fois gonflée, égouttez soigneusement l'algue.\n  2. Rincez uniquement le kombu et les spaghettis de mer, les autres algues peuvent être directement préparées selon la recette.\n- **Le conseil du chef:**\n  - Une fois réhydratées, consommez les algues dans les 24 heures.\n- **Bon à savoir:**\n  - Le séchage des algues tend à casser leurs fibres, ce qui les rend plus tendres et plus digestes que si on les consomme fraîches.\n- **Idées recettes:**\n  - Croquettes à la dulse et salade d'asperges crues, p. 343\n  - Ochazuke aux spaghetti de mer et enoki, p. 334\n  - Tartare d'algues, p. 335\n\nThis structured approach reflects the meticulous and methodical instructions in the image for rehydrating these dried ingredients, providing clear steps and additional culinary advice and recipe links."

Here is a structured summary of the content covered:\n\n**Title**: THE SCIENCE OF SAUCES\n\n**Main Points**:\n1. **Role of Thickening Agents**:\n   - Thickening agents slow the flow of sauces, giving sauces a thicker consistency by binding the liquid into small local masses.\n   - They remove sauce materials from circulation, reducing the fluidity of the continuous phase.\n\n2. **Mechanics of Thickening**:\n   - Various substances in dispersed phase can give different textures to watery fluids.\n   - Solid particles can make sauces grainy or smooth.\n   - Oil droplets provide creaminess.\n   - Dispersed molecules increase thickness, making sauces sticky or slimy.\n   - Air bubbles add lightness and evanescence to sauces.\n\n3. **Types of Thickening**:\n   - There are four common ways to thicken sauces, each utilizing a different physical system which imparts unique characteristics to the sauce.\n\n4. **Cloudy Suspensions: Thickening with Particles**:\n   - Ingredients like vegetables, fruits, herbs, and meats, when used in sauces, create cloudy suspensions.\n   - Such suspensions are composed of plant or animal tissue particles that thicken by interfering with the liquid's flow.\n\n5. **Properties of Suspensions**:\n   - Suspensions in sauces contain solid particles and fluid, causing them to tend to be opaque.\n   - The texture depends on the size of the particles; smaller particles make the suspension smoother.\n   - These particles can absorb or reflect light, influencing the appearance of the sauce.\n\nThe section ends by explaining how thickening a liquid with microscopic chunks of plant or animal tissue suspended in the liquid affects the liquid’s flow, thereby altering the sauce's texture and consistency."

Sourdough remains largely a novelty except in artisan bakeries.\n     - It contrasts the speed and uniformity benefits of isolated yeast with the positive attributes of traditional mixed-culture leavens, like the flavor complexity and moist texture."

Yet the most disappointing wine I ever tasted was also a Pinot Noir. Sampling the possibilities of this incredibly captivating and fickle grape can make you feel like Goldilocks in the Three Bears’ house, always searching for the choice that’s just right. The challenge may be rooted in Pinot’s precise needs—perfect climate, just the right amount of oak treatment to add complexity, and precise tannin management to ensure a silky and pleasing mouthfeel. When Pinot Noir does strike that exact balance, nothing is better.  Alas, that’s far from a sure bet.  Pinot Noir is the most evocative, provocative, and mysterious varietal grown. The best efforts at Pinot Noir (regardless of origin) are lush, exotic, spicy, and sexy. The worst are green, stalky, and bitter. But when it’s good, it can be very, very good. The darling of sommeliers, Pinot Noir is, in my opinion, the most food-friendly red wine. I look at it as a white wine in red wine clothing, because it’s soft on tannin, long on acidity, and chock-full of fruit and food-related flavors. It’s been claimed that almost one out of every ten bottles sold in American fine-dining restaurants is Pinot Noir. Read on and understand why.\n\n#### WINE-GROWING AREAS\n\nOne of the oldest grapes on the planet, Pinot Noir originated in France, although there are stellar examples produced in other parts of the globe with temperate to cool climates. As with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, as a still wine, finds its spiritual grounding in Burgundy’s Côte d’Or, where a fine Vosne-Romanée, Clos de la Roche, or Echézeaux can bring tears to the eyes. The awesome combination of red cherry, lavender, smoky or sweet oak, and a hint of what the French call *animal* can simply be nirvana.  Also like Chardonnay, Pinot Noir is a mainstay in the production of Champagne and sparkling wines around the world, contributing body and complexity as well as abundant fruit and an intrinsic spiciness."

Rustic and undistinguished on its own.\n- **CHARDONNAY, MARSANNE, SAUVIGNON BLANC, SÉMILLON, AND VIOGNIER**: Commonly used in blends, especially in more modern avant-garde wines.\n- **CLAIRETTE**: Very common blending grape in traditional white wines. Can have pretty aromas and good acidity.\n- **GRENACHE BLANC**: White clone of grenache. Very common blending grape in traditional white wines. Can make delicious, citrusy wines of personality.\n- **ROLLE**: Also known as vermentino. Adds freshness and vivacity to blends.\n- **UGNI BLANC**: Undistinguished, common blending grape.\n\n#### REDS\n\n- **BRAQUET, CALITOR, CARIGNAN, CINSAUT, FOLLE NOIRE, AND TIBOUREN**: Grapes used in blending. At low yields, carignan can have real character, and cinsaut is a major force in many rosés.\n- **CABERNET SAUVIGNON**: Used in some of the best reds and rosés, especially in the appellations Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence and Côtes de Provence.\n- **GRENACHE**: Common blending grape used in many reds and most rosés. Can add delicious berry flavors.\n- **MOURVÈDRE**: Major grape, used in many of the top reds and rosés for structure.\n- **SYRAH**: Fairly minor grape in Provence, but used in some of the very best reds.\n\n### BANDOL\n\nThe best appellation in Provence, Bandol is a relatively small seaside region about a 30-mile (48-kilometer) drive southeast from the center of Marseille. The best Bandol rosés (Domaines Ott’s Cuvée Marine, for example) usually have a higher percentage of spicy, structured mourvèdre than less well-favored examples. But red wines are where the real action is. These are deep, wild, leathery, spicy wines. By law, they must be 50 percent mourvèdre, and some producers use as much as 100 percent.\n\nThere are dozens of small producers in Bandol, as well as cooperatives. The most famous producer is Domaine Tempier, owned by the Peyraud family. Like romantic characters out of a novel on the alluring back-to-basics Provençal lifestyle, the Peyrauds not only make some of Provence’s most ravishing red and rosé wines on their humble, charming estate but they are also among the region’s best cooks. The matriarch of the family, Lulu Peyraud, was a mentor to the famous California chef Alice Waters."

When wine drinkers talk about Côte d’Or they are almost assuredly talking about wines from here.\n\nThe Côte d’Or is a narrow ridge of limestone, divided almost equally in half. The northern part, known as the Côte de Nuits, produces red wines almost exclusively. The southern half, the Côte de Beaune, produces both red and white wines, although whites— including the ultra-famous wines Puligny-Montrachet and Chassagne-Montrachet—dominate. (For the villages in each part, see The Villages of Burgundy, page 200.) In between the Côte de Nuits and the Côte de Beaune is the village of Comblanchien— famous not for wine, but for its dusty quarries full of Comblanchien limestone and marble.\n\n---"

A 3-5% salt brine can tenderize the fish by causing it to absorb both water and salt.\n\n2. **Handling Delicate Flesh**\n   - It emphasizes the delicate nature of fish tissues that are fragile when cooked. Care during and post-cooking is crucial to maintain the structural coherence of the fish flesh.\n\n3. **Techniques for Cooking Fish and Shellfish**\n   - Discusses \"dry\" heating methods like grilling, frying, baking, which prompt browning reactions. In contrast, \"moist” techniques like steaming and poaching do not trigger these reactions.\n   - **Grilling and Broiling**: These techniques utilize high temperatures and radiant heat, suitable for relatively thin pieces of whole fish or fillets.\n\n### Table: Mush-Prone Fish and Shellfish\nJapanese studies have indicated that certain fish and shellfish with active protein-digesting enzymes in their muscle can become mushy when cooked slowly or held at temperatures around 130–140°F/55–60°C.\n\n| Fish/Shellfish | Type      |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| Sardine        | Fish      |\n| Herring        | Fish      |\n| Mackerel       | Fish      |\n| Tunas          | Fish      |\n| Chum salmon    | Fish      |\n| Whiting        | Fish      |\n| Pollack        | Fish      |\n| Tilapia        | Fish      |\n| Shrimp         | Shellfish |\n| Lobster        | Shellfish |\n\nThis structured content highlights the document's focus on the intricacies and recommended practices in the handling and cooking of fish and shellfish to optimize texture and flavor."

Here is a structured breakdown of the content provided in the text:\n\n1. **Temperature Management:**\n   - **Objective:** It's crucial to manage excessive heat in the fermentation process since it can kill the mold.\n   - **Method:** Allow the oven to heat up and then maintain the temperature by propping open the door if the temperature exceeds the desired range.\n\n2. **Handling Dry Heat in Oven:**\n   - **Challenge:** Dry heat from sources like a pilot light or a lightbulb can quickly dry out the substrate, inhibiting mold development.\n   - **Solution:** Use a plastic bag with tiny holes to house the inoculated beans for tempeh. This setup keeps most humidity in and allows air circulation, simulating the traditional use of banana leaves in Indonesia.\n\n3. **Wrapping Grains for Koji:**\n   - **Method:** Wrap the grain in breathable fabric to prevent it from drying out too quickly.\n   - **Details:** More specifics on wrappings will be provided in discussions about each type of ferment.\n\n4. **Safety Note for Oven Use:**\n   - **Precaution:** Cover the oven controls with masking tape or a note to prevent accidental turning on of the oven at high heat, which could destroy the ferment.\n\nOverall, these guidelines are aimed at ensuring a controlled environment for fermenting processes like making tempeh and koji, addressing common problems such as excessive drying and accidental heating."

    "contenu": "The document is divided into two main sections: an informational section about yogurt and a recipe section titled \"Yogurt, red pepper & daikon sprouts\". Below, I've structured the content corresponding to each section:\n\n---\n\n### Yogurt\n\n**Introduction**\n- Yogurt is produced through the bacterial fermentation of milk, consisting of a complex mix of volatile organic compounds. These include compounds that are already present in milk and those that develop during the fermentation process, transforming milk fats, lactose, and citrate into creamy, cheesy-buttery, and fruity, apple-scented aroma molecules.\n\n**Fermentation Process**\n- The fermentation of lactose in milk by the bacteria *Lactobacillus bulgaricus* and *Streptococcus thermophilus* results in lactic acids which denature the milk proteins, contributing to yogurt's creamy texture. Humans can absorb these enzymatic lactase in the small intestine, which aids in breaking down lactose (milk sugars) into simpler sugars.\n\n**Cultural Relevance and Variants**\n- In certain cultures, a high percentage of people develop lactose intolerance, but continued ingestion of yogurt is beneficial due to the lactose digestion that occurs during fermentation.\n- Commercially produced yogurt usually comes from cow's milk but can also be made from goats' or sheep's milk. Yogurts from specific regions like Bulgaria and the Balkans are often thought to be creamier and less acidic, and richer in protein and fat compared to standard yogurt.\n\n**Types of Yogurt and Related Products**\n- **Skyr**: Similar to Greek yogurt but considered a cheese due to its rennet-enhanced bacterial cultures.\n- **Kefir**: A fermented milk product not technically classified as yogurt, using yeasts as well as *Lactobacillus* bacteria.\n- **Cultured buttermilk**: Utilizes *Lactobacillus lactis* and *Leuconostoc citrovorum* bacteria, known for creating a butter-like flavour.\n- **Labneh**: A strained yogurt from the Middle East mixed with olive oil, za'atar, sesame seeds, and dried sumac.\n\n**Serving Suggestions**\n- Yogurt serves well in dips combined with cucumber and other fresh herbs around the world, ranging from raita in India to tarator in the Balkans.\n- For a salty twist, tarator can include chopped walnuts and syrniki, a type of cheese pancake, ideally served with seaweed and suitable with poached or pan-fried fish.\n\n---\n\n### Yogurt, Red Pepper & Daikon Sprouts Recipe\n\n**Description**\n- This recipe is intended as a light palate refresher to impress guests. The ingredients include yogurt, dark chocolate, cayenne pepper, and daikon sprouts.\n\n**Preparation Steps**\n1. Prepare dark chocolate cylinders and let them set overnight.\n2. Whip yogurt with cayenne pepper for pungency.\n3. Dice roasted red bell peppers very finely and gently fold them into the whipped yogurt.\n4. Pipe the mixture into the chocolate cylinders.\n5. Garnish with fresh daikon sprouts and additional diced roasted red bell peppers.\n6. Serve chilled, allowing the sweet and spicy flavours of the yogurt mousse to meld with the bitter notes of dark chocolate and the peppery pungency of the daikon sprouts.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- This combination makes for a visually appealing and sophisticated dessert, balancing a variety of flavors and textures.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "The document discusses the approach and philosophy behind developing cocktails, emphasizing the importance and interplay of ingredients. It highlights the balance between complexity and extravagance in cocktail creation. The text indicates that while some cocktails may contain many ingredients used in small quantities, the addition of each component is always questioned for its necessity and contribution to the overall drink. More complexity or ingredients do not necessarily equate to better drinking experience; rather, the goal is to achieve a cocktail that is greater than the sum of its parts. The document suggests that, when recipes in the book feature long lists of ingredients, it is because those ingredients have been carefully selected and balanced to enhance the final cocktail effectively."
