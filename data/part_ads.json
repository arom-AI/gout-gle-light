Here's the structured content based on the text:\n\n### Ice Cream\n\n**Overview**: \nIce cream is described as a culinary delight that enhances the natural qualities of cream. The process of freezing not only adds to the creaminess and texture but also poses a challenge due to the need to freeze it correctly to retain its desired qualities.\n\n**The Invention and Evolution of Ice Cream**:\n- **Consistency**: Initially, frozen cream is as hard as rock due to its sugar content, which lowers the freezing point and modifies the texture by preventing the sugar molecules from crystallizing completely.\n- **Historical Development**: The use of salts to lower the freezing point dates back to the 13th-century in Arab regions, with the term \"ice cream\" first documented from Charles II’s court in 1672. Notable progress in the development of ice creams in France and Naples occurred in the late 17th century, particularly noted around the time of the American Revolution.\n- **French Techniques**: By the era of the French Revolution, frequent stirring methods were discovered to make ice cream smoother, with finer texture, and rich versions including those made with up to 20 egg yolks and flavored with vanilla, nuts, spices, or orange blossoms.\n\n**The First Recipes for Ice Cream**:\n1. **Neige de fleurs d'orange (\"Snow of Orange Flowers\")** (1682):\n   - **Ingredients**: Sweet cream, powdered sugar, orange flowers, and a pot of potful of wine.\n   - **Preparation**: Mix the ingredients, crush them if needed, and layer with ice and salt in a cooler. Stir occasionally until the mixture firms up, which takes about two hours.\n\n2. **Fromage à l'angloise (English Cheese)**:\n   - **Ingredients**: 16 oz of sweet cream, same amount of milk, half a pound of powdered sugar, three egg yolks.\n   - **Preparation**: Boil the ingredients until they thicken like a fine porridge, then cool in ice molds for three hours. Warm slightly before serving to make unmolding easier.\n\n**References**:\n- François Massialot, _La Nouvelle instruction pour les confitures_ (1692).\n\nThis structured summary captures the text’s details concerning the historical context, physical properties, and first recipes relevant to the development of ice cream as detailed in the document."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"FRUITS USED AS VEGETABLES\" provides detailed information regarding the use, storage, and characteristics of certain fruits commonly used as vegetables, specifically focusing on tomatoes and tomatillos. Below is a structured summary of the key points found in the document:\n\n### Tomatoes\n- **Toxicity Concerns**: Tomato leaves contain alkaloid tomatine, which binds tightly to cholesterol molecules in the digestive system, potentially reducing the intake of cholesterol.\n- **Cooking**: Tomatoes easily cook down to a smooth puree but can be made firm by adding calcium salts which interfere with their disintegration during cooking.\n- **Storage**: Originating from a warm climate, tomatoes should be stored at room temperature. They suffer from refrigeration, which can inhibit flavor development. To recover, refrigerated tomatoes should be left at room temperature before eating.\n- **Varieties**: The \"tree tomato\" is described as a tough and bland fruit, related but not specifically detailed in flavor characteristics.\n\n### Tomatillos\n- **Description**: Tomatillos, fruits of *Physalis ixocarpa*, were cultivated before tomatoes. They are smaller, enclosed in a papery husk, and have a sticky surface.\n- **Flavor Profile**: When ripe, tomatillos retain a mild, green flavor suitable for cooking and adding depth to sauces.\n- **Varieties**: Noted is the purple variety called *miltomate* which is more esteemed.\n\n### Capsicums or Sweet Peppers\n- **Origin and Usage**: Capsicums, like tomatoes, originate from the New World. They play a significant role in various cuisines, particularly in Mexico, Spain, Hungary, among others.\n- **Attributes**: Capsicums are hollow berries with a relatively thin wall. They are selected for their ability to dry easily and are used in various forms including whole spices.\n- **Flavor Development**: Domesticated in five species from the genus *Capsicum*, the most vegetable varieties derive from *C. annuum*. These varieties are often mild and eaten as vegetables though they can spice up dishes when needed.\n- **Color Variations**: Ripening affects the color, which can turn to shades of yellow, orange, red, brown, or purple due to pigment mixing.\n\nThis summary describes the nuances of how these fruits are utilized, stored, and valued in culinary practices, emphasizing their importance in diverse food cultures."

    "contenu": "### Nut Flavor\nNuts provide us with a distinctive, appealing, and versatile set of flavors. Nuttiness is a cluster of qualities: slightly sweet, slightly fatty, slightly roasted or toasted; a delicate flavor, yet with some depth. The nuts’ ample endowment of oil is key to their character; the less rich grains take on a pleasant flavor when simply toasted dry, but develop an added dimension when cooked in or fat. The quality of nuttiness complements many other foods, whether savory or sweet, all the way from fish to chocolate.\nMost nuts contain at least traces of free sugars. Some contain more than a trace and are noticeably sweet; these include chestnuts, cashews, pistachios, and pine nuts.\n\n### Handling and Storing Nuts\nThe same high oil content that makes nuts nutritious and delicious also makes them much more fragile than grains and legumes: that oil readily absorbs odors from the surroundings, and goes rancid when it’s split into its component fatty acids and the fatty acids are then fragmented by oxygen and light. The fatty acids have an irritating effect on the mouth, while their fragments have cardboard, paint-like aromas. Walnuts, pecans, cashews, and peanuts are rich in fragile polyunsaturated fats and are especially susceptible to stalIng. Fat rancidity is favored by bruising, light, heat, and moisture, so it’s best to store nuts in opaque containers at cool temperatures. Shell-less kernels are best refrigerated. Because they contain very little water and so don’t suffer from the formation of damaging ice crystals, nuts can be frozen for long keeping. Storage containers should be truly air- and odor-tight—glass jars, for example, rather than permeable plastic bags.\nNuts are at their best when they’re freshly harvested, usually in late summer and fall (early summer for almonds). Newly harvested nuts are too moist to keep without being vulnerable to molds, so producers dry them with as little heat as possible, usually at 90-100°F/32-38°C. When buying fresh nuts, look for an opaque, off-white interior. Any translucency or darkening is a sign that the cells are damaged, oil has been released, and rancidity is developing.\n\n### Cooking Nuts\nUnlike most other seed foods, nuts are good simply oven-toasted or fried for a few minutes, which transforms the chewy, pliable, bland, pale seeds into crisp, flavorful, browned morsels. They can also be roasted in the microwave oven. Since nuts are small and dry, frying is generally done at relatively low temperatures for relatively short times, 250-350°F/120-175°C for a few minutes, with lower temperatures and longer times for large nuts (Brazil nuts, macadamias). Doneness should be judged by color and flavor, not texture; heat softens the tissue, which gets crisp as it cools. Stop the cooking just short of the ideal doneness, since nuts continue to cook for some time after they're taken from the heat. Nuts are less brittle when they’re warm, so slicing them while warm can give cleaner pieces with fewer flakes and crumbs.\nCommercially prepared nuts are often roasted, salted with special flake-shaped particles that have more of a surface to adhere to the nut, then coated with a layer of oil or a protein-emulsifier blend to help retain the salt. Peanuts are salted in the shell by being soaked in brine under a vacuum, which pulls the air from inside the shell and forces the brine in.\n\n### Removing Skins\nMany preparations call for nut skins to be removed so that they don’t discolor the dish or add unwanted astringency. Thin skins—those on peanuts and hazelnuts, for example—can often be made brittle enough to rub off by a brief toasting in the oven. The thicker skins of almonds are toughened and loosened by a minute or two in boiling water. Others can often be removed by immersing the nuts in boiling water."

    "contenu": "### Pack\n\nOnce vegetables are nice and moist, through bruising or soaking, they can be further salted or spiced, if desired, and packed into vessels. (See [chapter 3](#) for more discussion on different types of vessels.) Whether you seal them in a jar or ferment them in a crock, stuff vegetables into the vessel tightly so that air pockets are forced out and liquid rises, submerging the vegetables. If the vegetables are not fully submerged, press hard on them a few times to see if you can force a little more juice out. If you keep pressing, or leave the bruised vegetables under a weight for a few hours, more juice will come out. If the vegetables are not fully submerged by the next morning, or if at any point it seems that water has been lost (in an open crock due to evaporation), simply add a little dechlorinated water. Getting the vegetables submerged is the most critical factor for success in vegetable fermentation.\n\nIn the salty brine environment, the vegetables have a tendency to float, much like our bodies in the ocean. In a crock, people generally place a weight upon the vegetables to force them down and keep them submerged (see [Crock Method in chapter 3](#)). One method of accomplishing this in a jar is to cut a chunk of a root vegetable, or the heart of a cabbage, into the shape of a plug or a disk to place on the surface of the vegetables protruding just a bit from the mouth of the jar. Forcing the lid down and securing it will have the effect of pushing down the plug and the vegetables, keeping all but the plug itself submerged. Some people have brine for several hours or longer—just a few hours in a moderately salty mix—then drained before mixing with spices. See the [Kimchi](#) section for details on this method."

A twist on the obvious, select an older wine to accompany rarer cuts and, conversely, a wine that's youthful and juicy to go with longer-cooked meat or stews.\n- **With grilled foods.**\n  - Grilling adds a bitter component to the food and creates a great stage for Cabernet’s tannins.\n- **With bitter foods.**\n  - From mustard greens to radicchio, from braised escarole to endive or roasted eggplant, bitter items pair well with Cabernet’s tannins.\n- **With foods or treatments that pick up on the wine’s oak character.**\n  - Grilling, smoking, and plank roasting mirror oak’s characteristics and its impact on wine. The incorporation of toasted or roasted nuts or a charred soy-honey glaze on meat will echo similar tastes in the wine.\n- **At countering fat.**\n  - Creamy, buttery, or otherwise fat-laden dishes that coat the mouth with a light film of texture will be lovely with a chewy Cabernet.\n- **With black pepper.**\n  - On steak, as a crust for tuna, or simply added generously but judiciously to a dish, pepper will tame Cabernet’s tannic bite. This combination works best with younger wines.\n- **With earthy and herbal elements.**\n  - In particular, wines that stress similar flavors (those from Bordeaux, Washington State, and New Zealand) are complemented by fresh herbs and dark mushrooms.\n\n#### Cabernet doesn’t work well:\n- **With delicate and subtle dishes.**\n  - Its personality is just too bold. Think of placing a blowhard in the same room as a wallflower: it’s a recipe for failure.\n- **With strong cheeses.**\n  - Counterintuitively, the stronger the cheese, the less successful the match. Opt for milder cheeses that won’t fight with the wine for attention.\n- **With most fish.**\n  - Meatier and less oily fish are generally the best matches (ahi tuna, swordfish, shark).\n- **With spicy-hot foods.**\n  - The capsaicins create a storm by ratcheting up the perception of the wine’s alcohol while accentuating the bitter and astringent nature of the tannins.\n- **With dishes that have no fat or protein (such as plain risotto or crudités).**\n  - These may well accentuate the wine’s bitterness.\n- **With most chocolate.**\n  - Really. Never mind what you’ve heard. While bitter and semisweet chocolate can work well with a ripe American or Australian Cabernet (in a not-too-sweet mole sauce for example), most chocolate is simply too sweet for any dry red wine, and it never pairs well with the austere wines of Bordeaux."

Raw milk's benefits include being a living food, assuming the animals are healthy and graze on adequate land.\n\n2. **Business Aspect:**\n   There's a movement among farmers toward managing small dairy herds and selling raw milk directly as a business strategy. This contrasts with the mass production and selling to bulk processors.\n\n3. **Animal Welfare and Production Methods:**\n   The prevailing US milk industry leverages methods like reducing land per animal and using artificial growth hormones to maximize milk production, which can compromise milk quality and safety.\n\n4. **Concern about Large Scale Farms:**\n   Animals in large farms or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) do not have the health advantages or the quality of life that smaller, pasture-based farms provide. Consequently, their milk also lacks certain healthful qualities.\n\n5. **Pasteurization and Safety:**\n   The text argues that while pasteurization is necessary for milk from large scale farms due to high bacterial counts and other issues, raw milk could be safe if produced in better conditions (i.e., animals with more space and better environments).\n\n6. **Cultural and Legal Dimensions:**\n   The discussion also touches on the intensive legal struggles over raw milk distribution and its safety, nutritional aspects, and the author advocates for a change in perspective and policy towards raw milk.\n\n7. **References and Further Reading:**\n   The author suggests consulting more detailed writings and resources for further information, including his previous book, *\"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved,\"* and other material available in printed or digital formats.\n\nThe document aims to challenge the current dairy industry standards and promote a shift towards more sustainable and consumer-friendly practices, particularly advocating for the consumption of raw milk under right conditions."

    "contenu": "The document provides a detailed overview of different types of wines and specific styles within fortified wines, particularly focusing on Port, Sherry, and Vermouth. Here's a structured content analysis of the document:\n\n### 1. Madeira\n   - **Description**: Madeira is a variety of fortified wine, heated and aged using a method that involves initial sweetening, followed by artificial heating and aging in barrels.\n   - **Styles**: From sweet to nearly dry.\n\n### 2. Port\n   - **Origin**: Port wine originated as a British solution to preserve Portuguese wine by fortifying it with brandy.\n   - **Processing**: It involves halting fermentation of red wine with spirits, aging in barrels, and then bottling; older ports have a maple-like compound aroma.\n   - **Age**: Can be aged from two to fifty years.\n\n### 3. Sherry\n   - **Type**: A fortified, oxidized white wine developed in Spain.\n   - **Method**: Uses the solar system for maturation, allowing wines to oxidize and concentrate through a sequence of casks partially filled.\n   - **Variety**: Includes slightly different preparation techniques and degrees of heating or cultivation.\n\n### 4. Vermouth\n   - **Description**: A fortified wine that originated as a medicinal drink utilizing wormwood, popular in 18th-century Italy but now mainly used in mixed drinks.\n   - **Characteristic**: Generally contains about 18% alcohol by volume.\n\n### Styles of Sherry Detailed:\n   - **Fino**: Lightest, least fortified, and oxidized; protected by a surface layer of yeast called flor.\n   - **Amontillado**: Essentially fino sherry that did not retain the flor, causing it to be more oxidized, darker, and heavier.\n   - **Oloroso**: Strongly fortified, does not develop flor, resulting in a significant increase in alcohol content and a darker, more concentrated wine.\n\nThis structured content helps understand the unique production techniques and characteristics of various fortified wines, illustrating the cultural and technological influences in winemaking."
