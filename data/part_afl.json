    "contenu": "### Floral Herbal\n\nFloral herbal ingredients are, for the most part, green and leafy but they also include such things as lemongrass and, for certain purposes, lemon zest or ginger. We call them floral because they remind us of flowers and their delicate aromas. They often serve to pull up and locus specific tastes. Thus, the herbs that have a licoricey taste, such as tarragon and basil, will pull up the sweet side of a recipe. Rosemary, thyme, and oregano accent saltiness, meatiness, and fishiness, as well as helping to define the garden tastes of tomato, peppers, and so on. Chili peppers and cilantro go together so well that in Mexican cooking it is hard to find picante tastes without cilantro alongside. Lemon zest and ginger accent the element in fruit that differentiates it from pure sugar.\n\nIn context, some other ingredients can serve a floral herbal function from time to time. Olive oil has a floral aspect that works well with herbs and makes it superior to other oils or butter when you want to bring out the garden vegetable side of things. Likewise, honey adds a floral note to sweetness that sets it apart from cane sugar or maple syrup. We use the word *floral* metaphorically, but it can also be taken literally. For example, New Delhi chefs bathe some desserts in rosewater, and the Zapotecs of Oaxaca, Mexico, make a memorable quail with rose petals.\n\n### Spiced Aromatic\n\nIf we return to our musical analogy, floral herbs discussed above are like a harp or chimes—maybe even a piccolo: they are there as ornament and accent, delicate as lace, brittle as rime ice. The ingredients that we think of as spiced aromatic—such as cinnamon, cloves, allspice, mace, coriander seed, cumin—are robust in flavor and function principally in enhancing the depth and complexity of food."

Here's an organized summary of the key concepts and details presented in the text:\n\n### Dry Peaks and Beyond\n- **Stiff-Peak Stage**: Egg foam at this stage is well aerated with about 90% air, with the protein webs beginning to catch on each other. Further beating at this stage adds little value.\n- **Slip-and-Streak Stage**: This stage is characterized by a duller appearance and crumbly consistency. \n- **Importance of Sugar**: Directly after reaching the high stiffness stage, adding sugar helps stabilize the foam. Sugar absorbs water from the proteins and delays over-beating.\n- **Role of Tartar and Tools**: Tartar or acidic conditions in cake or soufflé making help by starting protein bonding, thus stabilizing the foam. Different beaters or whisks can influence the foam's texture.\n\n### Meringues: Sweet Foams on Their Own\n- **Integration in Recipes**: Meringues are often used alone or folded into batters and fillings.\n- **Properties**: When sugar is added to beaten egg whites, it forms a glossy and stable meringue. \n- **Sugar Proportions**: For sparkling meringues, a ratio of sugar to egg white volume can vary from 1:1 to about 2:1.\n- **Types of Sugars**: Dissolvability of sugar is crucial, with finer sugars being preferable for meringue making due to better moisture absorption.\n\n### Meringue Types\n- **Varieties**: Traditional meringue terminologies include French, Italian, and Swiss, which describe different methods of preparation.\n\nThis text provides detailed insights into the stages of beating egg whites into foam, the impact of adding sugar, and the importance of understanding the characteristics and types of meringues."

It is structured into two sections:\n\n1. **Tannins act as natural antioxidant preservatives, affecting how red wines develop and change with age.**\n   - This section explores how tannins serve as natural antioxidants in red wines, affecting their development and aging process. Without tannins, red wines like low-tannin Beaujolais would degrade quickly. Tannins, originating from the grape skins, slow down the oxidation process, helping wines to age more gracefully and usually resulting in softer wines as they mature. High-tannin reds, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, can endure over time due to their high tannin content derived from small berries and thick skins.\n\n2. **Depth of color was once a good predictor of tannin, but not anymore.**\n   - This section discusses the historical perspective where darker wines were believed to contain more tannins, which was associated with longevity and flavor. However, this is no longer the case. The market now prefers wines ready to drink on release, with softer, more velvety tannins, which is contrary to the older belief that wines needed to be dark and intensely tannic to be good. The section further explains that modern preferences lean towards wines that achieve flavor and richness more quickly, without needing to age as long, paralleling the wine industry’s response to consumer demand for wines that are smoother and less tannic when released.\n\nThis document appears to be from page 67 of a section titled \"Wine Tasting.\" The content provides insight into the evolution of wine production techniques and market demands that influence how wines are developed and perceived based on their tannin levels."

Here’s a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Durum Wheat for Pasta\n- **Advantages**: Durum wheats have less gluten content but more gluten strength, making dough easier to roll out. Water in durum wheat doughs comprises around 30% of dough weight, less than in bread doughs.\n- **Process**: Ingredients are kneaded into a stiff mass allowing flour to absorb water and develop gluten. With time, gluten networks organize, making the dough elastic and easier to stretch.\n\n### Egg Pasta and Fresh Pasta\n- **Use of Eggs**: Eggs enhance color and richness, provide additional protein, and make the dough tender and cohesive.\n- **Geographical Preference**: Preferred in Northern Europe and the U.S. Usually, eggs are used in larger proportions in U.S. commercial noodles to improve texture and reduce cooking losses.\n- **Specific Example**: In parts of Italy, doughs with up to 18 yolks per pound of flour are common.\n\n### Durum Pasta Making\n- **Standard Italian Pastas**: Made from semolina with a coarse particle size (0.15–0.5 mm across). The durability of durum's coarse particles reduces damage during dough formation.\n- **Extrusion Process**: Pastas are shaped by extruding dough through dies under high pressure; this alters the dough structure, enhancing protein networking.\n- **Resulting Texture**: Noodles extruded through modern Teflon dies have a smoother and more durable texture, are less prone to breaking, and absorb less cooking water during boiling.\n\n### Egg Pasta Production\n- **Production Method**: For egg pasta, ingredients are mixed and kneaded into a stiff dough, rested, rolled, and cut to size.\n- **Quality Considerations**: Fresh egg pasta is perishable, prone to contamination, and should be cooked or refrigerated promptly to prevent microbial growth. \n\nThis document provides technical details on pasta production techniques and the roles of different ingredients in pasta doughs."

It advocates for the use of starter cultures to standardize quality.\n   - Despite their advantages, starter cultures often result in less complex flavors as they involve only a few species of microorganisms.\n\n3. **Cultural and Safety Perspectives**:\n   - Food historian Ken Albala and other critics argue that modern safety and predictability requirements have lead to bland and homogeneous food products.\n   - Modern practices include using lab-tested microorganisms and processes like pasteurization, which some believe strip products of their unique, local qualities.\n\n4. **Contemporary Challenges for Artisan Producers**:\n   - Ken Albala mentions that traditional methods, like mixing sausage ingredients with bare hands, were effective in introducing fermenting bacteria in a natural manner. This method is considered safe and traditional, aligning with practices used until a few decades ago.\n   - Currently, artisan salami makers using traditional methods are facing pressures from regulators, who demand adherence to newer safety standards.\n\n5. **Debate on Traditional vs. Modern Practices**:\n   - The document reflects a tension between maintaining traditional food-making practices and adhering to contemporary safety and uniformity standards imposed by regulators and industrial market demands.\n\nThis summary captures the key points discussed in the text related to the production and cultural implications of traditional versus modern fermented sausage manufacturing."

If you are making an apple crisp, if you added a teaspoon of zest it would taste very different than if you added lemon juice. The juice would make it taste tart, whereas the zest would actually add a lemon flavor component to it. For ice cream, custards, and tarts, use lemon juice. But if you are going to combine lemon with other flavors, that’s when you use zest.\"\n\n- **Gina DePalma, Babbo (New York City)**:\n  \"Use lemon juice when you want the acid and lemony flavor of the juice. If you want the perfume of the lemon, use the zest because the skin is where you get the essential oils. I use more lemon and orange than vanilla in my cooking because they are more prevalent in Italy and in Italian cooking, and a flavor profile that people recognize as Italian.\"\n\n- **Emily Luchetti, Farallon (San Francisco)**:\n  \"Lemon can be used by itself or with other ingredients because it enhances so many flavors. An orange can be a little too mellow, but lemon makes flavors much brighter. Lemon is an underlying flavor as much as the star.

You can shake a drink in pretty much any vessel that can hold ice and liquid and seals tightly. Heck, even a screw-top water bottle will work in a MacGyver-esque pinch. But some shakers make the task easier than others.\n\n**Boston shakers:**\nUntil fairly recently, the standard setup was the Boston shaker, which consists of a pint glass and a large metal shaking tin. Back when most bartenders free poured their spirits instead of measuring them with a jigger, the pint glass allowed them to eyeball how much booze was going into the glass. Now that jiggering is more the rule than the exception, using glass to shake drinks isn’t as necessary. That’s a good thing, because the Boston setup has numerous drawbacks:\n- The difference in weight between the pint glass (heavy) and the tin (light) makes for an awkwardly balanced shake.\n- A room-temperature pint glass won't get the drink as cold as a room-temperature metal tin (a fine point of thermodynamics we’ll explain later in this chapter).\n- Boston shakers generally terrify us, as pint glasses tend to crack and shatter without warning or come unsealed from the tin and turn into a deadly projectile while spraying the drink all over the bar.\n- Every bartender who has used a Boston shaker has war stories.\n\n---\n\nThe text is supported by an image showing various types of glasses identified as (clockwise, from top left): pint glass, stemmed glass, paddle glass, Yarai glass. These graphics give visual context to the types of glasses possibly used in different shakers, particularly the pint glass discussed in relation to the Boston shaker."

It is structured in several sections, each discussing different materials and methods:\n\n1. **Wheat Paste for Urban Art:**\n   - The document starts with a description of using wheat paste in street art. Wheat paste is mixed with earthen plasters, enhancing the stickiness. However, mixing should be limited to immediate use since fermentation overnight makes the paste overly thin and less cohesive.\n\n2. **Casein in Plasters:**\n   - Casein, a milk protein that forms when milk curdles, is effective in earthen plasters. When milk proteins (caseins) organize into micelles, they react under acid conditions to form larger clusters, similar to the process in cheesemaking. Casein can be derived from yogurt, milk curdled with rennet or vinegar, buttermilk, or even from powdered milk. Casein's binding properties allow restructuring liquid milk into solid forms which can be useful in plasters.\n\n3. **Lime-Based Paint with Fermented Cactus:**\n   - Another section talks about a lime-based paint made using fermented cactus, sourced from personal anecdotes involving the author's friends, Annie Danger and Rayna. They used this fermentation-based paint for a non-toxic painting process on an apartment in San Francisco. The fermented cactus acts as a sticky/glossy agent in the paint, contributing to its unique properties.\n\n4. **General Preparation Tips:**\n   - The document ends with a brief mention on the general preparation steps for any lime-based paint, emphasizing the hydration process of lime.\n\nEach section not only highlights the natural ingredients used but also touches on personal experiences and practical advice for using these materials in artistic applications.

    "contenu": "## Cooking Fresh Meat\n\n### Grilling and Broiling\nThe term “grilling” is generally used to mean cooking meat on a metal grate directly over the heat source, while “broiling” means cooking meat in a pan below the heat source. The heat source may be glowing coals, an open gas flame, or ceramic blocks heated by a gas flame, or a glowing electrical element. The primary means of heat transfer is infrared radiation, the direct emission of energy in the form of light; hence the glow of coals, flames, and heating elements. The meat surface, which is very few inches away from the heat, is only a few inches away and burns at around 3,000°F/1,650°C, coals and electrical elements glow at 2,000°F/1,100°C. Because these temperatures can blacken food surfaces before the inside is cooked through, grilling is limited to such relatively thin and tender cuts as chops, steaks, poultry parts, and fish.\n\nThe most flexible grill arrangement is a dense bed of glowing coals or high gas flame under one area for surface browning, sparser coals or a lower gas flame under another for cooking through, and the distance between meat and fire an inch or two. The meat is cooked over high heat to brown each side well but as briefly as possible, in two or three minutes, and then moved to the cooler area to heat through gently and evenly.\n\n### Spit-Roasting\nSpit-roasting—impaling meat on a metal or wood spike and turning it continuously near the radiating heat source—is best suited to large, bulky cuts, including roasts and whole animals. It exposes the meat surface to browning temperatures, but it does so both evenly and intermittently. Each area receives an intense, browning blast of infrared radiation, but only for a few seconds. During the many seconds when it faces away from the heat, the hot surface gives up much of its heat to the air, so only a fraction of each blast penetrates into the meat, and the interior therefore cooks through relatively gently. In addition, the constant rotation causes the juices to cling to and travel around the meat surface, basting and coating it with proteins and sugars for the browning reactions.\n\nThe full advantages of spit roasting are obtained when the roasting is done in the open air, or in an oven with the door ajar. A closed oven quickly heats up to baking temperatures, and the meat will accordingly heat through less gently.\n\n### Barbecuing\nThis distinctly American cooking method took its modern form about a century ago. Barbecuing is the low-temperature, slow heating of meat in a closed chamber by means of hot air from smoldering wood coals. It’s an outdoor cousin to the slow oven roast, and produces smoky, fall-apart tender meat.\n\nModern barbecuing devices allow the ...\n\n\n### Food Words: Barbecue\n\nThe term `barbecue` comes via the Spanish `barbacoa` from the West Indies, and a Taino word that meant a framework of green sticks suspended on corner posts, on which meat, fish, and other foods were laid and cooked in the open over fire and coals. Both the height and the fire were adjustable, so food could either be quickly grilled or slowly smoked and dried. In American colonial times the `barbecue` was a popular and festive bout of mass outdoor meat cooking. By the beginning of the 20th century it had evolved into the familiar slow cooking of highly flavored meat."

Below is the structured content of the text extracted from the document:\n\n---\n\n**Preparation & Handling of Kefir:**\n\n1. **Microbial Activity Monitoring:**\n   - The active microbial activity on the grains' surface requires periodic agitation to distribute the activity throughout the milk, which helps in thickening the kefir.\n\n2. **Temperature and Time:**\n   - Kefir is generally ready when it has thickened, which typically takes about 24 hours, but this can vary with temperature and personal taste preferences.\n\n3. **Final Steps Before Use:**\n   - Before using kefir, give the jar a final shake and remove the grains. Grains can be removed using a spoon or by straining.\n   - To carbonate kefir, it should be transferred to a sealable vessel with some room for expansion and left to ferment for a few more hours or days in the refrigerator. Upon opening, it will froth and rise.\n\n4. **Type of Milk:**\n   - Various types of milk can be used to make kefir, including whole milk (preferably raw), nonfat milk, pasteurized milk, ultra-pasteurized milk, goat’s milk, and cow’s milk (both homogenized and not).\n\n5. **Tips and Personal Experiences:**\n   - The document mentions a personal anecdote where the author's friend, Nina, prefers nonfat milk for making kefir. The author themselves have had success with different types of milk.\n\n6. **Considerations with Metal Contact:**\n   - Some literature advises against letting kefir grains come into contact with metal due to potential corrosive reactions.
