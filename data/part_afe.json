The wine simply called Beaumes-de-Venise is a dry red, like its better-known sisters Vacqueyras and Gigondas. But the village is more famous for its historic fortified sweet wine, muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, made from the brazenly aromatic grape muscat blanc à petits grains.\n\nDrinking a glass of it is a powerful experience thanks to the fortification, and while peach, apricot, and orange flavors dance in the glass, the wine is not sugary sweet. Indeed, southern Rhône locals often drink it as an aperitif. Among the best muscats of Beaumes-de-Venise are those from Paul Jaboulet Aîné, Domaine Durban, Domaine Coyeux, and Vidal-Fleury."

The kieselsol mops up the last cloudy particles (Image labeled as \"3\").\n  - **Resulting Clarity Issue**: Despite these efforts, the final clarity of the juice in the last glass remains low.\n\n**Advice for Thick or Non-Settling Products Using Agar**\n- **Recommendation**: For products that are inherently thick, don't settle well, or are more acidic than grapefruit, it's suggested to use agar for clarification.\n- **Specific Instructions**:\n  - **Type of Agar**: Use powdered agar, which is the easiest to handle.\n  - **Consistency in Brand**: Always purchase the same brand of agar as different brands might have varying effects.\n\nThis interpretation offers a guide on how to effectively utilize certain techniques and products (agar, kieselsol, separatory funnel) for the purpose of liquid clarification in food processing, highlighting the specific challenges and recommendations to achieve desired clarity in beverages."

Older vintages of Graham's, Dow's, Warre's, and other Ports are ready to be tasted in the Symington family lodges.\n\n### Main Header\n**SINGLE-QUINTA VINTAGE PORT**\n\n### Content\nThe word **quinta** means farm, but in the Douro most quintas would be more accurately described as renowned vineyard estates. They range in size from a dozen to several hundred acres and usually include a house and sometimes gardens, in the manner of a French château. The grapes for a single-quinta vintage Port come, as the name implies, from a given quinta in a single year. The idea behind these Ports is that the very best vineyard estates are often located in special mesoclimates that allow exceptional wines to be made even in years when the vintage as a whole may not be declared.\n\nSingle quintas may be owned by small shipper-firms, such as Quinta do Infantado, which makes a single-quinta vintage Port by the same name. Or the quinta might be owned by a large shipper. The famous Quinta do Vesuvio, for example, is owned by the Symington family, which also owns the firms Graham’s, Warre’s, and Dow’s. But in all cases, a single-quinta vintage Port will always be made exclusively from the grapes grown at that quinta. (Remember that, by contrast, a vintage Port may come from grapes from several quintas, as well as grapes grown by dozens of small, individual grape growers.) It’s important to note that shippers may decide not to make a single-quinta vintage Port in the same year they make a vintage Port. In years declared for vintage Port, the quinta’s grapes may be blended into the vintage Port and thus cannot be made into a wine of their own.\n\n---"

Various suggestions on flavors and pairings with dessert wines are provided by different individuals named Joyce and Evan. Here's the structured content from the document:\n\n### Excerpt:\nI love the special Christmas dessert called croquembouche, with its crunchy caramel-coated cream puffs stacked in a dramatic pyramid. However, for the average diner, it’s easier to serve a deconstructed version of the dessert, with no intricate architectural work required. The crunch of the cream puff (or choux pastry) and caramel coating is a fabulous contrast to the custard filling.\n\nI’ve also given a creamy caramel sauce that can be spooned over custard- or ice-cream-filled puffs. It does not develop the crunchy exterior of the simple caramel. It is, however, easier to prepare, as the puffs don’t need to be dipped in the hot syrup. The results are excellent but different.\n—Joyce\n\nCustard, caramel, honey, and vanilla are the classic pairings for botrytized dessert wines, and I suppose you could go for the grand slam by using honey as the sweetener in this dessert. In this dessert, the caramel and vanilla complement the wine's barrel-aged elements (many of these wines are aged in oak), while the custard's rich texture is splendid against these more luscious wines. The flavors of botrytized white fruit are honey, pears, peaches, and apricots, which can be highlighted by adding Grand Marnier to the caramel sauce. While this is a playful accent, it’s not obligatory, as the wine’s fruit will also pair nicely against the creamy flavor and consistency of the pastry cream.\n—Evan\n\n### Recommended Producers:\n#### Botrytised Dessert Wines\n\n| Category  | Producers                                            |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Everyday  | Hogue (Greater Columbia Valley, Washington)          |\n|           | Domaine de la Motte (Loire Valley, France)           |\n|           | Kiona (Yakima Valley, Washington)                    |\n| Premium   | Chateau Doisy-Daëne (Sauternes, France)              |\n|           | Beringer (Napa Valley, California)                   |\n|           | Domaine de Baumard (Loire Valley, France)            |\n| Splurge   | Dr. Bürklin-Wolf (Pfalz, Germany)                    |\n|           | Chateau Rieussec (Sauternes/Barsac, France)          |\n|           | Domaine Weinbach (Alsace, France)                    |\n\nThis table categorizes wine producers into \"Everyday\", \"Premium\", and \"Splurge\" tiers."

The text notes that without some temperature drop at night, it would be challenging for Texas to produce good wine. The narrative explains that due to the relatively warmer climate, the vines in Texas often exit their winter dormancy early, allowing the grapes to be harvested end of July. This early harvesting period is two to three months before California and most European wine regions, potentially leading to a lack of sufficient hang time in cooler temperatures which can impact the complexity of the wines.

The existence of the Great Dividing Range introduces mountainous and hilly terrains, covering a significant portion of the state. Proximity to the Great Southern Ocean endows certain regions like the Yarra Valley, Geelong, and Mornington Peninsula, with cool breezes advantageous for wine grape cultivation. Notably, regions slightly inland like Beechworth are favourable for producing rich, stellar Chardonnays, such as those from the Giaconda Estate. Victoria is also recognized for quality Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz from producers like Yarra Yering and Mount Mary, which contribute to outstanding red blends.\n\n**Specialty Wines:**\nVictoria is renowned for its sweet muscats and topaques predominantly produced in northeastern Rutherglen by established vineyards like Chambers Rosewood Vineyards and Campbell Wines. These wines are distinctively rich and viscous.\n\n**Sparkling Wine Production:**\nHistorically significant, Victoria houses some of Australia's pivotal sparkling wine producers. Seppelt is noted as one of the oldest and most influential, residing within the Grampians district. In 1986, further emphasizing the region's reputation, the prestigious Moët & Chandon established Chandon Australia in Victoria.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n1. Throughout its history, the latter decades of the 20th century marked significant growth phases for Victoria's wine industry, overcoming challenges like phylloxera, which led to the adoption of resistant rootstocks.\n2. The geographic diversity within proximity to mountain ranges and ocean influences distinctly characterizes the wine produced in this region.\n3. Victoria's claim to fame extends to crafting unique varietal wines and noteworthy contributions to the sparkling wine sector on a global level."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the aging potential of wines based on their color and type. Here’s the content structured in a textual format:\n\n### Among Top-Quality Wines, Reds are the Most Likely to Improve, Whites do Not Keep as Well, and Pink Rosés Fade Most Quickly\n\nGrape skins are rich in astringent tannins and dark anthocyanins, two phenolics that help preserve wine. Over time, they merge into larger complex compounds, which are eventually precipitated as sediment. This process takes years and leaves the mature red wine paler in color and softer in mouthfeel. In general, the red wines from the thickest-skinned grapes that are darkest in youth are those most likely to make wines with the potential for long-term aging.\n\nBecause grape skins are discarded when making white wine, whites are generally lower in preservative phenolics. Instead, acidity can extend white wine’s life. High-acid whites such as Riesling deteriorate much more slowly than richer whites, including Chardonnay. Rosé wines are the least stable, with most of them noticeably “tired” by the time of the next year’s harvest.\n\n#### Aging Potential of Common Wine Styles\n\n**Long Term**\n- **White:** Riesling, Chenin Blanc\n- **Red:** Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah/Shiraz\n\n**Medium Term**\n- **White:** Chardonnay, Grüner Veltliner, Semillon\n- **Red:** Merlot, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Sangiovese, Grenache\n\n**Short Term**\n- **White:** Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Viognier\n- **Red:** Zinfandel, Gamay, Dolcetto\n\nThis structured content highlights that the aging capability of wines varies mainly based on the type of grape, the color of the wine, and the processing methods used, with red wines generally showing better potential for long-term aging compared to whites and rosés."

Here's a structured summary of the document's content:\n\n### Human Behavior and Cultural Evolution in Food Storage\n- **Comparison with Animals**: Anthropologist Sidney Mintz points out that unlike animals like squirrels, which instinctively collect and hide food, humans engage in food collection and storage through constructed, symbolically transmitted knowledge.\n- **Role of Culture and Symbols**: In human societies, cultural information is crucial; it is passed through language and other symbols. This enhances ancient coevolutionary relationships. The theorist David Rindos argues that developments in agroecology stem from human capabilities to employ symbols.\n- **Language and Resources**: Language allows humans to classify resources by utility and potential, leading to the preferential preservation of resources before their utility is obvious. According to the text, this capability enhances coevolutionary relationships.\n- **Genes and Memes**: Human genes are complemented by memes (cultural genes), which act as vectors of coevolutionary change. This introduces new methods of cultivation, storage, and processing that involve substantial communication and education.\n- **Challenges of Food Storage**: Implementing technology in food storage has led to creative solutions like fermentation and improved food conservation (e.g., maintaining optimal dryness and temperature). \n- **Learning from Storage Challenges**: The text describes the collection of storage techniques as requiring adaptation from learning through errors, such as issues with moisture in seeds, fermenting vegetables, and the aging of meat in various environments.\n\nThis structure highlights the major points discussed in the document, encompassing theoretical frameworks, empirical observations, and practical insights into human behavior related to food storage and cultural evolution."

    "contenu": "## Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n### Producing High-Volume, Inexpensive White Wines\nThese wines are enjoyed by a large portion of wine consumers but are not particularly complex. They provide excellent value and often come from trusted sources. The simplicity in style and taste comes from the selection of grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio which are typically labeled simply as 'dry white' or 'fruity white.' These wines are often neutral in flavor, restrained in vertical character, and aimed at a broad range of consumers. Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio typically do both easy to ripen and can thrive in varied climates, although they often require careful handling at harvest due to their tendency to quickly oxidize.\n\nKey points:\n- Wines often come from grape varieties like Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio.\n- Aim for high volumes via blending different grape varieties.\n- Generally offer a clean, straightforward taste.\n- Special handling during harvest to minimize rapid oxidation.\n\n### Winemaking Choices\nThese high-volume wines often focus on primary fruit flavors and careful handling to avoid oxidation. The winemaking process is monitored to ensure the wine is handled protectively. The grapes are destemmed and crushed, then pressed. These wines are grown in warm or hot regions which can influence the acidity levels - careful adjustments might be made if the acid levels are too low.\n\nKey points:\n- Focus on simplicity and preserving primary fruit flavors.\n- Protective handling of the winemaking process to prevent oxidation.\n- Common adjustments include acid level corrections.\n\n### Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling\nWhile not typically associated with high-volume, inexpensive wines, Sauvignon Blanc can be used for such products due to its robust flavors and ability to thrive even in less ideal growing conditions. Unlike Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio, the strong herbaceous flavors of Sauvignon Blanc can dominate unless the fruit is very ripe.\n\nKey points:\n- Sometimes used for high-volume wines.\n- Capable of thriving in varied conditions.\n- Strong, often herbaceous flavors that require careful ripeness management.\n\n### Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) and Sugar Control\nFor wines like Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio, controlling malolactic fermentation (MLF) is crucial. MLF is often blocked or controlled to maintain the fruity qualities of the wine. In other instances, some residual sugar might be left or added to enhance sweetness, especially if the wines are aimed at markets that prefer a slightly sweeter taste.\n \nKey points:\n- MLF may be blocked or controlled to maintain fruitiness.\n- Residual sugars can be adjusted to appeal to specific consumer preferences.\n\n### Wine Storage and Fermentation Containers\nStainless steel tanks are often used because they can prevent additional oxidation and maintain the integrity of the fruity, fresh characteristics of these wines. The choice of fermentation vessel can significantly impact the style and quality of the white wines produced.\n\nKey points:\n- Stainless steel tanks preferred for their oxidation-resistant qualities.\n- Helps preserve fresh, fruity flavors."

    "contenu": "### PORT'S FLAVOR PARADOX\n\nFrom a flavor standpoint, Port is one of the most paradoxical wines in the world. You would think that a wine made from very ripe grapes that have been grown in a severely hot climate (a wine that is then fortified with more alcohol!) would have thick, somewhat dull, raisiny flavors, and that the wine would be anything but fresh and lively. But great Ports are exactly that—fresh and vivid, often with \"cool\" blueberry and menthol flavors. Port winemakers attribute Port's paradoxical freshness to the centuries of adaptation the local grapes have undergone. Even in blistering heat, these varieties have \"learned\" to hold on to their acidity. In addition, Port's flavors are often given a tactile lift from a sense of minerality that Port winemakers say is evident in great years and may be in part related to the region's schist soils.\n\nAged tawny Ports are among the best-loved Ports in Portugal, France, and Britain, where they are often drunk both as an aperitif and at the close of a meal.\n\nA quick word about a sister style called young tawny Port (as opposed to aged tawny Port, described above). Basic and uncomplicated, young tawny is less than three years old (which is almost oxymoronic, since the word tawny implies the wine has been aged long enough for the color to brown). In the case of a young tawny, the grapes yield a lighter-colored wine. The wine may then be made even lighter by minimizing the time the juice stays on the skins during fermentation. Young tawnies, as a result, have a pale, onionskin color. In Europe, they are often drunk straight up, or on the rocks as an aperitif, although we don’t see them much in the New World.\n\n### RESERVE PORT\n\nReserve Port is an easily affordable, good-quality, “every-night” Port. (Up until 2002, this was called “vintage character,” but the term was subsequently determined to be confusing.) Reserve Ports have bold, red berry flavors that make them popular in the United States and Britain. Many have proprietary names. For example: Dow’s AJS, Fonseca’s Bin 27, Graham’s Six Grapes, Sandeman’s Founder’s Reserve, and Warre’s"

With dietary changes away from dairy, Lisa experimented with grains such as millet to recreate similar dishes, adapting traditional recipes to suit new tastes and dietary preferences.\n\n**Recipe: Millet Polenta**\n1. **Ingredients:**\n   - ¼ cup (50 ml) millet\n   - 2 teaspoons (10 ml) salt\n   - Water\n   - 1½ cups (350 ml) water (for cooking)\n   - Optional spices (1 teaspoon/5 ml each): oregano, turmeric, cumin, paprika\n   - 3 tablespoons (45 ml) olive oil\n   - 1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice (optional)\n\n2. **Preparation:**\n   - Begin by placing ¼ cup millet into a quart-sized mason jar.\n   - Add 2 teaspoons of salt.\n   - Fill the jar to the rim with water, cover with cheesecloth, and allow the jar to sit in a warm place for 24 hours to 2 days.\n   - After the resting period, strain and rinse the millet.\n   - Transfer the rinsed millet to a cooking pot, add 1½ cups of water and bring to a boil.\n   - Reduce heat to simmer and add optional spices like oregano, turmeric, cumin, and paprika.\n   - Allow the mixture to simmer for about 20 minutes or until the millet thickens, stirring occasionally.\n\n3. **Cooking:**\n   - Once the millet has thickened (similar to oatmeal consistency), add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and optionally, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.\n   - Continue cooking on low heat until fully cooked and has achieved a thick consistency.\n   - Pour the cooked millet into an 8-by-8-inch (20-by-20 cm) container or a similarly sized mold and allow to cool.\n   - Once cooled, the millet can be sliced and served toasted, grilled, or as is.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n- Millet, like traditional grits or polenta, can be soaked overnight or longer with a starter (if available) to enhance creaminess and digestibility.\n- During cooking, maintain consistent stirring to prevent the millet from clumping or sticking to the bottom of the pot.\n- Keeping a kettle of hot water nearby during the cooking process is advised to adjust consistency or prevent burning.\n\nThis adapted recipe provides a dairy-free substitute for traditional polenta, using fermented millet to enhance both flavor and texture."

Buildings that were once abbeys have often been converted into renowned Italian wine estates, such as Tuscany's Badia a Coltibuono.\n- **ABBOCCATO**: Slightly sweet.\n- **AMABILE**: A little sweeter than ABBOCCATO.\n- **AMARO**: Bitter. Many Italian wines, both white and red, have a slight **amaro** character, which is considered a positive attribute by Italians.\n- **ANNATA**: The year of the vintage.\n- **APPASSIMENTO**: The process of drying grapes on mats or shelving (or hanging them in the air) in protected cool, dry lofts. There, the grapes shrivel and raisinate, concentrating their sugars.\n- **ASCiUTTO**: Totally dry.\n- **AZIENDA AGRICOLA**: Wine estate—this term, sometimes abbreviated Az. Ag., often appears on wine labels, along with the actual name of the wine estate, when the grapes were grown on that estate, and the wine that was produced there as well.\n- **AZIENDA VINICOLA**: The term for a winery. It often appears on wine labels.\n- **AZIENDA VITIVINICOLA**: Grape-growing and wine-making company. Like AZIENDA AGRICOLA and AZIENDA VINICOLA, the term often appears on wine labels.\n\n#### B\n- **BIANCO**: White, as in **vino bianco**: white wine.\n- **BOTTE**: Cask or barrel.\n- **BOTTIGLIA**: Bottle.\n- **BRICCO**: The sunny slope of a hill.\n\n#### C\n- **CANTINA**: Wine cellar, or yet another term for a winery.\n- **CANTINA SOCIALE OR COOPERATIVA**: A growers' cooperative cellar. Italy, like France and Spain, has hundreds of wine co-ops, some of which make good but rarely great wine.\n- **CASA VINICOLA**: A wine firm, usually making wine from wine or grapes it has purchased (as opposed to grapes grown on its own estate). The word casa means “house.”\n- **CASCINA**: Northern Italian term for a farmhouse or estate.\n- **CASTELLO**: The word for “castle.” Several famous Italian wine estates are housed in what were once castles—Castello di Rampolla in Tuscany, for example.\n- **CHIARETTO**: A very light red or even a rosé wine.\n- **CLASSICO**: An official designation, referring to the heart of a DOC zone—by implication the classic or best part. In Chianti, the **classico** zone is so highly regarded that it has a DOC of its own—Chianti Classico.\n- **CONSORZIO**: A consortium of producers of a certain wine, who join forces to control and promote it.\n- **COOPERATIVA**: See CANTINA SOCIALE.\n\n#### D\n- **DENOMINAZIONE DI ORIGINE CONTROLLATA (DOC)**: See page 328."

    "contenu": "### TOKAJI\n\nOver the millennia of wine’s existence, there have been multiple occasions when politics, war, and/or disease have combined to nearly destroy a wine region and its wines. No more poignant example exists than the region Tokaj-Hegyalja (TOKE-eye hedge-AL-ya) and its wine, known as Tokaji (TOKE-eye). Yet despite the historic difficulties that it has endured, the wine that French King Louis XV offered to Madame de Pompadour, calling it *vinum regum, rex vinorum* —“the wine of kings and the king of wines”—is the most profound sweet wine in the world. To drink it means letting go of every assumption you may have of sweet wine, for Tokaji is a flavor world unto itself.\n\nTokaji’s near demise began with the deadly pest phylloxera. As the twentieth century dawned, the vineyards of Tokaji lay in ruin as a result of the insect. Over the next several decades, vineyards were rebuilt only to be devastated again during World War I, the break up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and World War II. But the biggest upheaval was yet to come. In 1949, as Hungary collapsed under Communist rule, wineries and vineyards were confiscated and nationalized. The preciously refined and highly individual sweet wines of Tokaji were blended en masse in big cooperative cellars run by the state. Over subsequent years, vineyards were neglected, equipment deteriorated, the quality of grapes declined drastically, old winemaking traditions were abolished in favor of cheaper, easier shortcuts, and winemaking itself was degraded to the point where it was little more than bureaucratic drudgery. By the mid-1980s, the innocuous wines called Tokaji bore no resemblance to the wines once considered so extraordinarily delicious (not to mention their purported therapeutic and aphrodisiacal properties) that a detachment of Russian soldiers was regularly stationed in the region to procure sufficient supplies and then escort them to the court of Czar Peter the Great.\n\n![Label of Royal Tokaji SZT.

These same vertical chalk pits, called **crayères**, are used today by the Champagne houses to age Champagne. They are miracles of construction that seem to defy physics, and descending into their eerily quiet, cold, dark, humid chambers is an otherworldly experience that no wine drinker should miss. Because the best chalk was often well underground, the **crayères** often go down as far as 120 feet (36 meters). They are shaped like pyramids, so the deepest parts of the **crayères** are also the widest and the tops of the pits are narrow (this limited air exposure in the quarry and kept the chalk moist and soft, and thus easier to cut into large construction blocks). During World War I, when Reims was extensively bombed, twenty thousand people lived for years in the dark **crayères** (no sunlight penetrates). Indeed, the **crayères** under Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart were makeshift hospitals, and under Pommery, a school.\n\n**Image Caption:** The Grand Cru vineyard of Aÿ, in the Vallée de la Marne.\n\n**Vineyard Areas in Champagne:**\n\n| # | Vineyard Area                 | Characteristics                                               |\n|---|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | MONTAGNE DE REIMS            | - Mountain of Reims<br>- South-facing slope<br>- Mostly planted with pinots noir and meunier<br>- Deep chalk layer |\n| 2 | CÔTE DES BLANCS              | - Hillside of whites<br>- Named for the chalky outcroppings near the surface<br>- Planted almost exclusively with chardonnay<br>- Mostly east facing |\n| 3 | VALLÉE DE LA MARNE           | - Valley of the Marne River<br>- Mostly planted with pinot meunier<br>- Soils: clay, sand, and more toward marl |\n| 4 | CÔTE DE SÉZANNE              | - Just south of Côte des Blancs<br>- Mostly east facing<br>- Planted with chardonnay |\n| 5 | CÔTE DES BAR (also known as Aube) | - A region relatively far to the south<br>- Known as the Aube |\n\nFinally, while, as I’ve said, there is only one AOC in Champagne—that is, Champagne—the region encompasses these five main vineyard areas. These are usually not listed on the label, but in investigating any wine, you'll find references to them."
