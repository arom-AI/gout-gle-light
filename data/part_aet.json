Known for his innovative approaches—including his switch from corks to screw caps and the advocacy for unconventional grape varieties—Grahm argued that California's Mediterranean climate was better suited to warmer climate varietals such as those from the Rhône, Spain, and Italy. Grahm suggested reducing the massive acreage of Chardonnay and replanting with these other grapes, a contentious stand at the time.\n\nFurther, Grahm's influence in the U.S. wine scene is noted by his introduction of varied grape types like Syrah and Southern French grapes, and beginning new wine styles that have significantly contributed to the diversity in the American wine industry. His ventures include experimenting with Reisling, Grüner Veltliner, and Chenin Blanc in Washington State, which were seen as audacious but credible efforts.\n\nOther vintners like Jim Clendenen and Bob Lindquist have also taken radical approaches, experimenting with Northern Italian and Southern French varietals respectively. Bob Haas, through his Tablas Creek winery, focused on blending traditional Châteauneuf-du-Pape grapes, influencing other American producers interested in variants like Counoise and Vaccarèse.\n\nMichael Havens was noted for his work with Albariño before its rise in northeastern Spain, and Marimar Torres for her efforts with Tempranillo in Sonoma County’s Green Valley. Similarly, Rudy von Strasser introduced Grüner Veltliner in Napa Valley's Diamond Mountain, demonstrating further diversification in Californian wine varieties.\n\nLastly, Earl Jones of Abacela Winery in Oregon and Doug McCrea of McCrea Cellars in Washington have challenged regional norms by growing Rhône and other Mediterranean grapes, contributing to the evolving landscape of North American wine production.\n\n---"

Below is the structured content based on the provided text.\n\n---\n\n## New Questions About Milk\n\n**Introduction:**\n- Milk is highly valued for its nutritional content, notably its calcium and protein richness. Recent research, however, poses new questions on these attributes.\n\n### Perplexity about Calcium and Osteoporosis\n\n**Bone Construction:**\n- Bones are primarily composed of proteins and calcium phosphate.\n- Bone tissue continuously undergoes a cycle of deconstruction and reconstruction, requiring adequate supply of proteins and calcium from the diet.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Considerable bone mass is lost by women in industrialized countries potentially due to inadequate calcium intake.\n\n**Cultural and Dietary Insights:**\n- It is observed that higher consumption of dairy potentially prevents bone mass loss and osteoporosis.\n- Recommendations in dairy-prevalent countries suggest consuming the equivalent of a quart of milk daily.\n\n**Critique and Perspective:**\n- The emphasis on milk is seen as a culturally specific recommendation, arguably centered around dietary habits of Northern Europeans.\n- The document hints at other global dietary practices which might also support bone health, without relying solely on milk.\n\n## The Many Influences on Bone Health\n\n**Balancing Bone Construction and Deconstruction:**\n- Good bone health is said to stem from a balance of bone building and breaking processes, which rely on calcium and are affected by physical activity and various nutrients.\n\n### Key Nutrients:\n\n**Calcium:**\n- Crucial for bone building.\n- Amount of calcium for bone building is influenced by its excretion through urine.\n\n**Other Nutritional Factors:**\n- Vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, zinc are important for bone health.\n- Vitamin D and certain food sources like fish and shellfish enhance calcium effectiveness.\n\n**Dietary Contributions to Bone Health:**\n- Modern eating habits (high in salt and animal protein) can increase calcium loss.\n- Nutritional sources include eggs, fish, dairy, fortified tofu, and leafy greens like kale, collards, and mustard greens.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- A balanced diet rich in vitamins and moderate in minerals is advocated.\n- Apart from milk, other calcium-rich foods like beans, nuts, corn tortillas, and certain greens are emphasized.\n\n---\n\nThe discussion in the document revolves around the traditional and new perspectives on the role of milk and other dietary sources in maintaining bone health, highlighting a broader nutritional context."

Here's the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n### UNDERSTANDING WINES: EXPLAINING STYLE AND QUALITY\n\n#### BLENDING\n- **Purpose**: To balance out different aspects of the wine such as color, body, tannin, acidity, or flavour.\n- **Technique**: Involves using different press fractions to boost color, flavour, and tannin from more delicate free run wine. Also, it may involve blending wines matured in different types of vessels or woods.\n\n#### Clarification and Stabilisation\n- **Process**: Most red wines undergo fining and/or filtration to improve clarity and stability.\n- **Effect**: This stabilizes the wine, however, some winemakers opt for a natural approach that allows the wines' structure to stabilize during long maturation before bottling.\n\n#### PRODUCING HIGH-VOLUME, INEXPENSIVE RED WINES\n- **Characteristics**: These wines are usually from grape-growing regions that are warm and sunny. They often feature fruitiness and lighter tannins and tend to be very drinkable but are not aged extensively.\n- **Varities**: Common varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah/Shiraz.\n- **Wine Style**: Generally fruity with medium wines may display less complexity and more upfront fruit flavors.\n\n#### Winemaking Choices\n- **Typical Style**: Fruity, low-tannin wines meant to retain fresh, primary fruit characters. Minimal oak usage, if any, to keep the fruit flavours prominent.\n\n#### PRODUCING PREMIUM RED WINES\n- **Cabernet Sauvignon**\n  - **Characteristics**: A thick-skinned variety, often producing wines with strong tannins especially in cooler regions.\n  - **Style**: Wines from regions like the Médoc in Bordeaux can display grippy tannins in their youth but might soften and develop substantial complexity with age.\n\n#### Handling and SO2 Use\n- **Protection**: Wines are handled protectively with SO2 to avoid unnecessary exposure to air.\n- **Fermentation Specs**: Fermentations for these wines typically require temperatures around 22°C to 25°C, which facilitates different fermentation vessels’ use.\n\n#### Post-fermentation and Maturation\n- **Details**: Batches might not need caps to be punched down vigorously, and tannins from the process are typically gentler but sufficient for wine structure.\n- **Barrel choices**: Primarily aged in stainless steel or inexpensive oak and are designed for consumption at a young age without long periods of aging.\n\n#### Winemaking Processes for Different Styles\n- **Options available to winemakers**: Different methodologies like relying on indigenous yeasts or using specific blends of yeasts, ingredient choices like oak barrels, and intervention levels in tannin management reflect the specific style and desired quality of the wine.\n\n---\n\nEach section of the document outlines detailed practices and considerations involved in wine production, emphasizing the different approaches based on the style and quality of wine being produced."

Here are the main wines.\n\n### Riesling\n\nRiesling is Alsace’s most prestigious grape, although the wine made from it is as thoroughly different from German riesling as a wine can be and still come from the same grape—and grown virtually next door to boot! The best German rieslings are fruity, finely etched, exquisitely nuanced wines, low in alcohol, vibrating with acidity, and usually balanced with a softening pinch of sweetness.\n\nAlsace rieslings are not nearly as dainty. These are mostly very dry, broad wines with palate-coating flavors that lean toward gunflint, steel, and minerals, with a limey sort of citrus. Tight and austere when young, the wines begin to come around after two to three years. With a decade or more of age, they take on a richness, as well as a viscosity, that can be stunning.\n\nRiesling is known to be a grape sensitive to its terroir, and this is as true in Alsace as it is elsewhere. Grown in a merely decent vineyard, it makes merely okay wine. Extraordinary riesling requires near-perfect vineyard conditions.\n\nNo discussion of great Alsace riesling could fail to include Trimbach’s Clos Ste.-Hune and Cuvée Frédéric Emile; as well as Domaine Zind Humbrecht’s Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann; Domaine Weinbach’s Cuvée Ste.-Cathérine; Domaine Ostertag’s Fronholz; and Domaine Marcel Deiss’s Altenberg de Bergheim."

The region also produces slightly sweet versions and \"spumantes\" (sparkling wines) made from the same grape.\n- The most popular red wine from this area is Sangiovese di Romagna, typically simple but with some high-quality versions produced by small, diligent producers such as Fattoria Paradiso, Ferrucci, and Tenuta Zerbina.\n\nThis overview not only emphasizes the quality and diversity of the region's produce but also reflects changes in the availability and perception of these locally crafted wines over time."

    "contenu": "Here's a structured content extraction of the provided document:\n\n### Document Content: Wine Pairing Guidelines\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Purity in Dish and Wine Choice\n- **Key Component**: The leading flavor in a dish, like the simplicity of mozzarella in a dish, should determine the wine choice.\n- **Examples**: Suggests that tuna isn't comparable to eggplant or lamb in terms of leading flavor impacting wine choice.\n- **Approach**: Focuses on tightly ingredient-focused dishes to guide wine selection, minimizing concern about other dish components.\n\n#### 2. Consider How the Dish is Prepared\n- **Overview**: Highlights that the method of preparation significantly impacts the wine pairing choice.\n- **Types of Impact**:\n  - **Low-impact**: Includes raw servings and methods like steaming and poaching.\n  - **Medium-impact**: Incorporates cooking methods such as sautéing, deep frying, baking, and stir-frying.\n  - **High-impact**: Involves intense flavors from grilling or smoking, often with the use of woods or charcoal.\n- **Wine Pairing**:\n  - Lighter wines for low-impact methods to complement without overwhelming.\n  - More flavored wines for medium-impact methods.\n  - Bold and intense wines for high-impact methods.\n\n#### 3. Consider Seasoning and Dominant Flavors in the Dish\n- **Key Consideration**: Suggests pairing wines to the sauce or spice—considered the dominant flavor rather than merely the protein.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Citrusy ceviche might pair with tart and tangy Sauvignon Blanc.\n  - Creamy garlic aioli with richer Chardonnay.\n  - Peppery Rhône red with Provençal spices.\n  - Port-wine reduction with a raisiny Zinfandel.\n- **Strategy**: Encourages matching wines to flavors from marinades, spice rubs, sauces, and glazes rather than sticking strictly to protein-based pairings.\n\n### General Advice\n- Emphasizes the importance of matching wine to the flavor profile of the dish rather than traditional wine-to-protein pairings.\n- Encourages experimentation and personal preference in choosing wine pairings."

The vast, ravishing wilderness here, and tranquil, almost reckless beauty is the California of a century ago. Rolling mountains covered in golden grasses and wild oats alternate with immense stands of giant redwoods. In Mendocino, more than a million acres (more than 400,000 hectares) of forest stand majestically amid the vine-covered, sun-dappled hills. Orchards and ranches are sprinkled over the landscape. On the coast, the windswept town of Mendocino is an artists’ hamlet. Mendocino has the largest percentage of organic vineyards of any county in California—nearly 30 percent are certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers—and countless others are organic but not certified.\n\nThe word *mendocino* is a diminutive of de Mendoza, the name of one of the earliest Spanish explorers to come ashore in Mendocino, in the late sixteenth century."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the measurement of carbonation levels in different beverages, using grams of CO2 per liter of beverage (g/l) as the unit of measurement. A comparison is made between the carbonation in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Here is a structured summary of the main points:\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Unit of Measurement for Carbonation**:\n   - Carbonation levels in beverages are quantified in grams of CO2 per liter (g/l).\n   - A volume of CO2 is another unit used, where 1 volume of CO2 equals 2 g/l.\n\n2. **Carbonation Levels in Various Drinks**:\n   - Average cola contains about 7 g/l.\n   - Orange soda and root beer typically have around 5 g/l.\n   - Alcoholic drinks generally have around 8-9 g/l, which can become painful due to the high carbonation.\n\n3. **Carbonation Property of Alcohol**:\n   - CO2 is more soluble in alcohol than in water. Alcoholic drinks with less CO2 can still appear equally bubbly because less CO2 escapes compared to in non-alcoholic drinks.\n   - More alcohol in a drink means more CO2 is needed to achieve the same level of perceived carbonation.\n\n4. **Carbonation in High-Alcohol Content Drinks**:\n   - Champagne, having 12.5 percent alcohol by volume, can have as much as 11.5 to 12 g/l of CO2 dissolved.\n   - In seltzer water, carbonation at this level would be excessive and unpleasant.\n\n5. **General Note on Carbonating Drinks**:\n   - Adding more alcohol in the drink requires more CO2 during the carbonating process.\n   - The document notes the practicality of maintaining consistent temperature and pressure to control the carbonation process, although direct measurement of CO2 added can be done by weighing the drink before and after carbonation to determine the added CO2 (converted to g/l).\n\nBy detailing these points, the document highlights the interaction between alcohol content and carbonation level in beverages and elaborates on the technical measurement aspects of achieving desired carbonation."

    "contenu": "The document presents various culinary uses and pairings of dill (aneth) with different foods and ingredients across various cultural contexts. Below is a structured summary of each section from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Aneth & Fruits de mer\n- **Location:** Sweden\n- **Context**: During the \"kräftskiva\" festival in August, dill is traditionally paired with crayfish. The crayfish are cooked in dill-infused water, which does not have the actual herb but its essence, and are typically eaten with \"våsterbotten\" cheese that has a firm texture and small holes.\n\n### Aneth & Menthe\n- **Components**: Both green mint and dill contain the same natural flavor compound named carvone.\n- **Flavor Profile**: Although both herbs contain carvone, they deliver subtly different sensations in the mouth and nose due to the molecular orientation of carvone.\n- **Use**: Complex preparations ideal for children, challenging to substitute each other effectively.\n\n### Aneth & Noix de coco\n- **Context**: Common in fish and vegetable curries in Indian and especially Laotian cuisine.\n- **Characteristics**: Dill compliments the flavors of coconut and fish with its notes, enhancing the sweetness and richness of the coconut in unforeseen and intricate ways.\n\n### Aneth & Œuf\n- For more details, refer to \"**Œuf & Aneth**\" section.\n\n### Aneth & Pois\n- **Use**: Historically used as a binding agent between diced potatoes and carrots in Russian salad, and now an innovative addition to various modern salads and dishes.\n- **Recipe Suggestion**: Combine 250 g of diced potatoes, 100 g of peas, a mix of carrots, all paired with a mayonnaise made with dill. Serve chilled with added crunch from chopped dill and possibly accompanied by cold meats, cheese, and a crunchy lettuce.\n\n### Aneth & Poisson blanc\n- For more details, see \"**Poisson blanc & Aneth**\" section.\n\n### Aneth & Poisson fumé\n- For more details, see \"**Poisson fumé & Aneth**\" section.\n\n### Aneth & Poisson gras\n- For more details, see \"**Poisson gras & Aneth**\" section.\n\n### Aneth & Pomme de terre\n- **Locations**: Mention of usage in Poland and India.\n- **Application**: In Poland, dill is used in a potato salad, and in India, it's sautéed with potatoes and spices like chili and cumin, enhancing the flavors with its light, inherent aroma which is different from typical European dill usage.\n\n### Aneth & Porc\n- **Usage**: Commonly found in Chinese pork dumplings as a refreshing contrast to the meat's density.\n- **Geographical Mention**: Less common but still used in northern east Chinese original dishes.\n\n--- \n\nThe document provides a culinary guide on integrating dill into different dishes harmoniously, emphasizing its versatility in different culinary traditions globally."

    "contenu": "The document provides detailed information about the process of creating a type of liquor called Justino. Here is the structured summary of its contents:\n\n1. **Background Information About Justinos:**\n   - Justinos utilize Pectinex Ultra SP-L, an enzyme that effectively breaks down the structure of blended fruit in alcoholic solutions for clarification. This is particularly effective in high-alcohol environments.\n\n2. **Development of Justino:**\n   - The author was interested in making a banana-flavored cocktail that wasn’t thick and smoothie-like, which led to experimentation with straight banana juice without additional thick liquids.\n   - The process involved centrifuging the juice to remove pulp and achieve clarity, resulting in a rum with pure banana flavor.\n   - The drink was named \"Justino\" when a reporter inquired about the name during an interview.\n\n3. **Recommendations for Producing Justinos:**\n   - It is suggested to use low-water mixers to maintain a higher alcohol content.\n   - For ingredients with high water content (e.g., honeydew, melon), it is advisable to dry them in a dehydrator before blending with the liquor for better results.\n   - Commercially produced dried fruits are also recommended for creating Justinos.\n\n4. **Limitations:**\n   - The document mentions that starchy products do not work well with the SP-L enzyme, as it does not break down starches. Thus, ingredients like unripe bananas, which contain a lot of starch, are unsuitable for making Justinos.\n\n5. **Specific Ingredient Advice:**\n   - Avoid using high-starch ingredients as they do not clarify well with the techniques generally used in restaurants and bars, hence not yielding good Justinos."

Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### Title\n**Châteauneuf-du-Pape**\n\n### Introduction\nThe document opens by positioning Châteauneuf-du-Pape as one of the most important wine appellations in southern Rhône, comparable only to the north's Côte-Rôtie or Hermitage. It serves as the introductory point for exploring the southern Rhône.\n\n### Main Body\n- **Location and Size**: Châteauneuf-du-Pape is described as the southernmost of the major southern Rhône wine appellations, located about fifteen minutes from Avignon. The region encompasses the town of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and adjacent areas, covering slightly more than 8,000 acres.\n- **Comparison**: The document compares the size of Châteauneuf-du-Pape to other wine regions, noting it is far larger than Hermitage, four times the size of the Napa Valley and thirty-four times larger than Bordeaux based on wine production.\n- **Historical Context**: Initially, most of the Châteauneuf-du-Pape harvest before World War I was sold in bulk for stronger spirits in Burgundy. It mentions a notable shift in quality and reputation beginning in the 1970s.\n- **Wine Characteristics**: The top red wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape are characterized by penetrating and bold flavors rather than being easygoing as might be expected from a Mediterranean region. The flavor profile includes earthy, gamy tastes with an edge of tar, leather, and rough stone. It suggests that these wines pair well with foods such as garlic, black olives, and wild herbs. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe document explains the unique and assertive nature of Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines, contrasting them with other wines of the region and emphasizing their complex flavors suited for bold culinary pairings."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content from the document:\n\n### MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\n#### Loose Wrapping\nTight wrapping in plastic film is inadvisable for three reasons: trapped moisture and restricted oxygen encourages the growth of bacteria and molds, not always the cheese’s own; strong volatiles such as ammonia that would otherwise diffuse from the cheese instead impregnate it; and trace volatile compounds and plastic chemicals migrate into the cheese. Whole, still-developing cheeses should be stored unwrapped or very loosely wrapped, other cheeses loosely wrapped in wax paper. Stand them on a wire rack or turn them frequently to prevent the bottom from getting soggy. It can be fun to play the role of _affineur_ and encourage surface or blue mold growth on a good Camembert or Roquefort to grow on a fresh goat cheese or in a piece of standard Cheddar. But there’s some risk that other microbes will join in. If a piece of cheese develops an unusual surface mold or sliminess or an unusual odor, the safest thing is to discard it. Simply trimming the surface will not remove mold filaments, which can penetrate some distance and may carry toxins (p. 67).\n\n#### Rinds\nShould cheese rinds be eaten? It depends on the cheese and the eater. The rinds of long-aged cheeses are generally tough and slightly rancid, and are best avoided. With softer cheeses it’s largely a matter of taste. The rind can offer an interesting contrast to the interior in both flavor and texture. But if safety is a concern, then consider the rind a protective coating and trim it off.\n\n#### Cooking with Cheese\nWhen used as an ingredient in cooking, cheese can add both flavor and texture: either unctuousness or crispness, depending on circumstances. In most cases, we want the cheese to melt and either mix evenly with other ingredients or spread over a surface. A certain giving cohesiveness is part of the pleasure of melted cheese. Stringy cheese can be enjoyable on pizzas, but a nuisance in more formal dishes. To understand cheese cooking, we need to understand the chemistry of melting.\n\n#### Cheese Melting\nWhat is going on when we melt a piece of cheese? Essentially two things. First, at around 90°F, the milk fat melts, which makes the cheese more supple, and often brings little beads of melted fat to the surface. Then at higher temperatures—around 130°F/55°C for soft cheeses, 150°F/65°C for Cheddar and Swiss types, 180°F/82°C for Parmesan and pecorino—enough of the bonds holding the casein proteins together are broken that the protein matrix collapses, and the piece sags and flows as a thick liquid. Melting behavior is largely determined by water content. Low-moisture hard cheeses require more heat to melt because their protein molecules are more concentrated and so more intimately bonded to each other; when melted, they flow relatively little. Separate pieces of grated mozzarella will melt together, while flecks of Parmesan remain separate. With continued exposure to high heat, moisture will evaporate from the liquified cheese, which gets progressively stiffer and eventually resolidifies. Most cheeses will leak some melted fat, and extensive breakdown of the protein fabric accentuates this in high-fat cheeses. The ratio of fat to surrounding protein is just 0.7 in part-skim Parmesan, around 1 in mozzarella and the alpine cheeses, but 1.3 in Roquefort and Cheddar, which are especially prone to exuding fat when melted.\n\n#### Nonmelting Cheeses\nThere are several kinds of cheese that do not melt on heating; they simply get drier and stiffer. These include Indian paneer and Latin queso blanco, Italian ricotta, and most fresh goat cheeses; all of them are curdled exclusively or primarily by means of acid, not rennet. Rennet creates a malleable structure of large casein micelles held together by relatively few calcium atoms and hydrophobic bonds, so this structure is readily weakened by heat. Acid, on the other hand, dissolves the calcium glue that holds the casein protein together."

    "contenu": "### Where It's Grown\n\n**New Zealand (Auckland: Kumeu, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay), South Africa (Breede River Valley: Robertson; Coastal Region: Paarl, Stellenbosch), U.S.A. (California: multiple appellations), Zimbabwe**\n\nPinotage was created in South Africa in 1925 by Abraham Izak Perold, the first professor of viticulture at Stellenbosch University. He was attempting to combine the best qualities of Cinsaut, a vigorous grape with a reliable history, with Pinot Noir, which had been problematic despite its great potential. Since Cinsaut is known as Hermitage in South Africa, he gave it the hybrid name of Pinotage.\n\n#### Development and Reception\n\nInitial winemaking efforts with the grape were hit-and-miss, and the inconsistency and the flaws were exacerbated by South Africa’s isolation. When Pinotage entered onto the international stage with the end of apartheid, it met with a harsh reception: the wines were ridiculed for odd flavors and other deficiencies. Despite this, time and tough love are great teachers, and the advocates and producers of this variety have learned their lessons. If you haven’t sampled Pinotage before or haven’t done so in a long time, it’s worth a try now. The best examples have always come primarily from the large Cape Region, especially the renowned district of Stellenbosch. Other noteworthy efforts emanate from Paarl and on occasion from outside the Cape Region, in locations like Robertson in the Breede River district. The unique dark fruit and earthy, gamy signature, combined with improved use of oak and reduced yields from established older vineyards, are resulting in distinctive and delicious wines.\n\n#### International Presence\n\nPinotage has, alas, not gained much traction outside South Africa, though it is planted successfully in small quantities in Zimbabwe and has crossed the ocean to New Zealand, where it has also taken root successfully in wine-producing areas like Auckland (Kumeu), Gisborne, and Hawke’s Bay. Some of the best Pinotage-based wines I have tasted are Kiwi in origin. New Zealand is said to be the second largest producer of Pinotage and has more than four decades of experience in making it. California is the lone home of Pinotage in the United States, with a few efforts by wineries in the North Coast region, though there are also said to be some experimental efforts in New York and Virginia.\n\n#### Vintner’s Choices\n\n- **Dry vs. sweet**\n- **Old oak vs. new oak**\n- **Red vs. rosé**\n- **Single variety vs. blend**\n- **Younger vineyards vs. older vineyards**\n\nLike many other grapes, Pinotage is made in a range of styles. It can be quaffable, light, and fruity, like Gamay; deep and rich, like a Grenache-based Rhône blend or a Zinfandel; or elegant, age-worthy, and restrained, like Bordeaux. There are also rosé wines and fortified wines (like port). Successful wines require a winemaker who knows the idiosyncrasies of the grape.\n\n#### Susceptibility to Spoilage\n\nPinotage is very susceptible to a spoilage yeast called Brettanomyces, which is found in a majority of South African vineyards and wineries. Brett, as it’s called colloquially, also occurs in many other parts of the winemaking world, but much as some strains of influenza are more virulent than others, South African brett is very pungent and has to be kept in check."
