    "contenu": "The document appears to be a preface or an introduction from a book about food and drink combinations, specifically focusing on what to drink with what you eat across different years (1996, 2000, 2006-2008). Here is the structured content representation:\n\n---\n\n**Title:**\nFood and Drink Combinations\n**Subtitle:**\nWHAT TO DRINK WITH WHAT YOU EAT\n\n**Content Years:**\n- **Classics 1996**\n- **2000**\n- **2006 2008**\n\n**Main Text:**\nWe believe cooking will continue to evolve, not only as a means of “doing” (i.e., putting dinner on the table, or “problem-solving” by “following a recipe”). Over time, we believe more people — including, perhaps, yourself — will have discovered it as a way of “being” in the world. We have learned enough over the past decade or two to question why cooking is done one way versus another. This thoughtful sensory engagement leads to a store of experiences that allow us to bring more intuition to the cooking process, synthesizing what we’ve done before into innovative approaches to creating a dish. Ultimately, cooking offers the opportunity to be immersed in one’s senses and in the moment like no other activity, uniting the inner and outer selves. At these times, cooking transcends drudgery and becomes a means of meditation and even healing.\n\nIt is little surprise to us, then, that when U.S. Poet Laureate Charles Simic was asked by the New York Times Magazine’s Deborah Solomon earlier this year, “What advice would you give to people who are looking to be happy?” his response was “For starters, learn how to cook.”\n\nWe hope this book makes you happy — literally.\n\n**Authors:**\nKAREN PAGE AND ANDREW DORNENBURG\n\n**Location and Date:**\nNew York City, April 2008\n\n---\n\nThis section likely sets the tone for the book, emphasizing the transformative and philosophical aspects of cooking, not just as a task, but as a holistic practice that involves sensory engagement and personal fulfillment. The reference to a U.S. Poet Laureate suggests that the text values cultural and intellectual insights into everyday activities like cooking."

Here's a structured summary of the information presented in the document:\n\n### Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n**1. Vine Training Techniques**\n   - **Head Training**\n     - Minimal wood; armanent wood grows from a few short arms from the trunk; can either be spur-pruned or replacement cane-pruned.\n   - **Cordon Training**\n     - One or more permanent horizontal arms known as \"cordons\"; typically spur-pruned; allows sturdy attachment which aids mechanical harvesting.\n   - **Vine Pruning**\n     - Involves the removal of unwanted leaves and limbs to promote healthier vine and fruit development; performed annually.\n\n**2. Types of Vineyard Configurations**\n   - **Untrained Vineyards**\n     - Common in regions where vines can grow as tall as the ground allows without the necessity for trellises; not suitable for mechanized harvesting.\n   - **Trellised Vineyards**\n     - Vines are supported by horizontal wires; aimed to manage sunlight exposure and air flow among the vines; typically more labor-intensive.\n\n**3. Canopy Management**\n   - **Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP)**\n     - Widespread system where the vine’s shoots are trained vertically and pruned in a way that keeps them narrow and apart; enhances sunlight exposure and reduces shade.\n\n**4. Winter Vine Management**\n   - **Spur Pruning**\n     - Involved cutting short sections of one-year-old wood that have growth nodes.\n   - **Replacement Cane Pruning**\n     - Uses longer canes from one-year-old wood retained for structural support; more complex and labor-intensive compared to spur pruning.\n\n**5. Canopy Management Goals**\n   - Promotes optimal sunlight exposure and air circulation; involves proper positioning of grapes and maintenance of the canopy to improve overall vine health and ease of harvesting.\n\n**Insights**\n   - Optimal vineyard management involves integrating tactics suited to the regional climate and vine characteristics.\n   - Strategic canopy management facilitates disease control and can improve grape quality and operational efficiency."

The wines were so poor—even by colonial standards—that in 1619 the Virginia Company sent French vine cuttings and eight French winemakers to Jamestown to help establish proper vineyards and make decent wine. That same year, by legislative act, each colonist was required to plant at least ten grapevines. French help proved futile. The maiden vineyards soon died from fungal diseases and pests.\n\n## THE QUICK SIP ON VIRGINIA\n\n- **ATTEMPTS TO MAKE WINE** in Virginia began in 1607—the earliest record of wine production in the United States.\n- **DISEASES, PESTS, and difficult weather** destroyed most of the early vineyards, including those planted by third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson.\n- **THE MODERN ERA** of Virginia wine-making started in the late 1970s with the planting of chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, and other grapes.\n\n![The old barn at Early Mountain Vineyards, along the Monticello Wine Trail in the pastoral Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.

Here's a structured breakdown of its content:\n\n### Pinot Gris\n- **General Characteristics**: Pinot gris can vary significantly depending on where it is grown. It can range from being the best-known but lowest quality Italian pinot grigio to more complex and opulent versions from Alsace, France.\n  \n- **Regional Variations**:\n  - **Italy**: Known for pinot grigio, which is often neutral and serviceable but not exceptional, widely used in basic wine.\n  - **France (Alsace)**: Produces complex, spicy, and opulent pinot gris, considered among the \"noble\" varieties of the region, perfect for those who do not prefer something as aromatic as riesling or gewürztraminer.\n  - **Germany**: Known as grauburgunder, offering broad and sometimes Rubenesque wines.\n  - **Oregon**: Noted for pinot gris with pear and spice-cake flavors.\n  - **California**: Known for crisp wines, sometimes with an edge of pepperiness or arugula-like bitterness.\n  - **Canada (British Columbia)**: Produces the most dependably delicious pinot gris with a cold, sunny, dry climate.\n\n- **Color Variation**: Depending on the mutation, pinot gris grapes can range from bluish silver to mauve-pink to ashen yellow.\n\n### Gris Area\n- **Distinction from Vin Gris**: Pinot gris is different from French vin gris (grey wine), which is a type of slightly pinkish-tinted white wine made from red grapes.\n\n### Pinot Noir\n- **Historical Context**: Pinot noir is over two thousand years old, a founder variety influencing many other well-known grapes. Its exact origin is unknown.\n  \n- **Characteristic**: Considered the likely grandparent of the syrah wine grape. Derived its name from its pine cone-shaped cluster of grapes.\n\n- **Genetic Aspects**: Noted for its genetic instability, which has resulted in hundreds of clones.\n\nThis text provides a detailed introduction to pinot gris and pinot noir, comparing the impact of regional climate and winemaking traditions on their qualities and reputation."

    "contenu": "The document provides information about the winevariety Marsanne, its characteristics, and how it pairs with food.\n\nHere is the extracted content structured as plain text:\n\n---\n\n**Marsanne Characteristics and Pairing**\n\nRarely do we speak of oak and Marsanne in the same sentence. While old, large vats are sometimes used, they mainly serve as vessels for the wine rather than for adding wood notes. The gradual oxidation from using wood vats adds a nutty nuance to the wine. As Marsanne has an inherent tendency to oxidize, the process needs to be carefully managed because the grape can be bland when aged in new oak.\n\nIn regions like the middle Rhône, St.-Péray produces tasty, Champagne-styled sparkling wines of which Marsanne is a component. These wines are often fuller in body than typical sparkling wines, though not overly complex, and are enjoyable. In Switzerland, dessert wines made from Marsanne feature notes of light green herbs, apricots, vanilla, and golden raisins.\n\n**Pairing with Food**\n\nMarsanne available in the United States is typically dry, suitable for pairing with late-harvest Sémillons and other dessert wines. The dessert wines are good with dry bubblies and dishes with higher alcohol levels, especially when preparing spicy foods.\n\nMarsanne pairs well with foods that carry a smooth texture and a creaminess. Sauces that contain cream, butter, or reductions of stock are very successful paired with Marsanne. Rich ingredients like duck, scallops, lobster, and roasted root vegetables are excellent choices. A classic dish like brandade, which is a Provencal preparation of puréed salt cod and potatoes, pairs exceptionally well with Marsanne, as it can handle the cod’s salt quotient without being too alcoholic.\n\nFor spicy foods, care should be taken as Marsanne tends to be quite alcoholic. It is recommended to use red pepper flakes and chilies sparingly and choose dishes with alcohol levels around 13 percent to avoid overwhelming heat and potential gastric combustion.\n\nAging Marsanne can introduce a distinctly nutty tone. This pairs well with foods that have an accent on sweet spices or macadamia-crusted fish, adding components like hazelnuts, cream, or sweet spices to the dish. Further enhancing Marsanne with a hint of orange or tangerine zest in dishes like risotto or even in a savory tart enhances its natural flavor profile.\n\n---\n\nThis summarizes the main points on Marsanne presented in the document."

However, the number of artisanal producers has sharply declined.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Compared to baked ham, Virginia country ham boasts a dramatic, sweet, meaty flavor and can be quite salty. It is comparable to Italian prosciutto, but is typically sliced paper thin.\n  - The best country hams are produced near Smithfield from peanut-fed hogs, are dry-cured with sugar and seasonings, then smoked over hickory wood and aged from three months to one year. The amount of aging affects the saltiness of the meat.\n- **Consumption Tips**: Virginia country ham pairs well with either high-acid wines or sweet wines. Alternatively, non-traditional wines offer an adventurous taste.\n- **Leading Producers**:\n  - Smithfield Packing Co.\n  - Gwaltney of Smithfield\n  - S. Wallace Edwards & Sons\n\n### Vineyards in Eastern Virginia\n- **Soil Composition**:\n  - Most vineyards are on clay and loam soils in the east, while soils in the western part of the state are granite-based.\n- **Climate Challenges**:\n  - Eastern Virginia experiences a continental climate with severe winters that can damage vine trunks and cause bud loss due to springtime frosts. Summers bring excessive heat that can hasten ripening, reducing the quality of the wines. Furthermore, humidity can cause rot, mildew, and disease among the vines.\n  - The hurricane season adds additional threats by overlapping with the harvest period.\n- **Viticulture**:\n  - The challenges necessitate that winemakers and viticulturists be highly skilled and selective about planting locations to mitigate environmental threats.\n\nThe document also includes an image of a wine bottle labeled \"VIRGINIA COUNTRY HAM,\" likely to represent a Virginia wine, highlighting the region's other renowned product alongside its ham."

    "contenu": "The document showcases four different cultural recipes or treatments involving chicken, each paired with a specific flavor or ingredient:\n\n### Poulet & Raisin (Chicken & Grape)\n- A historical reference to the synergy between chicken and grape, implied from the text snippet available.\n\n### Poulet & Rose (Chicken & Rose)\n- Popular in medieval cuisine, it involves cooking chicken with rose petals or water. There is a mention of Laura Esquivel's novel \"Como agua para chocolate\", which suggests a fictional reference of chicken cooked in rose petal sauce. Brillat-Savarin disapproved using roses for food, and the text describes it as an exquisite but rare dish.\n\n### Poulet & Safran (Chicken & Saffron)\n- This section mentions the use of saffron along with chicken but the details are not visible due to the cut-off text.\n\n### Poulet & Sauge (Chicken & Sage)\n- Sage, often paired with onion, enhances the taste of the chicken, making it more robust and flavorful. It's often used during the Elizabethan era through the Second World War. There's a comparison of chicken to gamey victuals like duck or swan.\n\n### Poulet & Thym (Chicken & Thyme)\n- Thyme is used to season the chicken while roasting, enhancing the flavor by stuffing it under the skin. The recipe suggests marinating the chicken in seawater with thyme and then saißering in goose fat for preserved cooking.\n\n### Poulet & Tomate (Chicken & Tomato)\n- Discusses a contemporary or perhaps simplified approach to chicken with tomatoes, poking at the notion of it being less exciting due to commonplace pairings like chicken in ketchup or dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets. It also mentions a recipe of \"tikka masala\" which symbolizes a hunter’s dish, celebrating the infusion of chicken with bold spices and tomato.\n\nEach section not only provides culinary insights but encapsulates cultural, historical, and sometimes literary references contributing to a diverse culinary narrative around chicken."

    "contenu": "```markdown\n# Glossary of Wine Terms\n\n- **BENTONITE**: A type of light clay, usually from the United States or Africa, mixed into wine to clarify it by removing tiny suspended protein molecules that can cause a hazy appearance (see FINING). As the bentonite settles, it absorbs and carries the particles suspended in the wine along with it to the bottom of the vessel. The clear wine is then racked off the settled material.\n\n- **BIG**: A descriptive term used for FULL-BODIED, robust wines that are usually high in ALCOHOL.\n\n- **BIODYNAMIC VITICULTURE**: See box, page 34 in the chapter Where It All Begins.\n\n- **BITTER**: A harsh flavor in wine, often derived from stems and seeds that have been carelessly or inadvertently crushed along with the grapes. Bitterness can also be caused by unripe grapes or unripe TANNIN. In certain big red wines, a slight bitterness is considered a positive nuance, just as it would be in a good espresso.\n\n- **BLEND**: To combine two or more lots of wine in hopes of enhancing flavor, BALANCE, and/or complexity. Often these are wines from different grape varieties (cabernet sauvignon and merlot, for example). However, blends may also be made up of wines that come from grapes grown in different soil or microclimates, wines that come from vines of different ages, wines from different CLONES, or wines made by different winemaking methods (some aged in one kind of oak, some in another, for instance). Virtually all Bordeaux wines and Champagnes are blends, as are wines from France’s southern Rhône Valley and numerous other wines from elsewhere around the world.\n\n- **BODY**: The perceived weight of a wine in your mouth. The perception is dependent on ALCOHOL—the higher the alcohol content, the more FULL-BODIED the wine. As a point of reference, consider the relative weights of skim milk, whole milk, and half-and-half. Light-bodied wines feel like skim milk, medium-bodied ones like whole milk, and full-bodied ones like half-and-half.\n\n- **BOOZE**: Once spelled “bouse,” the term comes from a medieval Dutch word, büsen, meaning “to drink to excess.”\n\n- **BOTRYTIS CINEREA**: A beneficial fungus, also known as noble rot, which is necessary to produce many of the world’s great sweet wines, including Sauternes. In certain years, when the degree of humidity is just right, Botrytis cinerea will attack grapes, covering them with a gray mold. The mold lives by penetrating the grapes’ skins and using up the available water in the juice. This concentrates the sugar, flavor, and ACID so that a COMPLEX wine of exceptional sweetness can be made. Botrytis is unique in that, unlike other molds, it produces flavors that harmonize with the flavors of particular grapes.\n\n- **BOTRYTIZED**: Affected by BOTRYTIS CINEREA.\n\n- **BOTTLE**: Initially, the amount glass bottles held was not consistent. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth century, bottles held anywhere from 16 to 52 ounces. Today a standard wine bottle holds 25.36 ounces (750 milliliters). Restaurants generally pour five to six glasses of wine from a single bottle.\n\n- **BOTTLE AGING**: The process of allowing a wine to rest for a considerable period of time (usually years) in a bottle. Wines that have been bottle aged taste more mature, and their flavors can become so integrated that it's no longer easy to identify such specific fruit flavors as lemon, raspberry, or cherry. Bottle aging adds to the complexity of a wine (see AGING).\n\n- **BOTTLE SICKNESS**: A temporary condition that occurs following the bottling process, during which wine is exposed to large amounts of oxygen as it is transferred from barrels or tanks to bottles. A wine with bottle sickness, sometimes called bottle shock, can temporarily taste FLAT, dull, or out of BALANCE. The condition usually goes away in a few weeks, occasionally after months.\n\n- **BOUQUET**: Technically, bouquet refers specifically to the aspects of a wine’s scent derived from BOTTLE AGING (see AROMA).\n\n- **BRIARY**: A term used to describe a briar patch or barklike taste in a wine. Often briary wines have a slightly scratchy texture, rather than being soft and round.\n\n- **BRILLIANT**: When applied to a wine’s color, it means the wine is absolutely clear.\n\n- **BRIX**: A measure of the sugar content of grapes before they are harvested. Used to estimate the ALCOHOL content of the resulting wine.\n\n- **BRUT**: French term indicating a Champagne or sparkling wine that is dry to very dry, with less than 1.5 g/L of residual sugar.\n```"

Because we typically eat three times a day, 365 days a year, we enjoy novelty, such as a twist on the traditional construct of a dish. Increasingly, since the 1980s and the advent of “tall” food, chefs have played with the presentation of their ingredients. Since the 1990s, the advent of avant-garde cuisine and so-called molecular gastronomy has seen chefs experiment more and more with both the chemical composition and presentation of dishes as well."
