    "contenu": "The document titled \"CLONES\" discusses the concept of grapevine clones in the context of winemaking. Here is a structured summary of its contents:\n\n### Title\n**CLONES**\n\n### Main Points\n1. **Variety in Grape Flavors**\n   - Different grape varieties like Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc have distinct tastes. However, even a single grape variety comprises numerous subtypes due to genetic mutations over time, which are identified as clones.\n   \n2. **Genetic Instability of Grapevines**\n   - Grapevines are not genetically stable and spontaneously mutate, creating a collection of subtypes known as clones. Each clone originates from a mother vine and is genetically identical to it. The propagation is typically through cuttings rather than seeds.\n   \n3. **Simplistic Example of Grapevine Clones**\n   - A hypothetical example involving two vineyards owned by Adam and Eve, and their son Abel, illustrates how a better-quality grapevine clone might be selected. Abel prefers his mother's vineyard and starts his own vineyard with cuttings from one of the superior grapevines from his mother’s vineyard, naming it “Eve’s Clone” of Pinot Noir.\n\n4. **Impact of Clones on Wine Quality**\n   - Clones can greatly influence the smell, taste, and overall quality of wine. Different clones of the same variety can produce wines with varying intensities of flavor, aromas, and tasting notes ranging from fruity to earthy.\n   - The choice of clone(s) by a producer significantly affects the wine’s ultimate flavor profile and character.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe document lays out how clones are a crucial factor in the diversity and quality of wines, emphasizing that grape varieties are more complex than they might seem due to the existence of these genetic variations."

    "contenu": "# The Four Basic Food Molecules\n\n## Introduction to Fat Behaviors\n\n- **Behavior in Baking**: Fat behavior in baking such as in butter is crucial for making pastries and cakes, aiding in their spreadability at room temperature.\n  \n- **Transformation of Fats**: Melted fats change from a liquid to a gas only under extremely high temperatures (from 500° to 750°F/260–400°C). This point is significantly above water’s boiling point due to the large molecular size of fats.\n\n## The Smoke Point of Fats\n- **Decomposition Point**: Fats begin to decompose at temperatures well below their boiling points and may spontaneously ignite when in contact with the stove’s gas flame.\n- **Maximum Temperature Limits**: The characteristic temperature where a fat breaks down into visible products is called the smoke point, where the fat also releases smoky fumes and various undesirable compounds.\n\n- **Impact of Free Fatty Acid Content**: The smoke point depends on the initial free fatty acid content of the fat; lower free fatty acid levels generally result in a higher and more stable smoke point.\n- **Example Refined Levels**: Refined vegetable oils have higher smoking points compared to unrefined ones or animal fats. Fresh refined vegetable oils begin to smoke around 410°F/230°C, whereas animal fats around 375°F/190°C.\n- **Usage Tip for Deep Frying**: The rate of fat breaking down during deep frying can be reduced by using a taller, narrow pan, thus minimizing the surface area of contact between the fat and the air.\n\n## Emulsifiers in Fats\n- **Type of Molecules**: Key emulsifiers in fat include **Phospholipids, Lecithin, Monoglycerides**.\n- **Functionality**: These molecules act as emulsifiers mixing oil and water components resulting in stable mixtures found in products like mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.\n- **Structure and Behavior**: Lecithin, a predominant phospholipid, comprises a glycerol frame and constituents that give it a dual nature aiding in the emulsification process. The molecules have hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, stabilizing emulsions.\n  \n- **Applications of Emulsifiers**: These \"surface-active\" molecules not only aid in emulsion but are also used extensively to enhance shelf life by preventing staling in baked products through interaction with starch molecules."

Below are the structured contents extracted and outlined according to the key topics covered in the document:\n\n### Barley Malt\n- **Form of Consumption**: The most common form in which barley is consumed is as **malt**.\n- **Uses**: Barley malt is primarily used in beers, some distilled liquors, and as a minor ingredient in baked goods.\n- **Preparation Process**: Malt is made from barley grains that are moistened and allowed to germinate. The process makes the grains sweet with sugars.\n- **Properties**: The detailed properties and qualities of barley malt are discussed on page 679 and 743 of the book.\n\n### Rye\n- **Origin**: Rye originated in southwest Asia, migrating with domesticated wheat and barley.\n- **Growth Conditions**: Rye thrives in cold climates like that around the Baltic Sea from around 2000 BCE. It grows well in poor, acidic and cool soils.\n- **Historical Importance**: It was a crucial bread grain for the poor in northern Europe and is still popular in regions like Poland and Germany.\n- **Height Adaptability**: Rye can grow as high as 12,000 feet.\n- **Production History**: In Germany, rye production historically exceeded wheat production for the first time in 1957.\n- **Chemical Composition**: Contains up to 70% of its weight in carbohydrates named pentosans, now referred to as arabinoxylans, which can absorb water and swell.\n\n### Rye and LSD\n- **Medical Implications**: Rye can indirectly influence modern medicine and pharmacology due to its suitability for the growth of ergot fungi (*Claviceps purpurea*), which has historical significance in medicine.\n- **Impact of Ergot**: Ergot contamination in rye was historically linked to ergotism or Saint Anthony’s Fire, causing symptoms like gangrene and mental derangement through the Middle Ages and up until the 20th century.\n- **Derivatives of Ergot**: Chemists in the early 20th century isolated several alkaloids from ergot, which vary from stimulating the uterus to causing hallucinations and constricting blood vessels.\n- **Significant Discovery**: In 1943, Albert Hofmann isolated LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), an important pharmaceutical derivative of ergot, which became widely recognized in the 1960s.\n\nThese sections detail the significant aspects of barley and rye as food sources, their agricultural preferences, historical importance, and their indirect influence on medical pharmacology through secondary compounds like LSD."

    "contenu": "The given document contains an informative discussion on the processing of chocolate, focusing on the later stages involving the cooling and solidifying processes as well as texture modifications by addition of lecithin. Below is a structured summary of the main points of the document:\n\n- **Addition of Lecithin:** Lecithin is added towards the end of the chocolate mass preparation process to provide sufficient lubrication for the mixture. It helps the mixture remain creamy and smooth by coating sugar particles and easing interaction with cocoa butter. Typically, lecithin constitutes 0.3-0.5% of the chocolate's weight.\n\n- **Cooling and Solidifying:** After the conching process, where chocolate paste is refined, dark chocolate remains a warm fluid mass composed of cocoa butter with suspended cocoa beans and sugar particles. The document notes that milk chocolate also follows a similar cooling process but likely involves additional elements from milk.\n\n- **Final Manufacturing Steps:** The text discusses the transition from fluid chocolate to solid bars which involves cooling the liquid chocolate, portioning it into molds, and allowing it to reach room temperature to solidify. This provides the chocolate with its final form and texture, featuring a glossy, snappy exterior.\n\n- **Tempering:** There’s a brief mention of tempering where manufactured chocolate is often melted and reshaped or coated onto other foods. This process involves repeated heating and cooling to maintain chocolate's desirable qualities.\n\nLastly, the displayed images below the text compare the visual compositions of dark and milk chocolates at the molecular level:\n- **Left Image (Dark Chocolate):** Consists of cacao-bean particles and sugar crystals embedded in cocoa butter.\n- **Right Image (Milk Chocolate):** Shows a higher proportion of milk proteins and sugars with fewer cacao-bean particles.\n\nThis document likely serves as an educational piece explaining the finer aspects of chocolate production, particularly post-conching processes that affect texture and shape. It emphasizes the technical considerations necessary to achieve high-quality chocolate products."

    "contenu": "The document is structured around descriptions of dishes involving vegetables, mainly focusing on broccolis and artichokes, expressed in a poetic and narrative style. Here’s a breakdown of the text content separated into sections:\n\n---\n\n### Broccoli & Noix (Broccoli & Nuts)\n- **Broccoli & Piment**: Broccoli takes on a richer and sweeter flavor when roasted. Smoked or fresh hot pepper is a perfect companion. This section also mentions Anchovies & Broccoli.\n- **Broccoli & Porc**: No additional information provided about this combination in this excerpt, just a reference to see \"Porc & Broccoli\".\n\n### Artichaut (Artichoke)\n1. **Origin and Flavor Description**: \n   - Artichokes come from a humble origin, as the budded flower of a thistle, and are praised for their complex and fantastic flavor. They contain a phenolic compound that temporarily dulls sweet receptors, enhancing a sweet taste in any food item consumed after an artichoke.\n   - A contrast in reaction by the palate to other tastes—for example, drinking wine after consuming artichokes—can drastically change the perceived flavor, often making the wine taste sweeter.\n\n2. **Artichaut & Agneau (Artichoke & Lamb)**:\n   - Describes the combination of artichokes and lamb as a sophisticated pairing, which could be a topic of refined conversation. Artichokes prepared with anchovy bottoms served in a velvety broth and mushrooms reflect a dense, elongated texture, complementing the lamb's flavor especially when seasoned with seasonal herbs.\n\n3. **Artichaut & Citron (Artichoke & Lemon)**:\n   - Suggests an adventurous usage of artichokes during Easter in Rome, hinting at purchasing a packet of \"carciofi alla giudia\" – a special artichoke dish. It recommends enjoying artichokes cut into quarters and fried with slices of lemon, enhancing their flavors especially when soaked and rinsed in water to reduce bitterness.\n\nEach of these sections not only describes the flavors and the combinations but indulges in a narrative that intertwines cultural and sensorial experiences, suggesting a deep appreciation and almost romantic regard for the ingredients and dishes."

It explains that while the English language lacks a specific term for fermented vegetables as other languages do, such as German and Korean, it is incorrect to refer them merely as \"pickled\" because pickling involves preservation by acidity and modern pickling usually incorporates vinegar rather than fermentation processes.\n\nIt highlights that before the 1940s, fermentation was a primary means of preserving cucumbers, which shifted after the introduction of direct acidification and pasteurization methods. The author, Fred Breidt of the USDA, is cited to support this historical note.\n\nFurther, the document goes on to describe the author's personal approach to vegetable fermentation, depicting it as an untraditional and experimental method rather than strictly following German sauerkraut or Korean kimchi traditions. The text outlines the general steps taken by the author when fermenting vegetables:\n1. **Chop or grate vegetables.**\n2. **Lightly salt the chopped veggies** (adding more as necessary to taste), and either pound or squeeze them until moist, or alternatively, soak the veggies in a brine solution for a few hours.\n3. **Pack the vegetables** into a jar or another vessel tightly.\n\nThis method reflects an adaptable and personalized approach to fermentation, influenced by but not bound to traditional recipes or methods."

    "contenu": "---\n\n# In her excellent cookbook *Growing Up in a Korean Kitchen*, Hi Soo Shin Hepinstall describes some of that variety:\n\nKorean kitchens create more than one hundred kinds of kimchi, using everything from cabbage to watermelon skin and even pumpkin blossoms in summer. Each family's kimchi has its own unique flavor, but the basic process is to salt the vegetable, firming it up by extracting its liquid, locking in the original flavor. A mixture of spices is then introduced and the vegetable is fermented, creating its distinctive character. The most important spices are fresh and powdered hot red peppers, which give the kimchi its biting zest and help seal in its freshness, and crushed garlic and green onions, which enhance its flavor and help to sterilize it. Additional flavor-builders may include ginger, fruits, nuts, and seafood such as salted shrimp and anchovies, fresh oysters, pollack, yellow corvina, skate, and live baby shrimp, or even octopus and squid. Green seaweed, chŏnggak, may be added to help retain freshness; in the mountainous region of the northern provinces, where seafood is not available, beef broth is used instead.^[18]\n\n# In *Saveur*, Mei Chin waxes:\n\nI have tasted subtly flavored kimchis made from mushrooms or burdock root, light and crunchy ones made with soybean sprouts, meaty ones with tender chunks of pumpkin, and luxurious ones made with young octopus. Kimchi can be mild, like tongchimi, or water kimchi, a combination of ingredients like cabbage, Asian pear, pine nuts, whole chiles, and pomegranate seeds floating in a tangy brine. It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment, as with geotjeoli, or “salad,” kimchi, which consists of raw leaves of cabbage dressed with kimchi fixings, a kind of coleslaw that heats the belly as it cools the throat. In all of these forms, kimchi is curiously refreshing, not just because of its heat, which shoots straight to the brain, but also because it effervesces on the tongue. Kimchi serves the same purpose in a Korean meal that palate cleansers serve in a Western one: when you are tired of eating, you take a bite of it, your eyes and mouth water, and you have the energy to begin eating again.^[19]\n\n---"

    "contenu": "### The Basic Structure of Doughs, Batters, and Their Products\n\n**Kneading and Gluten Structure:**\n- Kneading aligns gluten proteins in dough, which initially forms kinks along their lengths.\n- Stretching the dough straightens out these kinks and loops.\n- Once stretching stops and pressure is relieved, gluten molecules revert to a more coiled, spring-like structure that stores energy.\n- Upon relieving this stretching, the dough \"creeps\" back towards its original compact form.\n\n**Gluten Relaxation:**\n- Over time, the elasticity of wheat flour dough relaxes, known as \"gluten relaxation.\"\n- In well-developed dough, gluten proteins align and form many weak bonds, making the dough hold its shape firmly when stretched.\n- As these bonds are inherently weak, the physical tension can cause them to break, leading the dough to slowly relax from a taut ball shape to a flatter, more malleable mass.\n\n**Controlling Gluten Strength:**\n- Gluten strength is crucial in different baking environments and is controlled through various tactics:\n  - **Flour Type:** High-protein flours lead to stronger gluten, beneficial for bread but may produce undesirable toughness in items like pastries.\n  - **Oxidizing Agents:** These substances in flour can promote more linkage between glutenin molecules, thus enhancing dough strength.\n  - **Water Content:** Determines how concentrated the gluten proteins are and influences how well they can bond.\n\n### Food Words: Gluten\n\n- Originating from the Latin word \"gluten,\" meaning glue, gluten was first identified by the Jesuit scholar Francesco Maria Grimaldi.\n- The term \"gluten\" accounts for the sticky substance in durum semolina dough, notable in the creation of pasta.\n- Giambattista Beccari further explored gluten in 1745, noting its similarity to proteins typically found in animals.\n\n---\n\nThis structured content encapsulates the main topics discussed in the document regarding the properties and handling of gluten in dough preparation, as well as a brief history of gluten itself."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content presented:\n\n---\n\n### MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\n**1. Historical Migration and Dairy Use:**\n   - Early settlers from the Caucasian steppes moved to vast areas of Eurasia around 3000 BCE, expanding the usage of milk and butter.\n   - Mediterranean and Middle East populations relied on olive oil rather than butter but still used milk and cheese prominently in their diets and cultures.\n   - The Old Testament also references milk and cheese symbolically in relation to creation.\n\n**2. Modern Perception of Milk:**\n   - In modern times, milk has been transformed from a precious resource to an everyday commodity.\n   - Despite past concerns over fat content, there is now a more balanced view of milk in diets.\n   - Traditional dairy products remain appreciated, reflecting a shift from mass-produced items to more valued dietary variants.\n   - A sip of milk or scoop of ice cream is metaphoric to youthful energy, while cheese signifies maturity and possibility.\n\n**Subsection: MAMMALS AND MILK**\n\n### THE EVOLUTION OF MILK\n\n**1. Milk Developmental Reasons:**\n   - Milk likely originated around 300 million years ago as a protective and nourishing skin secretion for the young of mammals, incubated on the mother's skin.\n   - It evolved to provide vital nutrients immediately after birth, aiding the survival and growth of mammalian offspring.\n   - Milk facilitates continued physical development and maturation after birth, especially helping brain development in human species.\n\n**2. Nutritional and Developmental Benefits:**\n   - Milk offers nutritionally rich, easily digestible, and ideally formulated food that supports growth beyond fetal stages.\n   - It has particularly contributed to the development of the large brain in humans.\n\n### MILK AND BUTTER: PRIMAL FLUIDS\n\n**1. Cultural and Religious Aspects:**\n   - In the *Rg Veda*, it is noted that many of society's elements, both natural and social, were purportedly born from a primal sacrifice using butter.\n   - Biblical references also highlight milk as symbolizing prosperity and divine provision, such as God promising a land of milk and honey to Moses.\n\n**2. Symbolic References in Literature:**\n   - Job's dialogue with God in the Old Testament using milk as a metaphor for transformation and nurturing (\"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?\").\n\n---\n\nThis document provides a multi-faceted look at the cultural, evolutionary, and symbolic significance of milk and dairy products across different epochs and societies."

    "contenu": "The document primarily discusses the advantages and implications of mechanical versus manual harvesting in vineyards, the relationship between yield quantity and quality of wines, and the nuanced factors influencing vineyard assessments.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Mechanical Harvesting Advantages:**\n   - Can operate 24 hours a day.\n   - Capable of picking up to 300 tons of grapes in an eight-hour day.\n   - More cost-effective and beneficial in regions with limited labor, such as Australia.\n   - Maintains speed and efficiency, particularly advantageous before inclement weather.\n\n2. **Manual vs Mechanical Harvesting:**\n   - Manual harvesting better preserves the fruit's freshness in warmer climates due to cool nighttime work.\n   - Initial costs for mechanical harvesters are high but offer long-term savings.\n\n3. **Quantity vs Quality of Yield:**\n   - Common belief that more densely grown grapes might yield more intensely flavored wines.\n   - However, counterarguments suggest neglecting high-density yields may discard quality produced by nature's and human efforts combined.\n   - Examples include varying yield strategies in places like Napa Valley and Champagne region, emphasizing that there isn't a perfect linear correlation between the quantity of yield and wine flavor intensity.\n\n4. **Modern Vineyard Assessment:**\n   - Shift from measuring \"tons per acre\" to more detailed assessments based on individual vines conditions such as cluster count, berry size, and vine strength.\n   - Importance of considering factors like vine age, vineyard's terroir, stress factors, and grape types—all of which influence the quality derived from any given yield.\n   - Every vineyard has a unique balance point; excessive yield can harm the quality of wine.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document underscores the complexity of vineyard management and the sophisticated balance required between yield management and quality control. The evolving practices in vineyard assessment reflect a deeper understanding of how various elements contribute to the final product's quality."

    "contenu": "### Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\nRoussillon, where it is often blended with varieties such as Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan and Cinsault. The wines may vary in style depending on the blend of grapes and the vineyard climate but most tend to have a spicy, perfumed character reminiscent of the local herbs.\n\nOutside Europe, the highest-quality Grenache is probably produced in Australia, particularly in the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. These wines used to be produced in intensely concentrated, full-bodied styles with high levels of alcohol. Now, they are made with more restraint. Old bush vines yield low volumes of highly concentrated grapes, giving robust, ripe wines with intense flavors of red berries and peppery spice.\n\nGrenache tends to be destemmed and crushed on arrival at the winery. Pre-fermentation maceration is common, promoting the extraction of flavour and colour before alcohol levels rise in fermentation. Some producers choose to retain a proportion of whole bunches to enhance the ripe red fruit flavours of this grape.\n\nFermentation is usually conducted in open top fermenters, often made from stainless steel or cement, though some producers may choose old oak. Gentle cap management techniques, such as punching down, are used on premium wines to produce wines with more finesse. Post-fermentation maceration may be carried out if the winemaker wants to enhance the tannic structure of the wine. However, usually Grenache will be drained of the skins at the end of fermentation.\n\nGrenache is usually matured in large vessels such as foudres made from old oak, as the toasty notes from new oak can overwhelm Grenache’s fruit flavors. Grenache is rarely made as a varietal wine and more usually blended with other varieties. In hot climates it can be jammy and high in alcohol and therefore grape varieties that are even more tolerant of heat, such as Carignan and Mourvèdre, can lend fresh fruit flavors as well as greater tannin and colour to the blend."

Message from Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page:\n   - The Flavor Bible is described as the first book with Karen’s name listed first on the cover, acknowledging her primary role as the conceptualizer and writer. Karen had suggested this arrangement before their first book in 1995 to list their names alphabetically out of publishing convenience. This tradition continued for other books due to the ease of alphabetizing on bookstore shelves. Dornenburg expresses his happiness about Karen being properly credited as the primary force behind their collaborative work.\n\nThis document celebrates the professional and personal collaboration between the two authors, emphasizing the significant contribution and leadership of Karen Page in their work."

(For that evocative term, I thank super-chef Mark Miller, who first mentioned it to me in the mid-2000s.) We’ve already addressed *what* to look for in wine; in this section, we’ll deal with *how* to do that.\n\nTo begin, suppose you were asked to write a ten-word description of a wine you drank three nights ago. Could you? Unfortunately, it is possible (easy, in fact) to go for years drinking wine without tasting it in a way that helps you understand and remember it. Most of us—even those of us who are committed food and wine lovers—don’t really taste with conscious intent, nor do we take time to concentrate on what we smell. Tasting and smelling are often virtually mindless tasks. Yet, without sensory focus and without a systematic method of smelling and tasting, it’s just about impossible to develop a taste memory and, ultimately, impossible to understand anything significant about wine.\n\nMost experts did not begin to develop sensory focus as soon as they started drinking wine. Years of drinking wine—however enjoyable—do not automatically lead to an increase in knowledge, or gratification. To gain expertise and—even more significantly—to heighten the pleasure and impact of what you drink, you must learn to be a deliberate taster. Moreover, wine expertise takes (remember those piano lessons?) practice.\n\n**Caption Under Image:** Guests compare wines at one of my seminars at the Napa Valley Reserve.\n\nHow much practice? Here I have to thank my fellow wine writer Matt Kramer, who reveals the research of cognitive psychologist Daniel Levitin, who runs the Laboratory for Music Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. According to Levitin, it takes a minimum of ten thousand hours of practice (equivalent to three hours a day for ten years) to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a professional."

Here is a structured presentation of its content:\n\n### Taste as Narrative\n\n**Key Points:**\n- A recipe is more than a combination of ingredients and techniques; it includes a narrative element similar to a story with a beginning, middle, and end.\n- The narrative approach captures the sequence from the initial list of ingredients through to the final aftertaste, likening the process to enjoying a song rather than just reading its sheet music.\n- This narrative method aims to enhance both the making and understanding of the recipe, as well as an appreciation of various flavors and sensations experienced throughout the tasting process.\n- Specifically, the documented method involves detailing every taste experience from start to finish, ensuring no part of the tasting experience is overlooked, including the aftertaste.\n- It's noted that individual sensitivity to tastes may vary (e.g., salt vs. floral aromas), but generally, the sequence of flavor experiences will follow a recognizable pattern.\n- The narrative approach has not only enriched the authors’ own understanding and enjoyment of their recipes but has also deepened their appreciation for other chefs’ works and improved their culinary creativity.\n\n**Additional Elements:**\n- Example given: A simple recipe was provided as an example to demonstrate how a taste narrative accompanies a recipe, but the specific details of the recipe and narrative are not included in this excerpt.\n\nThis document underscores the importance of seeing cooking and tasting not just as a functional process, but as an experiential one that involves storytelling elements."

Whole fish and fillets have varying thicknesses which results in uneven cooking. Fish types like bluefish, tuna, swordfish, and shark contain dense flesh with high protein but lower fat content, making it easy to overcook the thinner areas while trying to cook the thicker sections.\n- **Workarounds for Uneven Cooking**:\n  - Use the gentlest possible heat.\n  - Oven baking and poaching are recommended low-temperature methods.\n  - After an initial high-temperature treatment, lower it to brown/sterilize the surfaces.\n  - Compensate for uneven thickness by cutting slashes in the thick areas every 1-2 cm.\n\n#### Monitoring Fish Doneness\n- Check fish early and often using timers, experience, and internal temperature measurements. Insert a thermometer, peek inside with a small incision, or use a skewer/ toothpick to check if the fish is translucent, if the connective tissue has dissolved, or if there’s resistance from coagulated muscle fibers.\n\n#### Special Cooking Concerns for Mushy Fish\n- **Why Fish Can Become Mushy**: In certain fish like Atlantic salmon, slow cooking can lead to mushiness caused by protein-digesting enzymes active at around 130-140°F/55-60°C. These enzymes break down muscle cells into energy, increasing as the temperature rises.\n- **Prevention**: Fish prone to becoming mushy such as salmon are best cooked quickly to a high temperature to kill the enzymes, ideally at 160°F/70°C or lower but served immediately after.\n\n#### Preparations for Cooking\n- **Cleaning and Cutting**: In U.S. markets, fish are often sold precleaned and precut."
