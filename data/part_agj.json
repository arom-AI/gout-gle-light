Each tool is discussed with its intended purpose, usage, and historical context.\n\n---\n\n### LEWIS BAGS {for making crushed ice}\n\n**Use Location:** Death & Co (speaking generally about its implementation, not necessarily a precise location) \n\n**Purpose:** Used to make crushed ice at home\n\n**Description:** \nLewis Bags are preferred for crushing ice as compared to hand-cranked ice crushers. The process involves filling the bag with ice and using a wooden mallet, muddler, or small saucepan to crush the ice. The canvas of the Lewis Bag absorbs any water that melts from the ice during the crushing process.\n\n**Machine Reference:**\nCommercial Scotsman machine used for supplying pellet ice.\n\n### TAP-ICERS {for cracking ice}\n\n**Historical Popularity:** Mid-twentieth century\n\n**Purpose:** Used to crack ice cubes\n\n**Description:**\nA Tap-Icer is a long, flexible plastic wand with a smooth steel disk on the end, specifically designed for cracking ice cubes. Some bartenders may use a heavier barspoon for this task, but a Tap-Icer can effectively shatter big ice blocks with a gentle snap of the wrist, thus reducing the effort required during a work shift.\n\n**Alternative Tools:**\nAntique ice crackers are mentioned, typically featuring a metal wand with a spring and a small metal ball on the ice-cracking end. However, these are noted for being less efficient and sometimes dangerous (causing more injuries than cracked ice).\n\n### General Note\n\nBoth tools are highlighted for their specific uses in bar settings, focusing on their functional benefits and drawbacks. The document also indirectly points to the evolution of bar tools and the relevance of practical design considerations in their effectiveness and safety."

    "contenu": "### Science Fact\n\n**Molecular mass (m) is the mass of a given molecule measured in atomic mass units (u) or daltons (Da). The average aroma molecule weighs less than 200 Da – it would take 221 molecules to equal a single gram.**\n\n### What is that sweet scent?\n\nAt 342 daltons, sugar molecules (sucrose) are too heavy for us to register through orthonasal detection, so when we say that something smells sweet, we are actually referring to the small-taste association of flavors like vanilla and cinnamon, familiar from desserts with a high sugar content. The term ‘sweet’ is also often applied to fruity scents and caramellic flavors, but these associations are subjective because they are shaped by our cultural or personal experiences. For instance, in France, where desserts are often flavored with vanilla, incorporating the spice into a recipe may cause a dish to be perceived as sweeter than it is. In Vietnam, however, fresh lemon juice is commonly added to sweeten drinks, so consumers may form their own associations between lemons and sweetness.\n\n### Trigeminal Sensations\n\n**Apart from the five basic tastes, we experience other pleasurable—and sometimes painful—sensations when we eat.** Temperature, texture, pain, and cooling are just some of the trigeminal sensations that enhance our olfactory and gustatory experiences. Certain chemical compounds stimulate the trigeminal nerve, which sends signals to the brain. For example, Sichuan peppercorns contain hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, which causes a tingly, numbing sensation known as paresthesia. Spilanthol is responsible for the analgesic effect of Sichuan buttons – the edible flowers of the pepper plant – and several other plant varieties. Capsaicin gives chili peppers their fiery burn, and menthol leaves behind its minty cooling effect. The fizz in carbonated soft drinks comes from citric acid.\n\n**Texture also plays a crucial role in our enjoyment of food:** you might reflexively spit out a stale potato crisp or cereal that has gone soggy. But mouthfeel conveys more than just the physical state and structure of our food; it also informs our oral somatosensory system about everything from touch and temperature to pain, pressure and more.\n\n**Specialized receptors located on the tongue and in the epithelial layer of the mouth send signals to the brain about the size, shape and texture of whatever we eat or drink.** We have many sensory receptors clustered towards the front of the tongue and in the mouth where another slice on our bodies; these receptors alert us immediately about whether something tastes pleasant or off, evidential of yet another evolutionarily self-defense mechanism that is critical to our survival.\n\n### Taste happens in the brain\n\n**Unlike olfaction, which is synthetic, our perception of taste is analytical,** meaning that the individual tastes can be isolated in the brain. Charles S Zuker, a professor of biochemistry, molecular biophysics and neuroscience at Columbia University in New York, recently proved that taste perception occurs not on the tongue, but in the brain where the neurons responsible for different tastes are triggered. According to Dr Zuker, 'Dedicated taste receptors in the tongue detect sweet or bitter and so on, but it’s the brain that affords meaning to these chemicals.'\n\n### Are you a supertaster?\n\n**About 25 percent of the population can be considered supertasters.** They are hypersensitive to taste, not flavours, so to them, sweet, sour, and salty foods have a heightened intensity, while some vegetables and bitter drinks like coffee and beer are positively unbearable.\n\nWhether you qualify as a supertaster or not is determined by the number of fungiform papillae on your tongue. The average person has about 15–35 papillae in an area 6mm (¼in) in diameter, whereas supertasters may have as many as 60. Non-tasters, who make up another 25 per cent of the population, have fewer than 15 papillae within the same area."

Here's the structured information from the document titled \"Phylloxera — The Devastation Returns.\"\n\n### Document Title:\n**Phylloxera — The Devastation Returns**\n\n### Document Content:\n\n#### Section 1: Introduction\n- **Major Event:** The most shocking event in the modern history of California winemaking occurred in Napa Valley in the mid-1980s due to Phylloxera. \n- **Impact:** This insect devastated grapevines planted on AXR1 rootstock, causing significant replanting and economic costs.\n- **Outcome:** By the 1990s, the devastation required a complete replanting which cost about $3 billion. This event led to the selection and planting of grape varieties better suited to their vineyard sites, transforming Napa Valley into a region known for superb cabernet sauvignon.\n\n#### Section 2: Historical Note\n- **Fact:** The name California was first used in Spanish documents in 1542, deriving from a fabled island in the novel *The Exploits of Esplandián*.\n\n#### Section 3: Prohibition and Its Effects\n- **Prohibition Start:** Began in January 1920.\n- **Prohibition End:** Ended in December 1933.\n- **Aftermath:** By the end of Prohibition, only 140 wineries remained from over a thousand, many of which survived by making sacramental wines.\n\n#### Section 4: Recovery and Triumph\n- **Recovery Period:** Took until the late 1960s and early 1970s for the winemaking industry in California to regain momentum.\n- **Development:** By the 1980s, California had become one of the most advanced and accomplished wine regions in the world.\n- **Key Events:**\n  - 1966: The best-selling California wines were cheap and made from widely grown grapes like Carignane or Thompson seedless.\n  - 1976: California wines achieved international recognition at the Judgment of Paris, with Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars' cabernet sauvignon and Chateau Montelena's chardonnay winning top honors against prestigious French wines.\n\n#### Section 5: Conclusion\n- **Judgment of Paris Details:** The tasting disproved the expected superiority of French wines, showcasing the quality and appeal of California wines. Despite predictions, the young and fruity California wines were celebrated, challenging the notion that only older French wines were of high quality.\n\n### Summary:\nThe document outlines the significant historical moments of California's wine industry, detailing its trials, recovery, and eventual triumphs on an international stage."

The document emphasizes the visual beauty of these vineyards framed by snow-capped Andean peaks.\n\n- **Winery Modernization and International Ventures:**\n  - Several of Chile's historic and notable wine companies like Cousiño-Macul, Concha y Toro, Canepa, Errázuriz, Santa Rita, Undurraga, and Santa Carolina, have invested substantially in modernizing their wineries. The upgrades mentioned include the acquisition of new equipment and French and American oak barrels.\n  - Highlighted as a vital step for these wineries is the shift towards engaging in international joint ventures.\n  - Specifically mentioned is the partnership in the early 1990s between Chile’s Errázuriz and California’s Robert Mondavi Winery to create Seña, a high-end Bordeaux blend, launched at $55 in 1998.\n  - Additionally, a joint venture between Château Mouton-Rothschild and Concha y Toro led to the release of the Bordeaux-style blend, Almaviva, priced at $70 per bottle.\n\n### Summary:\nThe document provides an overview of the Chilean wine industry's response to globalization and increasing quality demands. It also details the beneficial geographical characteristics provided by the Andes, which significantly influence the conditions for vineyard cultivation, thereby aiding the industry's growth and international reputation."

It describes Dolcetto as an honest, direct, and unpretentious wine variety that is both juicy and grapelike, similar to Zinfandel, and typically enjoyed young.\n\n**Main Characteristics**:\n- **Brightness**: Dolcetto is described as one of the light, bright reds.\n- **Pairing**: It pairs well with both fish and \"white wine\" dishes as well as classic “red wine” meals, being versatile in accompaniment.\n- **Drinkability**: It is highlighted as enjoyable and fun; it's a regular feature in the author’s monthly wine box, indicating frequent personal endorsement.\n\n**Alternative Names**:\n- Ormeasco (Liguria, Italy)\n\n**Styles**:\n- Medium to full-bodied red\n\n**Sometimes Blended With**:\n- Includes varieties such as Barbera, Nebbiolo, Rossese from Italy, and various grapes from the U.S.A.\n\n**Flavor Lexicon**:\n- **Fruit/Vegetable**: Blueberry, cherry, plum, porcini, raspberry\n- **Floral**: Anise, orange blossoms, rose petals\n- **Earth**: Graphite, mineral\n- **Wood**: Coffee\n\n**Similar Wines**:\n- Suggested similar tasting options include rich Beaujolais, fruit-forward Merlot, and easy-drinking Zinfandel.\n\n**Regions Where Grown**:\n- **Internationally**: Australia (Victoria)\n- **Italy**: Regions such as Liguria, Piedmont (specifically areas of Alba, Dogliani, Ovada)\n- **U.S.A.**: Coastal areas including Mendocino County, Napa County, Sonoma County (Dry Creek Valley, Russian River Valley), and others like Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon (southern Oregon, Umpqua Valley), Pennsylvania, Washington (Columbia Valley).\n\n**Cultural Insights**:\n- In Italy, Dolcetto is affectionately known as “little sweet one,” which is the literal meaning of its name in Piedmontese. It’s staple in its homeland of Piedmont but enjoyed widely in northern Italy. Although less sharp than Barbera and more generous in color and fruity flavors, Dolcetto serves as a reliable grape choice for winemakers.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The text presents Dolcetto as a cherished and versatile wine grape, important both in Italy and abroad, suitable for varied culinary pairings and appreciated for its vibrant but complex flavor characteristics.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured breakdown summarizes the key informative points about Dolcetto outlined in the document."

Here is a summarization of the key points:\n\n1. **Overview and Setting**:\n   - The text immerses the reader into a picturesque scene in the Alps where the wine transcends its physical form to provide comfort and reassurance.\n\n2. **Location and Provenance**:\n   - Barolo and Barbaresco wines originate from southeast Piedmont. They are exclusively made from the Nebbiolo grape, a variety bearing deep historical roots and potent aromatics noted for scents reminiscent of tar, roses, licorice, violets, leather, chocolate, prunes, and figs.\n\n3. **Characteristics of the Wines**:\n   - Each wine’s characteristic embodiment is different. Barolo wines are described as robust, austere, and masculine, bursting forth with intense flavor. \n   - Barbaresco, although equally notable, presents a slightly more graceful demeanor yet with considerable depth, often referred to as having 'brooding power'.\n   - Flavors in both wines are powerful and assertively make their presence known, much like a \"stormy ocean wave\".\n\n4. **Production Scale and Geography**:\n   - Barolo wine production is more expansive compared to Barbaresco.\n   - Three villages — Barbaresco itself, Neive, and Treiso — primarily produce Barbaresco. In contrast, Barolo is produced in eleven villages, including the specifically named La Morra, Castiglione Falletto, Monforte d’Alba, and Serralunga d’Alba, indicating a more varied production base which affects its consistency in quality and style.\n\nThis summary distills the essence of the document while focusing on the geographical, sensorial, and contrastive aspects between Barolo and Barbaresco, emphasizing their uniqueness and revered status in the world of wines."

    "contenu": "### RÍAS BAIXAS\n\nWhen the small white wine region of Rías Baixas (RE-ez BUY-shez), in far northwestern Spain, came to prominence in the 1990s, a new era in Spanish white wine history was born. With the exception of Sherry, which is fortified, and cava, which is sparkling, the Spanish wines that have commanded world attention have almost exclusively been red—not white.\n\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, modern technology, including the use of temperature-controlled stainless-steel tanks, could be found in virtually all of the top wineries making white wine in Spain. Quality skyrocketed. Leading the way were the wines of Rías Baixas, a remote wine region poised on the Atlantic just above Portugal, in the southern part of the province of Galicia. Here, white grapes had been grown for centuries. But it wasn’t until the technological revolution that the wines of Rías Baixas began to be considered among the best white wines in Spain.\n\nRías Baixas takes its name from the Galician *rías*, which are sharp, fjordlike estuaries that slice like cobalt swords into the báixas, or lower part of southern Galicia. This is one of the world’s most breathtaking wine regions, and definitely one of the most unusual looking in Spain. It would be easy to think you were in Ireland or Wales—until you take note of the eucalyptus forests that cover the steep hills and deep ravines. Wild scarlet roses grow out of ancient Roman stone walls. Orange trees dance in the breeze. The mountainous air is pristine; the sun is like a scoop of lemon sorbet moving in and out of the thick, coastal clouds. To find vineyards in the middle of this feels as though you’ve just uncovered a secret no one else knows.\n\nThe best Rías Baixas wines are made principally from the white albariño grape. In fact, albariño, not Rías Baixas, is the name by which the wines are commonly known and labeled. This is in complete contrast to other Spanish wine regions, where wines are typically referred to by region (Rioja), not according to the grape planted (tempranillo).\n\nAlbariño has a unique flavor profile. Not as zaftig as chardonnay, nor as minerally as riesling, nor as wild and herbal as sauvignon blanc, its flavors range from zingy citrus-peach to almond-honeysuckle. In texture, albariños are beautifully poised between light creaminess and crisp zestiness. Indeed, because most albariños are neither fermented nor aged in wood, the best of them are as light as gossamer on the palate."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"CEREAL DOUGHS AND BATTERS\" is structured into three main sections, each focusing on specific components and characteristics of doughs and batters used in baking:\n\n1. **General Properties of Cereal Doughs and Batters**\n   - **Fats/Shortening**: The text describes the effects of fats or oils, termed as shortening, on the dough. Shortening is said to \"shorten\" the dough, meaning it interrupts the gluten structure making the final product more tender or flaky. This is particularly observable in pie crusts and puff pastry. Shortening is less evident but still important in cakes and other baked goods.\n   - **Image Description**: Accompanying the text is a close-up image of bread dough. It illustrates how the dense mass of gluten and starch in the dough is divided and tenderized by gas bubbles.\n\n2. **Formation of Doughs/Batters with Gas Bubbles**: \n   - This section explains the role of gas bubbles created when bakers use yeasts or chemical leavenings. The carbon dioxide released from these leavening agents diffuses into and enlarges existing bubbles in the dough or batter, affecting the final texture by making it finer and tenderer.\n\n3. **Dough and Batter Ingredients: Wheat Flours**\n   - The primary focus is on wheat flours, detailing that while other grains and seeds are used in baking, wheat flour is the most conventional choice.\n   - **Kinds of Wheat**: The document specifies Triticum aestivum (most common bread wheat) for its high protein and strong gluten content which is crucial for baking. Additional details about different kinds of wheat and their uses in baking are hinted to be in a supplemental box (referred to as \"see box, p. 527\").\n\nEach section of this document contributes to a holistic understanding of the critical elements and ingredients in the preparation of bakery products, highlighting how the manipulation of ingredients and processes affect the final baked goods."

Below, I have structured the recipe content found in the text:\n\n### Préparer un risotto\n\n**Difficulty Level**: ★★\n\n**Narrative**: \"Moins compliqué qu'on ne croit si on veille à ne pas le surcuire.\"\n\n#### Ingrédients:\n- 75 cl de bouillon de légumes\n- 1 oignon\n- 1 carotte\n- 1 branche de céleri\n- 3 cuillères à soupe d'huile d'olive\n- 250 g de riz à risotto (arborio, carnaroli, vialone nano)\n- 15 cl de vin blanc sec\n- 80 g de beurre froid\n- 60 g de parmesan râpé + pour servir\n- Sel fin, poivre du moulin\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. **Préparation des légumes**:\n   - Pelez et émincez l'oignon, la carotte, et le céleri. \n   - Verse l'oignon, la carotte et le céleri dans une casserole munie d'un couvercle pour éviter l'évaporation. Puis, faites-les revenir quelques instant dans une cocotte ou sauteuse avec 3 cuillères à soupe d'huile d'olive jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient nacrés, laissant enrober d'huile (Images 1 & 2).\n\n2. **Cuisson du riz**:\n   - Ajoutez le riz à la préparation et remuez bien pour bien mélanger l'huile et les légumes.\n\n3. **Déglacer avec du vin**:\n   - Versez le vin blanc et laissez-le s'évaporer complètement en remuant (Image 3).\n\n4. **Ajout de bouillon**:\n   - Ajoutez une louche de bouillon et remuez, répétant le processus jusqu'à ce que le bouillon soit absorbé avant d'ajouter une autre louche.\n\n5. **Vérification de la cuisson**:\n   - Continuez de mélanger jusqu'à ce que le riz soit moelleux mais pas complètement évaporé, ajustez la quantité de bouillon comme nécessaire pour atteindre la consistance désirée (évitez qu’il reste toujours un peu de bouillon avant d'ajouter une nouvelle louche).\n\n6. **Finishing Touches**:\n   - Eteignez le feu, incorporez le beurre froid en morceaux et le parmesan râpé. Mélangez énergiquement pour que l'amidon du riz s'émulsionne avec le beurre et le fromage, créant ainsi le crémeux du risotto (Image 8).\n\n7. **Adjust Seasoning and Serve**:\n   - Goûtez et rectifiez l’assaisonnement avec du sel et du poivre si nécessaire. Servez chaud dans des assiettes creuses.\n\nThe document is laid out with clear headings, a list of ingredients, and a detailed sequence of preparation steps, making it easy to follow the recipe. Each major step is accompanied by sequential images to visually guide the cooking process."

(As of 2013, California had 120 American Viticultural Areas, ranging from tiny to large.) First we’ll explore the familiar regions of Napa Valley, Sonoma County, and Carneros, the region that straddles them. Then we’ll travel more or less north to south, beginning with Mendocino and Lake counties; followed by the Sierra Foothills; followed by the North Central Coast (composed of the Santa Cruz Mountains, Monterey, Chalone, Mt. Harlan, Carmel Valley, and the Santa Lucia Highlands). Then it’s on to Livermore Valley, Paso Robles, and York Mountain, as well as Edna Valley and Arroyo Grande. And, finally, there’s the magnificent South Central Coast wine regions of Santa Barbara County, Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Maria Valley, Sta. Rita Hills, Ballard Canyon, and the fittingly named Happy Canyon."

I season our tartare with mustard, capers, and anchovies, which I am not shy about. You want the texture of the beef to be a counterpoint.\n\n**Source:**\n— MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)\n\n### Michael Lomonaco of Porter House New York on Cooking Steak\n\n**Aging:**\nAging is important because it tenderizes the steak. The aging process breaks down the fibers and dehydrates the steak, concentrating its flavor. A dry-aged steak has a more minerally and sharp edge to it, versus fresh meat that tastes sweeter. It is critical to the flavor and adds to the cost because it takes four weeks of aging to achieve it.\n\n**Seasoning:**\nAll our steaks are seasoned with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper just prior to cooking, which draws out the flavor while they cook. A squeeze of lemon makes a good Tuscan steak taste even better. If you are in Italy and eating “bistecca Fiorentina,” what you are having is a dry-aged porterhouse. The steak is grilled over dried grape vines and served with an drizzle of green olive oil from the first pressing of the new harvest and lemons on the side.\n\n**Cooking:**\nA steak should be cooked rare to medium rare. \"Rare\" is a little greener.\n\n---\n\nThis page efficiently combines tips on steak aging, seasoning, and cooking methods provided by Michael Lomonaco."

I have loved her clarity of thought and distaste for nonsense since we first met. Without her I could not write any sort of book anyone would want to read.\n\nThanks to my editor at W. W. Norton, Maria Guarnaschelli, who invited me to lunch one day three years ago and decided I was going to write a book. I often hear from author friends that old-school editors don’t exist. I now know that they are wrong. I am extremely fortunate to have had such a passionate, involved, and caring advocate to shepherd this book into existence.\n\nThanks to:\n- Nastassia Lopez, for keeping the wheels on the bus.\n- My partners, the inimitable David Chang and Drew Salmon, for believing in Booker and Dax and in me. I am forever grateful.\n- Travis Huggett, for such a fine job on the photography.\n- Mitchell Kohles, for doing a lot of heavy lifting at W. W. Norton.\n- Harold McGee, for the constant inspiration and for his thoughtful review of drafts of this book.\n- James Carpenter, for going through the manuscript with his laser eye for detail.\n- John McGee, Paul Adams, Ariel Johnson, and Don Lee for their input.\n\nAnd thanks to the people who have inspired me and supported me on my decidedly non-linear career path, even when my endeavors seemed far-fetched:\n- My mom and Gerard, my dad, and the whole Addonizio/Arnold clan; Maile, Ridge, and the rest of the Carpenters.\n- Early, Ludwick, Sweeney, and Strauss, who helped foot the bill.\n- Jeffrey Steingarten and Dana Cowin, early supporters who helped me find my place in the food world."

The structured content of the document can be outlined as follows:\n\n---\n\n### BOOZE-WASHING CONTROL\n\n#### Polyphenols\n- **Description**: Identified as chemicals produced by plants, serving as defense mechanisms.\n- **Properties**: Polyphenols are known for their bactericidal, insecticidal, and antitdigestive properties, which deter animal interference.\n- **Examples and Impact**:\n  - Tannins, a type of polyphenol, are highlighted for adding astringency and flavor to products like red wine, cranberry, cassis, and certain types of whiskey.\n  - Polyphenols are linked to the desirable astringency of dark tea.\n\n#### Method of Manipulation\n- **Background**: It is noted that polyphenol oxidases in damaged herb leaves can link small phenolic molecules together into larger, dark-colored polyphenols.\n- **Process**:\n  - The text mentions 'stealing from the winemaker’s playbook', suggesting the adaptation of traditional wine-making techniques.\n  - **Finning**: A process where small quantities of ingredients are added to improve liquor by reducing flavors, turbidity, and other negative characteristics.\n\n#### Principles of Booze Washing\n1. **Protein Binding**\n   - **Agents Involved**: Egg white, blood, gelatin, casein (milk protein), and isinglass (fish gelatin).\n   - **Function**: These proteins bind to impurities in complex ways, stripping tannins and polyphenols, impacting color and flavor.\n  \n2. **Charge**\n   - **Agents**: Kieselsol (carrying negative charge), chitosan (positively charged).\n   - **Mechanism**: These agents work based on electrical charge attractions to target impurities.\n  \n3. **Adsorption**\n   - **General Idea**: The text suggests relevance to the adsorption process but does not delve into specifics within the provided excerpt.\n\n---\n\nThe text is structured to first introduce the concept and importance of polyphenols in the context of liquor production, followed by detailed descriptions of the control processes and mechanisms involved in modifying the effect of polyphenols through various agents and techniques."
