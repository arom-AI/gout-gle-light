The history of civilization is in large part a running commentary on man’s relationship to the land. Soil’s allure is very evident in the world of wine. There is something strangely beautiful about the white chalk of Champagne, the legacy of ancient seabeds and sea fossils; or the jet-black, pitted stones of Santorini in Greece, the relics of a massive volcanic explosion; or the cool, blue-gray slate shards of the Mosel in Germany, remnants of the path of glaciers. Remarkably, vines grow contentedly in all of these.\n\nSoil is undeniably seductive. For thousands of years, it has also been the intellectual assumption behind a wine's character—that is, the notion that a given wine tastes the way it does because of the soil it was born in.\n\nSoil is defined as the naturally occurring loose particles that cover the Earth’s surface. Soil is composed of tiny bits of broken rock, the pore spaces of air between them, water, minerals, and organic matter. There are five main factors in the creation of soil: parent material, climate, topography, biota, and time.\n\nScientists classify soil into six categories. The broadest category are soil orders, and there are twelve in the world (interestingly, in the small Napa Valley, six of the world’s twelve soil orders can be found). From orders, soils are more and more finely categorized. Ultimately, the most specific classification is called a soil series. In the U.S., for one example, there are some seventeen thousand soil series, each marked by a unique set of characteristics based on the arrangement of the soil’s layers, its color, texture, structure, consistency, and chemical and mineralogical properties.\n\nAs far as grapevines are concerned, one of the important factors of any soil is the size of the soil’s particles. Larger particles such as sand (relatively loose, large grains of"

Below I present the structured content extracted from the text:\n\n### PAN-FRYING AND SAUTÉING: CONDUCTION\n- **Description**: Methods that use heat conduction, primarily from hot oil, ranging between 350 and 450°F (175-225°C) which encourage Maillard browning and flavor development.\n- **Roles of Fat/Oil**: \n  - Evens the surface of the food.\n  - Prevents sticking.\n  - Lubricates and adds flavor.\n- **Techniques**:\n  - Avoiding overcooking by preventing the exterior from becoming too dry.\n  - Cooking at high temperatures initially and then reducing the heat.\n  - Using coatings like breadings and batters to insulate the food from direct heat.\n\n### DEEP FRYING: OIL CONVECTION\n- **Difference from Pan Frying**: Uses enough oil to immerse the food completely, employing oil rather than air as the heat transfer medium.\n- **Key Aspect**: The oil is heated well above the boiling point of water which helps dehydrate and brown the food surface efficiently.\n\n### MICROWAVING: MICROWAVE RADIATION\n- **Heat Transfer**: Via electromagnetic radiation, using energy from glowing coals. This form of energy is minimally required yet intensifies the vibration of molecules, especially those that are polar (like water).\n- **Unique Characteristics**:\n  - The coals emit infrared radiation indirectly heating food.\n  - Microwaves directly agitate polar molecules due to their vibration in the alternating electric field.\n  - Nonpolar substances like certain plastics and fats are relatively unaffected by microwaves.\n\n### HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n- **Origins**:\n  - The document mentions historical references to frying dating back to 600 BCE, with the method observed in Leviticus and ancient Roman cooking.\n  - Specific mention of a prescription from the 1st century CE suggesting frying spleen steeped in vinegar then fried in oil.\n- **Cultural Reference**:\n  - By the 14th century, frying as a cooking method was well established enough to be metaphorically mentioned by Chaucer in \"The Wife of Bath\".\n\nThese sections provide a combination of technical cooking knowledge, historical insight, and cultural references concerning different methods of cooking by heat transfer through various mediums."

Many of the hilltops where they built their flourishing villages are now blanketed by a pastoral carpet of vines. Some historians believe the Etruscans were the first purely indigenous Italian race. But their almond-shaped eyes and slanting eyebrows led others to suggest that they may have migrated from Asia Minor. Elaborate Etruscan tombs, funerary drawings, and grave artifacts depict a vibrant society of aristocrats and slaves that formed a culture that was both obsessed with ceremony and superstitious. Divination, for example, was performed by “reading” the entrails of freshly slaughtered animals, the flight of birds, or flashes of lightning during thunderstorms. Tomb murals portray sybaritic banquets, full of wine drinking, dancing, and athletic contests. Later, this hedonism, along with Etruscan military pageantry, would profoundly affect the Romans who, by the end of the third century B.C., defeated and dissolved the Etruscan world.\n\n### Barrels in the old cellars of Castello di Volpaia.\n\nMore than an estate, **Castello di Volpaia** was built in the 11th century as a fortified village on the border between Florence and Siena. Part of the original protective walls and two of the village's six medieval towers are still standing.\n\n### Tignanello Wine\n\nMade in 1971, **Tignanello** contained no white grapes, was based almost entirely on sangiovese (later, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc were added), and was aged in small, new French oak barrels. Tignanello was like a flashlight in the dark. Other top producers immediately followed suit, making expensive proprietary wines of their own, sometimes from sangiovese blended with cabernet sauvignon, sometimes from either grape alone. What unified these wines was what they were not: They were not made according to the traditional Chianti formula specified at that time in the DOC laws (see the Appendix on Wine Laws, page 924). As a result, the government considered them mere vini da tavola (“table wines”); the press nicknamed them the Super Tuscans.\n\n### Chianti Wine Improvements\n\nThe eclectic group of Super Tuscans motivated winemakers to further improve the quality of Chianti. In 1984, **Chianti** was elevated from DOC to DOCG status, paving the way for additional improvements and many subsequent changes. Still, basic Chianti—especially when it’s moderately priced—is often a lean, old-fashioned wine, tasting less of fruit and more of structure and earth tones.\n\n---"

Although all sparkling wine in Germany is called _sekt_, there are two distinct types—the bargain stuff and fine _sekt_.\n\nBargain _sekt_—which is most of the _sekt_ made—is light, clean, and uncomplicated. Made with German grapes or with bulk wine from another European country, _sekt_'s fizziness is the result of the bulk process (the second fermentation takes place in large pressurized tanks, not in each individual bottle). Fine German _sekt_—a tiny portion of the German sparkling wine market—is entirely different from the bargain stuff. These top-notch _sekte_ are made in small lots by the traditional (Champagne) method. The grapes used are generally riesling, weissburgunder (pinot blanc), or blauburgunder (pinot gris), and the village and vineyard the grapes come from will usually be listed on the label."

Below is a structured summary:\n\n### Valpolicella Wine\nValpolicella is a type of wine produced in a specific region and comes in different styles:\n1. **Basic Valpolicella:** It is lightweight and generally inexpensive, commonly consumed.\n2. **Valpolicella Classico:** Comes from the original, smaller Valpolicella zone, tends to have better quality.\n3. **Valpolicella Classico Superiore:** Aged for at least a year, featuring enhanced quality and flavors.\n4. **Valpolicella Ripasso:** Envolved by re-fermenting basic Valpolicella with the residue of Amarone, giving it more structure and flavor. Mentioned producer: Masi with their product, Campo Fiorin.\n5. **Recioto della Valpolicella:** Made from the ripest grapes, this sweet wine involves a unique fermentation process that is stopped early, creating a rich, complex wine.\n\nThe producers mentioned include:\n- Allegrini\n- Masi\n- Bertani\n- Tedeschi \n- Quintarelli\n- Tommasi\n\n### The Bellini\nThe Bellini is a cocktail made from Prosecco and fresh white peach juice. Originating from Harry's Bar in Venice in the 1930s, it has become a popular summertime choice. The preparation uses fine, frozen white peach juice and any sparkling wine but ideally includes Italian sparkling wine for authenticity.\n\n### Comparison with Bardolino\nValpolicella is compared to Bardolino:\n- **Bardolino:** Comes from Lake Garda, lighter compared to Valpolicella, and can sometimes be spicy. Bardolino Classico is a more intense version, suggesting a higher grade of winemaking associated with the Valpolicella region.\n\nThis document effectively provides an overview of Valpolicella wines and highlights an iconic Italian cocktail, indicating the rich cultural and culinary heritage of Italy's Veneto region."

My hands are all cut to pieces and my lower back is stabbing me in perma-rictus, but the larger damage has been done to my psyche.\n\nSome background: There is this fairly tight coterie of extreme cocktail fanatics that stretches from London to San Francisco and Seattle, with outposts in Tokyo and Portland and certain bars in Boston and Philadelphia. However, New York and London are, I would say, the central hubs. I’m acquainted with most of the big players and everyone kind of knows who I am, but I’ve always been fairly peripheral to it all.\n\nThis is a very young, earnest, geeky set—all of them madly debating so-and-so’s take on the real recipe for Abbott’s bitters or crème de violette (both products that disappeared decades ago) or issuing raging diatribes on ice (the shapes; the purification processes; whether to chip block ice, like the Ginza school in Japan; whether it’s okay to use a Scotsman machine to make crushed ice or must one hammer it in a canvas Lewis bag to get the perfect consistency). Meanwhile, they’re busy crafting every conceivable tincture and infusion and finding thousands of liqueurs, pimento drams, amari, you fucking name it. It is, in short, a subworld, like many others: in cooking, in music, in writing, you will always have these überfanatics who just like to push it to the outer limit of exclusivity.\n\nSome of this is kind of great, but a lot of it I’ve always found fairly exhausting. Overall, the movement (and it is a movement at this point, really) reinforces my belief that drinks should be made with care and knowledge and employ the best possible practices in their creation.\n```"

Below is the content organized and translated into English along with the appropriate headings and details:\n\n---\n\n### Cooking Buckwheat\n\n**Preparation Time:** 5 minutes  \n**Cooking Time:** 7 minutes  \n**Resting Time:** 15 to 20 minutes\n\n#### Ingredients\n- 200 g of buckwheat\n- 40 cl of water\n- ¼ teaspoon of salt\n\n#### Instructions\n1. Lightly toast the buckwheat in a dry pan to enhance its flavor through slight moisture absorption, which also makes it ideal for millet.\n2. Then, add water and salt. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for 7 minutes with a cover.\n3. After cooking, remove from heat and let it sit covered for 15 to 20 minutes. Ensure that it does not have a strong odor and the texture remains firm to the bite.\n\n#### Chef’s Tips\n- **Tool:** Use a fine mesh strainer when rinsing buckwheat to keep the grains intact.\n- **Flavoring:** You can substitute chicken stock or spiced broth for water for added flavor.\n\n#### Good to Know\n- For optimal cooking, maintain a water to buckwheat ratio of 2:1. This means adjusting the water volume based on the desired consistency and portion size.\n- Repeat this cooking technique to identify the ideal water volumes and cooking times for your taste.\n\n---\n\n### Cooking a Tart Base \"Blind\" (Pre-baking)\n\n**Cooking Time:** 10 to 30 minutes\n\n#### Ingredients\n- Choice of tart pastry, rolled into a mold\n- Baking weights or dried beans/pulses\n\n#### Instructions\n1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.\n2. Line the pastry in the tart mold with a round of sulfurized paper larger than the mold to properly support the weights.\n3. Fill the pastry-lined mold with baking weights or dried beans to prevent the pastry from rising or becoming soggy. Chill the setup in the refrigerator before baking.\n4. Bake in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes at the initial high temperature, then remove the weights and bake for another 15 minutes at a lower heat so the base crisps well.\n\n#### Chef’s Tips\n- **Positioning:** Place the tart on the lower rack of the oven near the heat source to ensure the bottom cooks thoroughly.\n- **Serving Suggestion:** Even if the tart bottom seems perfectly crisp, consider using a damp towel beneath the tart to absorb any possible residual moisture.\n\n#### Good to Know\n- Ensure uniform heating during baking to avoid blind baking failures. If done properly, the technique can also be applied to cooking similar dishes like vegetable pies.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Reading**\n- Recipe ideas on page 3.98.\n- Maple tart and tarte aux mendiants recipes found on page 3.84."

    "contenu": "This document titled \"SUGAR CANDIES AND CONFECTIONERY\" discusses different types of sugar candies including their ingredients, cooking techniques, and historical aspects.\n\n### Caramels, Toffees, and Taffies\n- **Caramels**: These are non-crystalline candies that usually contain milkfat and milksolids. They have a creamy texture due to the presence of milk casein proteins and milk ingredients. Their caramel flavor develops through interactions between these dairy components and sugars during cooking.\n- **Toffees and Taffies**: These are firmer than caramels; toffees contain less butter and milk solids, while taffies are cooked at higher temperatures (50°F hotter than caramels) to achieve a more firm texture. Taffies do not contain butterfat, making them different from toffees which often use butter for richer dairy flavor development.\n\n### Sugar Work\n- This technique involves creating candy using sugar that can be sculpted, blown, or drawn into various shapes. The art of sugar work has been known for hundreds of years with significant mastery seen in 17th-century Italy and imperial China. Japanese \"amezaiku\" is a traditional form where artists sculpt sugar into intricate designs.\n- **Material and Technique**: Sugar work generally starts with molten sucrose mixed with glucose and fructose, which can crystallize or be combined with acids like cream of tartar to form a syrup. This is then crafted at temperatures reaching 315-330°F/157-166°C, a point where there is minimal water content, helping to prevent unwanted crystallization.\n\nThese sugar candies and confections are not only a craft but also a delight, with complex flavors and textures that vary based on their ingredients and the preparation methods used."

Technically, wine can be made with any fruit, but grapes are most common.\n\n### Vintage\n\nVintage refers to the year when the grapes were harvested. Non-vintage (NV) wines are a blend of several harvests.\n\n### Climate\n\nA temperate climate is where grapes grow best. In North America, for instance, this climate facilitates ideal grape growing conditions.\n\n### Wine Grapes vs. Table Grapes\n\nWine grapes are different than table grapes. They are much smaller, have seeds, and they are also sweeter than table grapes.\n\n### Wine Varietals\n\n- **Single-varietal wine** is made with one grape variety (e.g., Pinot Noir).\n  \n- **Wine blend** is made by mixing several wines together (e.g., Bordeaux blend).\n\n### Climate Influence on Wine Taste\n\n- Regions with **cooler climates** make wines that taste more tart.\n  \n- Regions with **warmer climates** make wines that taste more ripe.\n\n### Grapevines Growth Cycle\n\nGrapevines take a year to grow grapes. The harvest in the northern hemisphere is typically from August to October, and in the southern hemisphere from February to April."

This product is branded as \"Green Pasture.\"\n\n2. **Traditional Scandinavian Methods**: \n   - The Scandinavian preservation method for fish involves burial beneath the ground, known as \"gravfisk\" or buried fish. This method is part of their tradition tied to cured fish such as that in barrels. \n   - The effectiveness of sun-, air-, or smoke-drying is noted, but it's mentioned that it doesn't lead to significant fermentation.\n\n3. **Historical Insight on Burial of Meat and Fish**: \n   - The burial method was not just a means of storage but a necessary technique to secure and preserve food. It is described as one of the most ancient methods for these purposes.\n   - Sue Shephard, an author, explains that in the Middle Ages, foods like venison were often buried instead of being hung. The cool and moist environment of the ground allowed the food to retain moisture and ferment with the help of natural yeasts and enzymes, contributing a strong flavor to the preserved items.\n   - This method was particularly documented in colder, far northern locales. Fermentation helped in preserving the food's qualities and increasing its durability in cooler climates.\n\n4. **Practical Application in Contemporary Study**: \n   - The document mentions an archaeological attempt by the University of Capetown in South Africa to recreate the ancient method of burying whale meat in the sand, drawing upon historical records.\n\nThis narrative highlights the durability and adaptability of ancient food preservation methods and their resurgence or study in modern contexts."

A great wine is one in which quality is contained.

These storks, traditionally linked with baby delivery in mythology, are the official bird of Alsace and have been part of successful repopulation efforts after a period of decline. Their role in human culture extends far back into history, being featured in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek mythology. Storks are not only culturally significant but also visually impressive in flight, making them a worthy subject for photography during a visit to the region.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "## MAKING TOKAJI ASZÚ\n\n### Introduction\nLike all wines made with the help of *Botrytis cinerea*, Tokaji Aszú is dependent on a singular set of climatic conditions. For the botrytis fungus to take hold on healthy, ripe grapes, the region must have just the right amount of humidity and warmth (too little or too much can produce problems). \n\n### Geography and Climate of Tokaj-Hegyalja\nTokaj-Hegyalja is well situated. The Carpathian mountains, which arc around the region, shelter it from cold winds from the east, north, and west, creating prolonged, gently warm autumns. The region, shaped like a check mark, lies along a range of volcanic hills topped with loess, fine-grained deposits of silt, as well as volcanic tufa, both of which warm easily. Following the length of these hills is the Bodrog River, which meets the Tisza River at the bottom point of the check mark, near the village of Tokaj. Mists and humidity rising from these rivers are held in place by the warm hills, creating the perfect environment for botrytis to form.\n\n### Grape Varieties in Tokaj\nThe three main white grapes used in Tokaji are ideally suited for this purpose:\n- **Furmint**, which makes up about 60 percent of all grapes planted in the region, is high in acid, late-ripening, thin-skinned, and easily susceptible to botrytis. Hárslevelű—the name means \"linden leaf”—is second in importance, and although slightly less susceptible to botrytis, it, too, is high in acid as well as very aromatic and rich-tasting.\n- **Muskotály**, also known as muscat blanc à petits grains, is third in importance, highly aromatic and crisply acidic. It is used as a seasoning grape. The high acidity of these grapes naturally balances the sugar levels in the wine, ensuring that Tokaji Aszú tastes beautifully balanced, not saccharine or candied.\n  \nSince the 1990s, three other grapes—all of which are botrytis-prone and capable of attaining high sugar levels—are also allowed in Tokaji and are sometimes included in minor amounts: zéta (formerly called orémus), kövérszőlő, and kabar.\n\n### Effects of Botrytis on Grapes\nThe beneficial botrytis mold punctures the grapes' skins in search of water to germinate its spores. This causes water in the grapes to evaporate, and the grapes begin to dehydrate."

    "contenu": "# Carmenère\n\n**Pronunciation:** car-men-*ehr*\n\n---\n\nThe story of Carmenère is a bit like the tale of the ugly duckling. Banished from France’s Bordeaux, it was quietly transported to Chile, where it was previously unknown but embraced and subsequently confused with Merlot. And it thrived. When the grape was later discovered by accident to be Carmenère, a Chilean swan emerged.\n\nAlthough Carmenère is not indigenous to Chile, it might as well be, as it performs better there than anywhere else on earth. Chileans take pride in this grape, much as Argentineans do with Malbec and New Zealanders do with Sauvignon Blanc.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Names\n- Cabernelle (France)\n- Carmenelle (France)\n- Carménéyre\n- Grand Vidure (France, Chile)\n\n## Styles\nMedium- to medium-full-bodied dry red wine\n\n## Sometimes Blended With\nGrapes from the Cabernet family (Chile, France)\n\n## Flavor Lexicon\n- **Fruit/vegetable:** Blackberry, plum, tomato leaf\n- **Floral:** Black tea leaf, herbs (fresh rosemary, thyme, and tarragon), sarsaparilla\n- **Wood:** Bitter chocolate, smoke, spice\n- **Other:** Cinzano (red)\n\n## Similar Sips\n- Cabernet Franc\n- Herbal examples of Merlot\n- Mencía\n\n## Where It's Grown\n- **Australia** (Victoria: Geelong, King Valley)\n- **Chile** (Aconcagua; Central Valley: Cachapoal Valley, Colchagua Valley)\n- **France** (Bordeaux)\n- **Italy** (Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto)\n- **U.S.A.** (California)\n\n---\n\n**Jackson Five Anecdote:** Was there really a sixth Jackson (Janet) in the Jackson Five? Well, Carmenère could have been Janet, related to but not included in the nuclear family of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes—Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot. Carmenère made some significant contributions to the early wines of Bordeaux. Never a star, it was used to produce full red wines used for blending, in the same way Petit Verdot is used today. But Bordeaux was a cooler environment."
