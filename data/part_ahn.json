It is increasingly favored in water systems due to its stability compared to chlorine alone.\n- **Properties**: \n    - More stable than chlorine,\n    - Does not evaporate easily at ambient temperatures,\n    - Cannot be boiled out.\n- **Removal**: It can be challenging to remove, but charcoal filtration systems and sufficient contact time are effective. Additionally, homebrewers use Campden tablets (sodium or potassium metabisulfite) to neutralize chloramines.\n- **Usage**: Predominantly in sterilizing equipment and the water used in fermentation before yeast addition.\n- **Advice**: Check with your water supplier if your fermentation processes seem sluggish due to potential chloramine content in the water.\n\n### Salt\n- **Role in Fermentation**: Salt is used in various fermentation processes to create a selective environment favorable for the growth of specific microorganisms like lactic acid bacteria.\n- **Properties of Salt**: \n    - Salt tolerance varies among microorganisms,\n    - At higher salinity, only specialized halophilic bacteria thrive.\n- **Commercial Processing of Salt**: \n    - It is pointed out that like many refined products, commercial salt is stripped of many naturally occurring minerals during its refinement process,\n    - In the U.S., table salt typically has iodine added, which compensates for some of the natural trace minerals removed during the refining process.\n\nThese highlights offer insights into how water treatment and salt usage can significantly impact fermentation and brewing processes."

    "contenu": "### LOWER STEMS AND BULBS\n\n#### Beet, Turnip, Radish, Onion, and Others\n\nThe members of this mixed category of vegetables sit at or just below ground level, and share one characteristic in common: they store little starch compared to most roots and tubers. They're therefore usually less dense, cook more rapidly, and retain a moist texture.\n\n##### Beets\nBeet “roots” are mainly the lower stem of *Beta vulgaris*, a native of the Mediterranean and Western Europe. People have eaten this plant since prehistory, initially its leaves (chard, p. 325), then the underground part of specialized varieties (subspecies vulgaris). In Greek times beet roots were long, either white or red, and sweet; Theophrastus reported around 300 BC that they were pleasant enough to eat raw. The fat red type is first depicted in the 16th century. Table beets are about 3% sugar and some large animal-feed varieties are 8%; in the 18th century, selection for sugar production led to sugar beets with 20% sucrose. Colored beets owe their red, orange, and yellow hues to betain pigments, which are water-soluble and stain other ingredients. There are variegated varieties with alternating red layers of phloem tissue and unpigmented layers of xylem (p. 262); they look their best in raw slices because cooking causes cell damage and pigment leakage. When we eat beets, the red pigment is usually decolorized by high stomach acidity and reaction with iron in the large intestine, but people sometimes excrete the intact pigment.\n\n##### Celery Root\nCelery root or celeriac is the swollen lower portion of the main stem of a special variety of celery, *Apium graveolens var. rapaceum*. Roots project from a knobbly surface that requires deep peeling. Celeriac tastes much like celery thanks to the same oxygen-ring aromatics, and contains a moderate amount of starch (5–6% by weight). It's usually cooked like other root vegetables, but also finely shredded to make a crunchy raw salad.\n\n#### The Cabbage Family: Turnip, Radish\nThe turnip, *Brassica rapa*, has been under cultivation for about 4,000 years in Eurasia as a staple, fast-growing food. It consists of both lower stem and taproot, can have a number of different shapes and colors, and has the sulfury aroma typical of the family (p. 321). Small, mild varieties may be eaten raw and crunchy like radishes, larger ones cooked until soft: but not too long, or the overcooked cabbage flavor dominates and the texture becomes mushy. Turnips are also pickled.\n\nThe crisp, sometimes pungent radish is a different species, *Raphanus sativus*, a native of western Asia, and had reached the Mediterranean by the time of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. Like the turnip it’s mainly a swollen lower stem, and has been shaped by human selection into many distinctive forms and striking colors."

It highlights that 80 percent of all grapes in the region are now used for making wine, marking a significant shift in the industry's focus.\n\nKey points from the text include:\n\n1. **Modernization Struggles**:\n   - South Africa's wine region faces a continual battle to modernize amid geological and climactic advantages.\n   - The wine industry gets negatively impacted by economic strains, outdated technology, and poor-quality equipment.\n   - Many vineyards still operate with outdated methods, lacking modern winemaking expertise.\n\n2. **Harvesting and Labor Issues**:\n   - Harvesting processes are often inefficient.\n   - The industry suffers from frequent labor problems and occasional incidences of labor abuse.\n\n3. **Historical Challenges**:\n   - The document recounts the legacy of the \"tot system,\" where workers were paid in distilled alcohol instead of wages. This practice, despite being made illegal in 1962, contributed to prolonged issues of alcoholism and misery among workers, predominantly affecting black laborers.\n\n4. **Ethical Responses**:\n   - In response to human rights concerns, notably those documented by Human Rights Watch in 2011 regarding poor labor conditions, top wineries have established the Wine and Agriculture Industry Ethical Trade Association (WIETA).\n   - WIETA aims to enforce fair labor standards and improve conditions within the wine and fruit industries in the Western Cape.\n\nThe document is augmented by a photo of a monkey sitting contentedly among the vines, symbolizing perhaps a peaceful contrast to the sobering context of the issues discussed."

Here is the structured content:\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Vintners place great care into not only growing grapes and producing wine but also in how it's presented, preferring wines to be served in high-quality glasses like Riedel's Sommelier Series for white wine.\n\n2. **Malolactic Fermentation:**\n   - During this process, a by-product called diacetyl is produced, imparting a buttery flavor to wines like chardonnay.\n   - This fermentation results in flavors reminiscent of buttered popcorn, which don't originate from the grapes themselves but from the fermentation process.\n\n3. **Characteristics and Exceptions:**\n   - Not all wines undergo malolactic fermentation. For instance, wines like riesling retain their crisp and fruity flavors because they do not undergo this process.\n   - In some wines that have undergone malolactic fermentation, winemakers may attempt to reduce the diacetyl flavor to retain fruitier and fresher flavors.\n\n4. **Post-Fermentation Processing:**\n   - After malolactic fermentation, a period follows during which any remaining diacetyl can be metabolized by yeasts, reducing its buttery effect. This process includes a brief dosing with sulfur dioxide which helps in stabilizing the wine.\n\n5. **Taste Influence of Malolactic Fermentation:**\n   - While chardonnay can exemplify the buttery flavor from diacetyl, red wines can also display butter flavors although typically they are more influenced by tannins, which can occasionally result in an unpleasantly sharp taste.\n\n6. **Identifying Malolactic Fermentation in Wines:**\n   - The document suggests that it's not typically indicated whether a wine has undergone malolactic fermentation, adding a mystique to the wine's flavor and texture profile that might inspire but also confuse consumers."

    "contenu": "# Tempeh feels slimy\n\nA slimy coating on the tempeh suggests that the tempeh overheated during incubation. Once the mold becomes established and starts to grow rapidly, it generates significant heat. It is possible for the heat that the mold growth generates to kill the mold, especially if the blocks of tempeh are thick, if there is limited ventilation in the incubation chamber, or if a large batch of tempeh is crowded in a small incubation chamber. Viable spores of the extremely heat-tolerant bacteria *Bacillus subtilis* are generally present on the tempeh substrates, even after cooking. While the tempeh mold is growing, it prevents *B. subtilis* from developing; however, if the tempeh mold is destroyed by excessive heat, the *B. subtilis* is at the ready, and starts to develop, with its telltale slimy coating and distinctive aroma. This does not make the tempeh dangerous, but it does result in poorly bound tempeh with a sharp flavor. When this has happened to me, I mark the tempeh “grade B” and crumble it into heavily seasoned chili and sloppy-joe-type dishes.\n\n# Tempeh turns black\n\nWhen the tempeh mold first becomes visible, as its mycelia bind the beans and grains together, it is white. After about 24 hours of growth, the mold begins to develop darker patches of gray-black, indicating the beginning of sporulation. In a plastic bag with holes poked in it, sporulation begins near the holes, where the mold has the greatest access to oxygen. In an open-tray system, the entire surface can begin to darken. The early stages of sporulation are typically the sign that the tempeh has incubated long enough and is ready to eat. If the tempeh is not removed from the incubator, sporulation will continue, and with it stronger smell and flavor."

Here is a structured summary of the content:\n\n1. **Introduction to Barbera**:\n   - **Initial Courses**: Recommended to start with antipasti, pasta, etc., pairing with Barbera.\n   - **Barbera with frizzante styles**: Although harder to find, they are excellent accompaniments to rich foods.\n\n2. **Barbera vs Sangiovese**:\n   - Recognized as the quintessential wine to accompany dishes with \"red\" sauces, outperforming even Sangiovese from Chianti in this regard due to its high acidity and bright fruit flavors. These qualities enhance the flavors of dishes, making them \"pop\".\n\n3. **Ideal Food Pairings**:\n   - **Red Meats and Grills**: Works well with veal chops, grilled halibut, and simple roast lamb.\n   - **Vegetarian Options**: Suitable for grilled portobello mushrooms and Asian-flavor dishes like char siu.\n   - **Other Pairings**: Complements tandoori chicken, Vietnamese shaking beef, and even pizza or burritos. \n\n4. **Special Affinity with Mushrooms**:\n   - Mushrooms and Barbera share a particular affinity that is enhanced when paired with sautéed mushrooms or dishes like steak and crostini with mushroom toppings. Adding garlic or herbs can tie the flavors together more effectively.\n\n5. **Modern-style Bottling Notes**:\n   - These tend to be oaky, influencing the choice of food pairing. If the wine is smoky and sweet, pairing with mesquite or other charcoal-grilled foods is recommended. Rich, oaky Barbera should be paired with richer food preparations.\n\n6. **Pairing Pointers**:\n   - **Comfort Foods**: Barbera pairs excellently with burgers, pizzas, meat loaves, and burritos.\n   - **Italian Charcuterie**: Matches well with soppresatta, mortadella, bologna, prosciutto, and lardo.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Versatile with various kinds, from morels to portobellos.\n   - **Seafood**: Pairs well with grilled tuna and swordfish; can be paired with a tomato vinaigrette or tapenade to enhance flavors.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes Barbera's versatility, particularly its capability to enhance meals with complex and rich flavors, making it a suitable choice for a variety of dishes spanning from vegetarian options to hearty meats and charcuterie."

Here's a structured breakdown of its content:\n\n### PLANT FOODS THROUGH HISTORY\n\n#### Ancient and Early Civilizations:\n- **Initial cultivation and diets**: Early European diets included wheat, fava beans, peas, turnips, onions, radishes, and cabbage. In Central America, corn, beans, squashes, tomatoes, and avocados began cultivation around 3500 BCE. Northern Asia utilized millets, cabbage relatives, soybeans, and tree fruits among others.\n- **Spices and trade**: In Sumer and early Egypt, a variety of plants were already in use. By 5000 years ago, trade between Egypt and the Middle East involved spices like cinnamon (from Sri Lanka by around 1200 BCE).\n\n#### Greece, Rome, and the Middle Ages:\n- **Dietary preferences and developments**:\n  - **Greece**: The Greeks enjoyed lettuce and habitually ate fruit at the end of meals. Pepper from the Far East became popular around 500 BCE.\n  - **Rome**: Romans expanded the use of vegetables, introducing cabbage, fruits, and wines, continuing the development of Italy's heavy spice habit.\n  - **Middle Ages**: Few named vegetable varieties were known; recipes from Apicius indicate a preference for strong flavors and Roman culinary influences.\n\n#### New World, New Foods:\n- **Columbian Exchange**: The arrival of New World plants played a crucial role in changing European diets and agricultural practices during the Renaissance.\n- **Key explorers**: Notable figures such as Columbus, Vasco da Gama, John Cabot, and Magellan sought new routes to access Asian spices and inadvertently introduced new plant foods to Europe.\n- **Introduction of spices and vegetables to Europe**: The introduction of vanilla was initially disappointing but quickly became popular, paralleling the successful integration of new vegetables.\n\n### Summary:\nThis document traces the evolution of plant foods from ancient civilizations through the global explorations that introduced a wide variety of new foods to different cultures, significantly impacting diets worldwide."

    "contenu": "### Riesling Wine: Global Varieties and Vintner Choices\n\n#### Global Extend of Riesling\nThe European Riesling models are popular not just in Germany and Alsace, but they have also extended into warmer regions in Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Central Europe like Austria, Hungary, and Romania. Australia, known for being exceptionally warm, has surprisingly become a source of many great bottles of world-class Riesling, especially from regions like Clare and Eden Valleys, Adelaide Hills, and Tasmania. New Zealand offers distinct Rieslings from regions like the Central Otago and Marlborough. Austria, although has a climate similar to New Zealand, continues to maintain a rich and classical take on Riesling.\n\nNorth American producers of Riesling have taken a freeform approach to this grape variety. Being no specific style to adhere to, producers have experimented with different blends and styles from Washington State, British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley, and California’s Mendocino and Central Coast areas. American Rieslings, particularly from regions like New York’s Finger Lakes and Michigan, are also gaining popularity for both dry and sweet styles. Canadian Riesling Eisweins from Ontario's Niagara region, known for their dessert wine quality, are also noteworthy.\n\n#### Vintner Choices with Riesling\nRiesling offers fewer winemaking options compared to Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc, especially in terms of sparkling wine. Generally also found as a still wine, Riesling can range from dry to sweet based on vintner decisions taken early enough in the production season. Decisions about harvesting time, style, and wine aging (minimal for Riesling) affect the final product. For Riesling table wine, the fermentation style chosen can vary between dry (similar to the Alsatian style) or opting for sweeter late-harvest styles. The vintners’ decisions during the grape growing season ultimately determine the taste and type of Riesling produced.\n\n#### Note\nA detailed table of principal wine-growing regions for Riesling can be found on pages 270-271 of the document."

Here is a structured summary of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Document Summary:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Preventing Mold and Spoilage:**\n   - **Removing Moldy Leaves:** Regularly check and remove rolled up cabbage leaves on the top of the ferment if they appear moldy as these do not necessarily affect the vegetables below.\n   - **Covering with Olive Oil:** Some people cover the surface of the ferment with olive oil to prevent air exposure and potential spoilage.\n\n2. **Effective Fermentation Practices:**\n   - **Air Exposure:** The best method to prevent surface growths is by protecting the ferment from air by using heavy plastic bags filled with water or brine to cover the full surface of the vessel, or using specially designed crocks or lids. \n   - **Book Reference:** Further details are provided in \"Crock Lids and Different Crock Designs\" mentioned in chapter 3. \n   - **Fluid Levels Check:** It's important to periodically check the fluid levels and replenish as needed, especially in dry conditions.\n   - **Removing Top Layer:** If there is mold or dry layers on the vegetables, removing the top layer is often sufficient to preserve the rest. Ensuring vegetables are submerged is essential.\n\n3. **Refrigeration Benefits:**\n   - **Disappearance of Odors:** Offensive odors and appearances (e.g., mold and maggots) can decrease or disappear once the ferment is tightly packed and refrigerated.\n\n4. **Success Stories:**\n   - **Wild West Ferments:** Luke Regalbuto and Maggie Levinger, who operate under the label \"Wild West Ferments\" in Northern California, have experienced the benefits and transformation in their fermented products.\n\n5. **General Encouragement:**\n   - **Persistence:** Encouragement for people to not discard fermentations quickly due to initial bad odors or appearances, as these often improve with proper handling and refrigeration.\n\n**Highlighted Question:** \"Which Vegetables Can Be Fermented?\" This question suggests a broader topic or subsequent section might follow regarding suitable vegetables for fermentation.\n\n---\n\nThis layout covers the provided text's guidance on fermentation and problem-solving within that context, along with highlighting personal success stories and encouraging a perseverant approach to common fermentation issues."

Here is the structured content from the document provided:\n\n### Loquat\n- **Description:** Loquats bear little resemblance to their cousin pomes. They are small, elongated fruits of the Chinese tree, *Eriobotrya japonica*, improved by the Japanese and taken to many subtropical regions in the 19th century, notably Sicily.\n- **Features:** Ripen early, before cherries. Has a delicate flavor, containing carotenoids, ranging from white to orange. Mainly ornamental in the U.S. but used widely in Southeast Asia and Europe for making fresh jams or cooked in a syrup like “pickled” peaches.\n- **Climate Adaptation:** Not chill-sensitive, nor climacteric but keep well.\n\n### Stone Fruits: Apricot, Cherry, Peach, and Plum\n- **General Definition:** All stone fruits are species of the genus *Prunus*, part of the rose family, surrounding a single large seed with a hard shell (stone).\n- **Species Diversity:** 15 species of *Prunus* are distributed across the northern hemisphere.\n- **Individual Fruit Notes:**\n  - **Apricot:** *Prunus armeniaca*, native to China, adapted in the Mediterranean. Many varieties exist, blossom early in mild, predictable winters. Japanese culture uses *Prunus mume* for umeboshi.\n  - **Cherry, Peach, Plum:** Derived from an ovary above the base of the flower with no remnants of the flower apparent.\n\n### Context on Stone Fruits\n- **Culinary Uses:** Often used in European pastries and sweets due to their distinct flavors and rich in natural sugar and antioxidants.\n- **Economic Importance:** Especially in Asia, they are significant for their lack of starch storage and their development of aroma and flavors under specific climatical conditions.\n\nThis structured information categorizes the details about loquat and stone fruits as provided in the text."
