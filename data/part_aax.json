    "contenu": "# Tasting and Evaluating Cocktails\n\nIt’s very easy to pour a few ounces of booze into a mixing glass or shaking tin and call it a cocktail. Sometimes that cocktail will even be delicious, but more often it will taste like what it is: a random assortment of liquids that’s more or less palatable.\n\nThe drinks that enjoy a long, sometimes immortal lifetime among the world’s canon of classic cocktails—and those that make their way onto the menu at Death & Co—are born from a combination of careful thought, applied knowledge, tireless trial and error, and, sometimes, informed dumb luck.\n\nWithin the genesis of every new drink lies an important question: are you trying to present a new idea in cocktail form, or are you creating just for the sake of creation? If the latter, it’s probably not going to be very good. It will lack the soul that all of the best drinks possess. A successful drink needs a focus, be it an inspiring ingredient, a new flavor combination, or a thematic idea, and sometimes employs a combination of these.\n\nAt Death & Co, our bartenders arrive at new cocktails using various strategies and tricks (more on these in a bit), but before any bartender—professional or otherwise—begins working on new drinks, he or she must first have a thorough understanding of some core principles. Chief among them is balance.\n\nCocktails are, above anything else, about balancing aggressive flavors and ingredients. The combination of sour, sweet, and strong is the three-legged stool of any drink. If one leg is too long or short, the drink will topple and be ill suited to its purpose. The creation of a well-balanced drink requires a delicate balancing act."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the historical context and evolution of wine production in Burgundy compared to Bordeaux, focusing on transportation challenges and shifts in land ownership due to political changes:\n\n- **Transport Challenges**: Historically, Burgundy was less known than Bordeaux due to its inland location. Wine in Burgundy faced significant transport challenges. It was primarily shipped through the Gironde Estuary and then transported over land, which was difficult until better transport routes were established in the fourteenth century. This shift contributed to Burgundy's recognition and demand for its wines.\n\n- **Impact of the French Revolution**: The French Revolution in 1789 dramatically altered the landscape of wine ownership in Burgundy. The Revolution resulted in the confiscation and redistribution of land previously controlled by Burgundy's dukes to local farmers. Furthermore, the implementation of the Napoleonic Code of 1804 led to the fragmentation of these lands because it mandated equal inheritance among children. This legal change has resulted in modern-day Burgundians often owning only small portions of vineyards.\n\nOverall, this document details how geography, historical events, and legislative changes have shaped the wine production and ownership in Burgundy, contrasting it with Bordeaux's earlier fame and broader recognition."

Here is a concise summary of the key points from each section:\n\n### Edible Plants - Effects of Freezing on Food Texture\n\n- Freezing temperatures generally reduce enzymatic activity but can concentrate other reactions, enhancing the degradation of vitamins and pigments.\n- Blanching is recommended for vegetables before freezing to inactivate enzymes and prevent browning.\n- Fruits are less commonly blanched because it affects their cooked flavor and texture.\n- To improve the texture of frozen fruit, a sugar syrup can be added. This syrup, usually a quarter water containing about 680 grams per liter of sugar, also prevents large ice crystals from forming and freezer burn.\n\n### Cooking Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\n\n- Vegetables and fruits are typically easier to cook compared to meat and dairy products.\n- The main composition of fruits and vegetables is carbohydrates, which disperse more evenly within their tissue.\n- Cooking can challenge the behavior of carbohydrates, colors, flavors, and nutritional content.\n- The aim when cooking is to create appealing textures and flavors without losing color and nutrition.\n\n### How Heat Affects the Qualities of Fruits and Vegetables\n\n- Heat can alter the pigments in plants. For example, some pigments dissolve in fats rather than in water, impacting the color retention after cooking.\n- Carotenoids can change when cooked, such as beta-carotene in carrots which becomes more available for the body to absorb.\n\n### Aromas from Altered Carotenoid Pigments\n\n- Cooking and drying break the pigment molecules in carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables into smaller, volatile fragments.\n- These fragments contribute to the aroma, providing scents reminiscent of black tea, hay, honey, and violets.\n\nEach section provides specific information on the biochemical processes and practical tips for handling and cooking fruits and vegetables to retain their nutritional quality and sensory properties."

    "contenu": "### BINS AND SHOWS\n\nAustralian wines are labeled varietally, making label reading easy enough. But there are two idiosyncrasies that will be helpful for a wine drinker to know about: bin numbers and designations such as Show Reserve.\n\nBin numbers are used by many Australian wine companies as the names of various wines. Penfolds, for example, makes three cabernet sauvignons—Bin 407, Bin 707, and Bin 389—each of which is a different blend and is priced differently. Probably the most recognized bin number is Lindemans Bin 65 chardonnay, one of the biggest-selling brands of chardonnay in the world. Bin numbers were put on Australian wine labels as early as the 1930s, although it’s not clear exactly when the practice began. Originally the numbers were probably a winemaker’s way of tracking the wines through blending and aging, and signified the underground cellar bin or place in the winery where a given wine was typically stored year after year. The shorthand stuck, and now countless Australian wines are known by their bin numbers.\n\nSpecial designations, such as Show Reserve, frequently appear on wine labels, but such terms have no legal definition. Rather, they refer to the fact that the wine has won an award in one of Australia's many wine shows or competitions. More than wine drinkers elsewhere in the world, Australians take wine competitions seriously and have a good deal of faith in their results."

The Greeks drink an average of 7 gallons (25 liters) of wine per person per year.\n\n**Introduction to Greece's Wine Culture:**\n- **Birthplace of Western Civilization:** Greece is known as the birthplace of Western civilization and has a deep-rooted wine culture.\n- **Significance of Wine:** In ancient Greek culture, wine, gifted by the god Dionysus, represented worthiness and luxury. It was intertwined with religious celebrations and intellectual discussions.\n- **Influential Figures:** Prominent philosophers and thinkers such as Homer, Plato, Aristotle, and Hippocrates celebrated the virtues of wine in their works, linking it to health, creativity, and philosophical discussions.\n\n**Geographical Influence on Greek Wine Culture:**\n- **Geographical Borders:** Greece is bordered by Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania to the north and by Turkey to the east.\n- **Terrain:** Despite being perceived primarily as an island nation, Greece includes a large land area characterized by rugged peninsulas and a dominant coastline, mostly making up its borders except for a small portion in the northwest.\n- **Coastline:** Greece features 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) of coastline.\n\n**History of Winemaking in Greece:**\n- **Origins:** The exact beginnings of winemaking in Greece are unclear, but evidence suggests that grapevines were first domesticated around 8000 B.C. in the so-called Fertile Triangle.\n- **Development:** Introduction and spread of vine cultivation through the Taurus Mountains and Caucasus Mountains, followed by extensive trade practices that spread Greek wine culture to Egypt, southern Greece, and the Minoan civilization on Crete around 3200 to 2000 B.C.\n- **Archaeological Evidence:** Indications of ancient Greek winemaking include residue of resin in wine jars, hieroglyphic signs on amphorae relating to wine trade, and wine labels.\n\n**Cultural Impact:**\n- **Spread Through Mediterranean:** Greek influence expanded through trade, particularly in wine, which also facilitated social connections across the Mediterranean.\n- **Integrated Practices:** Trading practices included intricate winemaking techniques and consequently, the ethos, politics, health, and philosophy spread throughout the Mediterranean regions inspired by Greek practices.\n\nThis document underscores Greece's historical and cultural significance in the realms of wine production and consumption, highlighting its storied past and rich traditions in viticulture and wine trading."

For all practical purposes, the single area that matters most (and the one to know) is the Western Cape—an area concentrated in the southwestern part of the country, bordered on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the south by the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe geology of the Western Cape is ancient and remarkable. Massive geologic upheavals over millions of years resulted in majestic mountain ranges on the southern tip of the Cape. The enormous pressures exerted during these upheavals caused folding and uplifting, creating high peaks and deep valleys. On these slopes and in these valleys, South African viticulture takes place today. About 250 million years ago, an intensive period of folding and uplifting occurred, followed by massive erosion that “flat-topped” the mountains. The results were dramatic sandstone mountains like Table Mountain (3,563 feet/1,086 meters high) and Simonsberg (4,590 feet/1,399 meters high)."

    "contenu": "# Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n## Sherry\n\n**Sherry** is more than any other wine, defined by the processes used during maturation. This includes the **solera system**, biological ageing or oxidative ageing, which are not unique to the region of Jerez but are exploited there to their fullest extent.\n\n### In the Vineyard\n\n#### Climate and Soils\nThe vineyard area is around the southern Spanish town of Jerez de la Frontera, known for sherry production. Notably, the climate is hot and Mediterranean, although cooler near the coast, benefiting from the prevailing cool humid westerly known as the _Poniente_. Hot east winds called _Levante_ can affect the area, stressing the vines with extreme heat. The soil in this region is notably albariza, known for its high chalk content and excellent water retention, vital in sustaining the vines over hot, dry summers.\n\n#### Grape Varieties\n1. **Palomino** - The predominant grape in Jerez, ideal for styles influenced by biological or oxidative maturation.\n2. **Pedro Ximénez** - Known for a thinner skin and utilized mainly for sweet sherries. \n3. **Moscatel** - Predominantly used outside Jerez but contributes to the grape variety in the region.\n\n### Unique Characteristics \n\nJerez exploits local climate conditions such as the creation of depressions between vine rows during autumn and winter to trap water. This aids in maintaining soil moisture, essential for the dry growing season. The distinct albariza soil forms a crust that limits evaporation and provides sustained moisture during the summer."

    "contenu": "Below is the extracted structured content from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Chocolat\n\nLe traitement complexe subi par la plupart des chocolats explique les grandes variations dans leurs saveurs. Les fèves non traitées sont astringentes, leur fermentation développe des arômes fruités comme dans le vin ou le xérès, et leur torréfaction peut introduire une infinité de notes noisetées, terreuse, boisées, florales ou épicées. La saveur d’un chocolat de qualité s’apprécie le mieux en laissant fondre un morceau posé sur la langue. Plus le chocolat est sucré, plus son goût va ressortir rapidement. À l’inverse, plus le pourcentage en cacao est élevé, plus il faut de temps aux saveurs pour se révéler, tandis que l’amertume et la longueur en bouche augmentent. Goûter un chocolat à 99 ou 100 % de cacao, c’est un peu comme faire courir sa langue sur un rail de la ligne de chemin de fer entre Paris et Lyon. Dans cette section, le terme « chocolat » inclut le chocolat noir de couverture, le chocolat au lait et le cacao. Le chocolat blanc est traité séparément (voir Chocolat blanc).\n\n#### Chocolat & Abricot \n- voir Abricot & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Amande\n- Quel est le goût de la culpabilité parentale ? Certainement celui de la barre de Toblerone que votre père vous rapportait de son dernier voyage, achetée in extremis à l’aéroport à la place de la paire de maracas promise ou de la véritable patte d’ours convoitée. Le secret de son succès doit forcément être lié à la géniale compatibilité entre le chocolat et les amandes. De nombreuses notes au goût de noisette se forment durant la torréfaction des fèves de cacao ; de même, la saveur des amandes est intensifiée lorsqu’elles sont grillées, ce qui leur permet de résister à la force du chocolat. Vous pouvez tester cela dans la soupe de chocolat aux amandes salées de Christophe Tan. Faites fondre à feu moyen-doux 1 cuillerée à soupe de beurre doux dans une poêle et faites-y sauter 45 g d’amandes effilées durant 4 à 5 minutes, le temps qu’elles soient bien dorées. Réservez. Dans une casserole, à feu moyen-doux, fouettez ensemble 250 ml d'eau, 100 ml de crème liquide, 25 g de sucre en poudre et 40 g de cacao en poudre tamisé, jusqu’à ce que le sucre soit dissous. Laissez bouillonner doucement 2 à 3 minutes, puis ajoutez 100 g de copeaux de chocolat noir à 60 % de cacao minimum. Remuez au fouet pour obtenir une consistance lisse, puis versez dans des petits bols (entre 4 et 6). Répartissez les amandes au-dessus, saupoudrez avec quelques grains de fleur de sel et servez immédiatement.\n\n#### Chocolat & Ananas \n- voir Ananas & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Anis\n- voir Anis & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Avocat\n- voir Avocat & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Banane\n- voir Banane & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Betterave\n- voir Betterave & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Boudin noir\n- voir Boudin noir & Chocolat.\n\n#### Chocolat & Cacahuète\n- Selon Alexandre Dumas, les Espagnols appellent les arachides cacahuète en raison de leur goût voisin de celui du cacao. Il note également qu'ils ont profité de cette harmonie de saveurs pour mélanger de petites quantités de cacao – cher à une mixture de cacahuetes pour produire une sorte de chocolat bon marché. Cinquante ans plus tard, le GooGoo Cluster, un mélange de chocolat, d’arachides, de caramel et de guimauve, devient la première barre chocolatée aux États-Unis. À la fin des années 1920, Reese’s et Mars lancent respectivement Peanut Butter Cups et Snickers, cette dernière, s’étant ensuite imposée comme la barre chocolatée favorite des Américains, une position qu’elle occupe encore de nos jours. Les arachides non grillées, légumineuses à la saveur végétale, ne s’accordent pas trop au chocolat. Le succès de la plupart des combinaisons de cacahuètes et de chocolat est dû à la formation de pyrazines durant la torréfaction de celles-ci, qui s’harmonisent avec les notes grillées du chocolat. Utilisez cette association pour des desserts dans le style des diners, ces restaurants nord-américains servant dans une ambiance décontractée une cuisine traditionnelle avec un large choix, comme un sundae à la crème glacée à la vanille garnie d’éclats de cacahuètes grillées et nappée de sauce au chocolat, ou un milk-shake à base de beurre de cacahuètes liquéfié et de---"

The diagram follows a sequential process from left to right, detailing each step involved in the production of white wine. The stages are illustrated with corresponding images and labels:\n\n1. **Crushing**: Grapes are shown in a harvest box, indicating the initial crushing process where grapes are pressed to release their juices.\n\n2. **Pressing**: The crushed grapes are then put into a wine press, which extracts the juice in a more refined manner, separating it from skins and seeds.\n\n3. **Alcoholic Fermentation**: The extracted juice is transferred to a fermentation tank where yeast is added to convert the sugars in the juice into alcohol and carbon dioxide.\n\n4. **Storage or Maturation**: Post-fermentation, the wine is stored in tanks and sometimes in barrels to mature, developing its flavors and aromas.\n\n5. **Packaging**: Finally, the matured wine is bottled and prepared for distribution and sale.\n\nEach step is connected by green arrows indicating the flow of the process.
