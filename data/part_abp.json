    "contenu": "**The Story of Foodpairing**\n\n**Bernard Lahousse**\n\nWhy do some ingredients pair especially well together, while others do not? This is a question that has undoubtedly kept many of us in the food industry up at night.\n\nIt was my keen interest in food science and gastronomy that led me to bioengineering. In 2005 I began asking around to see if any chefs in Belgium were interested in partnering with a food scientist to expand their culinary practices. My first collaborators were Michelin-starred chefs Sang-Hoon Degeimbre of L'Air du Temps in Liernu and Kobe Desramaults of In de Wulf in Dranouter. We met regularly to brainstorm and discuss potential menu items they had in the works. It was during one of our sessions that Sang-Hoon asked, \"Bernard, why is it that when I smell kiwis, I also smell the sea? Is that possible?\"\n\nFortunately, a fellow bioengineer by the name of Jeroen Lammertyn had access to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) equipment. Together we ran an aroma analysis and found that in addition to fruity esters, kiwis also contain concentrations of green, grassy and fatty-scented aldehydes that have a marine-like scent similar to that of oysters and other types of shellfish. The aromatic link between these two seemingly unrelated ingredients formed the basis of our very first foodpairing and so the kiwi/hre was born. Degeimbre’s singular creation has since become a signature dish on the menu at L'Air du Temps.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the science of foodpairings, I wondered if anyone else had puzzled over my hypothesis that complementary ingredients share key aromas. I discovered that François Benzi, a food chemist at the Swiss fragrance and flavour company Firmenich, had made a similar discovery in 1992. I contacted him and we met several times in Geneva to discuss the notion that ingredients that pair well contain the same aroma molecules.\n\n**The kiwtire**\nThe story of Foodpairing starts with a dish created by chef Sang-Hoon Degeimbre: a raw oyster served over diced kiwi, with croutons and a lime-infused coconut cream. Kiwi and oysters share a marine-like aroma note."

With its extensive range and the various wine styles it represents, it merits its own dedicated book. The analogy of a diverse and large family, similar to the one in *My Big Fat Greek Wedding*, is used to describe the varied characteristics and origins of Muscat grapes. The Muscat Blanca a Petit Grains grape is notably traditional and Greek in origin, regarded as noble, social, and gregarious. In contrast, the Muscat of Alexandria grape is less extroverted and originates from Egypt.\n\n#### Alternative Names\n- **Petits Grains**: Frontignac, Muscat d’Alsace, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise, Muscat Frontignan (France); Brown Muscat, Frontignan (Australia); Goldmuskateller, Moscato Bianco, Moscato Giallo, Moscato Rosa, Romaneuskmuskateller (Italy); Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Moscatel Menudo Blanco, Moscatel Dorado (Spain); Musukadel (South Africa); Moscatel Branco (Portugal); Muscat Blanc, Muscat Canelli, Muscat Frontignan, White Muscat (U.S.A.)\n  \n- **Alexandria**: Chasselas Musqué, Muscat Romain (France); Lexia, Muscatel, Muscat Gordo Blanco (Australia); Hanepoot (South Africa); Zibibbo (Italy); Moscatel, Moscatel de Málaga, Moscatel Gordo Blanco, Moscatel Romans (Spain); Moscatel de Setúbal (Portugal); Moscatel de Alejandría (Chile)\n\n- **Ottonel**: Muskotály (Hungary); Muscadel Ottonel (South Africa)\n\n#### Wine Styles\n- Medium- to medium-full-bodied dry white, medium-full-bodied off-dry white, light- to medium-bodied slightly sparkling off-dry white, light- to medium-bodied off-dry to sweet sparkling, full-bodied late-harvest sweet, full-bodied fortified sweet\n\n#### Blending Practices\nMuscat varieties are usually unblended, with the exception in southwestern France, where Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria are blended together. \n\nThis detailed content extraction provides an overview of Muscat grapes discussing the varieties, names alternative, styles of wines, and blending traditions."

    "contenu": "### THE FLAVOR OF HISTORY\n\nIf you want to taste something really old, Madeira is the answer. While finding a bottle of Bordeaux from, say, the 1960s can be daunting (not to mention fiscally dangerous), Madeiras that are a century old or more can easily be found in specialty wine shops. Indeed, vintage Madeiras that go back to the founding of the United States, in 1776, are known to exist. (For my part, I have tasted Blandy’s Madeiras back to the awesome, luscious 1811, which redefined my notion of exquisite.) What makes these centuries, especially outstanding is, of course, their spellbinding complexity and aliveness. Properly sealed, a bottle of Madeira will easily outlive its owner, and remain in excellent condition throughout its life. Importantly, because it's already been oxidized and maderized, Madeira is nearly indestructible. During colonial times (pre-refrigeration), this fact made Madeira especially appealing in the American South, where bottles could survive over decades of hot summers without any ill effects.\n\nAlthough the islands are on the same parallel as Los Angeles and Jerusalem, they get a lot of rain—more, in fact, than London. But luckily, most of it falls in winter—between October and April, when the vines are mostly dormant. Nonetheless, mold and mildew are threats, and some vineyards are planted up on high trellises so that they are lifted way above the ground and dew. A potentially more serious danger is the leste, an intense heat wave blowing off the Sahara desert, which can cover the vines in sand and dust and raise the temperature to more than 100°F (38°C) for weeks at a time."

The grape is Spanish by origin, primarily known by the local names monastrell in northern Spain and mataró in the Pyrenees region.\n  - It has a significant historical origin, supposedly propagated by monks next to Castilla-La Mancha, in the province of Valencia. Its Latin derivation from \"monasteriellum\" ties the variety’s history to monastic practices.\n  - The variety is utilized widely in the south-central region of Castilla-La Mancha, particularly in Jumilla, where it is used to produce muscular wines with dry, bitter, espresso-like flavors.\n\n- **Use in Wine Making**:\n  - In the Rhône region of Southern France, a small amount of mourvèdre is often used in blends such as Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Côtes-du-Rhône to add depth, color, and complexity.\n  - Before the phylloxera epidemic, mourvèdre was widely planted across the south and has been integral in shaping the regional wine profile.\n\n### General Information\n- The document framed its discussion on the varietals by acknowledging the extensive plant varieties of grapes and focused deeply on Merlot and Mourvèdre to provide insight into their styles and historical significance in wine-making."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects of cooking and utilizing seeds, with a focus on maintaining and altering the texture of cooked beans, reducing cooking times, and briefly touches on fermented legumes in India. Here's a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Maintaining the Texture of Cooked Beans\n- **Cooking Water Content**: The content of dissolved substances in cooking water can influence beans by either reinforcing the cell walls, thus preventing softening (as with hard water rich in calcium or magnesium), or by accelerating the softening and dissolution of cell-wall hemicelluloses (with acidic or alkaline cooking water).\n- **Cooking Approach**: Contrary to some beliefs, adding salt to the soaking water helps beans absorb water more slowly but more thoroughly, resulting in a faster cooking time once they are prepared.\n\n### Reducing Cooking Times by Presoaking\n- **Presoaking Beans**: Soaking beans in water reduces the overall cooking time by around 25% or more. The rationale is that heat penetrates dried seeds more quickly than those soaked, though much of the perceived cooking time is actually due to waiting for the water to penetrate into the beans during cooking.\n\n### Briefly Fermented Legumes in India\n- **Local Fermentation Practices**: Despite a lower general popularity of fermented foods in India compared to other places, some legumes and rice preparations are slightly fermented. Examples include:\n  - **Idli**: Fermented cakes made from black gram and rice.\n  - **Dosa**: A crispy, crepe-like dish made from rice and black gram.\n  - **Papadums**: Thin wafers of black gram pasted, fermented briefly, then fried or dried.\n  \nThe document elaborates on these methods as adaptations to enhance flavor, improve texture, and modify cooking times of legume-based dishes."

Both the Adige and Po rivers, on their way to the Adriatic Sea, flow across the broad plains of the Veneto, creating large expanses of rich, sun-drenched farmland where vegetables and fruits, including grapes, grow profusely. Since great wines in general come not from fertile soil but from the opposite, the Veneto’s best vines tend to be planted near hills, on well-drained volcanic soil interspersed with sand, clay, and gravel.\n\n#### The Most Important Veneto Wines\n\n| Leading Wines      |\n|----------------------|\n| AMARONE red          |\n| PINOT GRIGIO white   |\n| PROSECCO white (sparkling)|\n| SOAVE white          |\n| VALPOLICELLA red     |\n\n#### Wines of Note\n\n| Wine Variety | Type |\n|--------------|------|\n| BARDOLINO | red |\n| BIANCO DI CUSTOZA | white |\n| CABERNET SAUVIGNON | red |\n| CHARDONNAY | white |\n| MERLOT | red |\n| RECIOTO DELLA VALPOLICELLA | red (sweet) |\n| RECIOTO DI SOAVE | white (sweet) |\n\nThe Veneto can be divided into three zones. In the far west, near Lake Garda and the volcanic mountain range of Monte Lessini, the traditional wines Soave, Valpolicella, Bardolino, and amarone are produced, as well as Bianco di Custoza, one of those simple sorts of white wines that taste best when drunk in a bar (the wine, not you) in the region where they’re made. Verona, the major city, is one of Italy’s wine capitals; each year, the country’s largest wine fair, Vinitaly, is held here. (Spread over five or more coliseum-size buildings, the fair includes so many thousands of Italian wines that tasting them all could take weeks.) In the Veneto’s northern hills above Treviso (held to be the radicchio capital of Italy), Prosecco is made. What is considered more or less the center of the Veneto, from Venice to Vicenza, is the source of several different types of wine, ranging from simple merlots, cabernet sauvignons, chardonnays, and pinot grigios of no particular distinction (Santa Margherita pinot grigio comes from here) to more exciting wines, especially from around Breganze, Colli Berici, and Colli Euganei."

Recently I began making sauerkraut. My gut problems have nearly disappeared, and I am slowly adding back the occasional wheat product (a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie were my first tests, and a pizza is coming up next!). I think my natural probiotics had been wiped out by frequent rounds of antibiotics for Lyme disease, cardiac problems requiring antibiotics before dental work, and so on.\n\nWell-being and healing are not simple phenomena attributable to any single determinative factor. Fermented foods are not _the_ secret to health and longevity. Nor is exercise, nor a curious mind, nor an open heart, nor a wholesome diet, nor inner contentment, nor sexual bliss, nor regular bowel movements, nor restful sleep. But each of these, along with innumerable other factors, influences the overall state of our well-being. And fermented foods are part of the picture.\n\nIn this chapter, I will briefly describe the major nutritional and health benefits of fermented foods and beverages, summarize findings of the peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature, and try to answer some of the questions that have come up repeatedly, in my email and public presentations. It is the purported health benefits that are drawing many people to become aware of fermented foods as such. I do not have absolute answers. Scientific understandings of the role of bacteria in mediating and regulating physiological processes in our bodies are crude and rudimentary. Even less is understood about the dynamics of ingesting live bacteria.\n```"

Yeast used for fermentation must be either added in the form of commercial packets or introduced through raw fruits exposed to fresh air.\n- Suggestion is made for conducting small experimental fermentation batches before scaling up.\n\n### Title: Fermented Fruit Salads\n\n#### Content:\n- Fermentation techniques can be applied to solid foods, such as fruits, to produce alcoholic products.\n- Mark Ericson shares an anecdote about his pastor's grandfather who maintained a jar of \"friendship fruit\" fermenting in sugar, typically using canned fruits or fruit cocktails.\n- The use of a fermenting starter is recommended to initiate the fermentation process in these fruit-based mixtures. The sharing of these starters among individuals helps perpetuate the production of fermented fruits.\n- Fresh fruit is mentioned as a potential ingredient in these fermentations, providing necessary natural sugars to support the fermentation process."

Here is the content broken down into markdown format for better readability:\n\n---\n\n### Concentrations will kill yeast\n- It advises filtering water, boiling it in an open vessel, or letting the water stand for a couple of days for chlorine to evaporate before use. It's important to check if your tap water contains non-volatile chloramines.\n\n### Mold developed on the surface of your ferment\n- To handle mold, gently skim the mold off the surface. If that's not feasible, siphon the liquid below the mold into another vessel, leaving the mold behind.\n- In the early stages of wild fermentation, it's crucial to stir frequently. This prevents mold as stirring disturbs the surface. Insufficient stirring often leads to mold development.\n\n### Your ferment tastes like vinegar\n- Fermented alcoholic beverages exposed to air can turn into vinegar over time due to acetic-acid-producing bacteria known as *Acetobacter*, which are present everywhere and require oxygen to grow.\n- During vigorous fermentation phases, yeasts dominate and carbon dioxide released protects against vinegar formation. However, as fermentation wanes, the risk of turning into vinegar increases, especially in open vessels.\n- To prevent this, one should consume the beverage quickly after fermentation or transfer it to a narrow-necked jug or carbony air-locked container to limit air exposure.\n\nThis summary tackles specific issues in fermenting processes and provides practical solutions to address or prevent these problems."
