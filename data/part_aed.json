    "contenu": "# CHAMPAGNE\n\nFor many wine drinkers, Champagne is not simply a wine; it is also a state of mind. Handed a glass, we simply abandon ourselves to its dizzying pleasure. How a mere beverage achieved such distinction is a complex story, made all the more rewarding because of its unlikeliness.\n\nThe story begins 70 million years ago, in the Mesozoic era, when a vast prehistoric sea covered northern France and Britain. As the waters receded and the so-called Paris Basin sank, a great crescent of limestone, rich with minerals and marine fossils, was left behind. From this geologic legacy would eventually emerge the beautiful, chilly vineyards of Champagne. Sunlight here is painfully scarce, and vines exist at their limits of cold tolerance—the average temperature, amazingly, is no more than 50°F (10°C).\n\n> “Remember gentlemen, it’s not just France we are fighting for, it’s Champagne!”\n> \n> — **SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL**\n\nThe wine Champagne comes from the region of Champagne, 90 miles northeast of Paris. Here, the vineyard land—considered among the most expensive in the world—is owned, primarily, by fifteen thousand small growers. A majority of the grapes they raise will be made into Champagne by nearly 350 wine firms, known as houses (Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, and Taittinger are famous examples). In addition, more than 4,500 of the 15,000 growers make their own limited-production, often stellar, Champagnes. And there are also 136 cooperatives, several of which, like Collet and Nicolas Feuillatte, boast Champagnes of very good quality.\n\nWell-known wines have been made in the Champagne region since Roman times. Those wines (both red and white) were, for much of their history, only slightly effervescent, not bubbly. By the Middle Ages, the wines had found a receptive audience among affluent locals, for Champagne was a wealthy region known for its superb and expensive textiles. Indeed, many Champagne houses were eventually begun by the well-to-do German accountants of textile firms—men with names like Krug, Heidsieck, Mumm, and Deutz.\n\nThe name *Champagne* was first used in the sixth century and is derived from *campagna remensis*, a Latin term for the countryside around the city of Reims.\n\nAs the seventeenth century drew to a close, the blended sparkling wine we recognize as Champagne began to emerge. It was not suddenly invented, as the story goes, by a monk named Dom Pérignon (although he was important in its development). Rather, Champagne was the curious result of decades of work by many Champenois, based on a"

Indulgences (if not contraband) elsewhere, foie gras and confit of duck are virtually daily fare here, and the propensity to sauté the accompanying potatoes (or just about any other vegetable) in duck fat, too, leaves French nutritionists wondering why the local population isn’t keeling over. But in Gascony, eating traditionally matters. Not surprisingly, so does drinking well.\n\n*Caption: Monsieur Gessler sits among his oldest Armagnacs at Domaine de Joÿ.*\n\nAs the local desserts—soufflé of prunes in Armagnac and fruit strudel laced with Armagnac—reveal, this is the home of one of France’s most well-loved brandies. Armagnac (ARE-ma-nyack) is far less famous than its sister, Cognac, and the two are usually assumed to be quite similar, since both are distilled from grapes. Not so.

Originating from the Piedmontese dialect meaning \"difficult\" or \"stubborn,\" Arneis is known for being challenging to cultivate and vinify. Historically referred to as Nebbiolo Bianco, it is praised for its delicate and nuanced profile, yet often criticized for its low acidity which can lead to lesser vibrancy in the wines.\n\n## Global Planting and Vinification Trends\n- **California:** Winemakers in California are experimenting with Arneis by producing wines with varying levels of acidity, from rich, quince-like fruity flavors to more flabby profiles.\n- **Oregon:** Only Ponzi Vineyards has ventured into bottling Arneis, despite recognizing the grape’s potential.\n- **Australia:** Over thirty wineries are exploring Arneis, particularly in Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula and King Valley, suggesting a growing acceptance and experimentation with the grape.\n\n## Key Viticultural Considerations\nDifferences in the vineyard management of Arneis can notably affect the resulting wine:\n- **Age of Vines:** Young vs. Aged vines\n- **Harvest Time:** Early vs. Late harvest\n- **Oak Usage:** Oak-aged vs. Non-oak\n- **Soil Type:** Sandy vs. Clay soils\n- **Altitude:** Low vs. High altitudes\n\nThese factors can influence the wine's acidity, flavor profile, and overall complexity.\n\n## Winemaking and Aging\nArneis requires precise timing for harvesting to balance ripeness and acidity optimally. It is generally recommended to drink Arneis young, as its naturally low acidity does not favor long-term aging. Some producers explore high-altitude vineyards and non-oak aging methods to retain more floral aromatics and maintain the wine's freshness and subtlety.\n\n## Pairing with Food\nArneis pairs well with various foods due to its versatility:\n- **Ideal Dishes:** Lightly seasoned dishes, green herbs (like salsa verde), simple seafood, and lean poultry are excellent with Arneis.\n- **Cooking Methods:** Low-impact techniques that preserve the integrity of the primary ingredients work best.\n- **Flavor Enhancers:** Acidic elements such as lemon or tomato can complement Arneis’s profile by balancing its subdued acidity.\n\nThe grape's relatively low alcohol content also broadens its pairing versatility with various cooking styles and ingredients, from simple pastas to complex, spiced dishes like Chinese salt-and-pepper shrimp.\n\n## Conclusion\nDespite its challenges, Arneis is finding its place in the global wine market. Its adaptability to different terroirs and winemaking techniques has allowed it to thrive outside its native Italian regions, offering a nuanced choice for wine enthusiasts looking for something beyond the usual white wine selections.\n```"

    "contenu": "Here's the structured content and main points extracted from the document titled \"COOKING WITH WINE\":\n\n### COOKING WITH WINE\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Wine is commonly used in cooking, usually in liberal amounts, because it provides more flavor and richness than water. It is frequently included for a final splash of flavor in various dishes.\n\n2. **Concerns About Alcohol in Cooking**\n   - Common question: What happens to the alcohol?\n   - Alcohol remains after cooking but reduces significantly:\n     - 85% remains immediately after alcohol is added to a boiling liquid.\n     - 40% remains after cooking for 15 minutes.\n     - 25% after one hour.\n     - 5% after two and a half hours.\n   - Most wine contains between 12 and 15 percent alcohol by volume. For most people, the final amount of alcohol in a dish is usually not a significant concern.\n\n3. **Guidelines for Cooking with Wine**\n   - **Never use poor-quality wine** in dishes. If it's not good enough to drink, it shouldn't be used in cooking.\n   - **Avoid using \"cooking sherry\"** or other similar wines meant specifically for cooking, as they are typically of lower quality and may contain additives like salt and food coloring.\n\n4. **Quotes**\n   - W. C. Fields: “I cook with wine; sometimes I even add it to the food.”\n\n5. **Specific Wine Recommendations**\n   - **Dry white wine**: Sauvignon blanc or Sancerre are preferred for their fresh, light flavor.\n   - **Dry red wine**: Suitable for hearty dishes. Recommended to use robust wines like shiraz, zinfandel, or wines from the south of Spain, Italy, or France.\n   - **Port, Madeira, Marsala, Sherry**: These fortified wines are ideal for cooking due to their rich flavors and slightly higher alcohol content.\n     - **Note**: These wines should be of good quality and properly opened to be used effectively in cooking.\n\n6. **Conclusion**\n   - Using wine in cooking enhances flavor. The key is using appropriate wines that add the desired depth and nuances to the dish without overpowering it. Quality and suitability to the dish being prepared are critical."

The metal is placed in a shallow metal container, and sparks are flying around as the work is being done, which suggests some form of hammering or forging happening.\n\n2. **Bottom Image Description:**\n   The bottom image captures a different scene where hot metal is being cooled in a wooden bucket. The bucket's wooden staves are visible, and a glowing piece of metal is resting on what appears to be a stand inside the bucket, surrounded by either water or some other cooling agent, generating steam or smoke.\n\nBoth images together portray steps in the processing of metal, where the first is likely involved in shaping the metal, and the second in cooling or tempering it after it has been heated and worked upon. These are typical processes in traditional blacksmithing and metal work crafts."

The text suggests that merely liking or disliking a wine isn't as memorable unless specific descriptive words are attached to it.\n\n2. **LEARNING AROMA WORDS IS EASY; JUST FOLLOW YOUR NOSE.**\n   - This section discusses how to develop a descriptive aroma lexicon with conscious effort and sensory exploration. It recommends practicing scent identification by visiting places like the produce aisle, spice racks, or tea shops to connect scents to words. It proposes that repeating or noting down the scent names can help in memorising them and also encourages exploration of other scent sources like soaps and flowers.\n\nThe document concludes with:\n- **MARNIE'S CORNER**\n  - A reflection on the essential role of scent in wine perception. It states that the sense of smell, often downplayed in modern society which focuses more on sights and sounds, carries a primitive quality and is strongly linked to memory. Experiencing a wine's aroma can invoke vivid memories and emotional connections, transporting one to different places or times.\n\nEach section emphasizes the holistic and emotive power of scents in enhancing and recalling the experience of wine tasting."

Below are the structured details gathered from the text:\n\n### Swizzle Sticks\n- **Usage**:\n  - Swizzle sticks are primarily used to mix drinks in crushed ice.\n  - They are effective in blending due to their small prongs at the end.\n  - Commonly used for drinks like juleps, swizzles, and Ti' Punch, a rum-based drink popular in the French-speaking Caribbean.\n\n- **Method**:\n  - They operate similarly to a manual immersion blender, swirling around in the drink for efficient mixing.\n  - This method quickly chills the drink due to increased surface contact with the ice.\n\n- **Design**:\n  - Typically, swizzle sticks have a long handle with multiple spindles.\n  - They are trimmed based on the necessity for effective use.\n  - The length must support two hands for use, mimicking the swizzle technique seen in \"The Karate Kid, Part II\".\n\n### Mixing Vessels\n- **Type**: Mixing Glasses {for making stirred drinks}\n  \n- **Characteristics**:\n  - There isn't one perfect vessel for stirred drinks due to each having its pros and cons.\n  - A common choice is a standard pint glass, made from durable tempered glass to withstand temperature changes.\n\n- **Advantages**:\n  - The pint glass’s tapered shape facilitates easier stirring. It allows the user to move the stirring spoon around smoothly and at different angles.\n\n- **Limitations**:\n  - If the pint glass is too narrow, it requires precise and controlled stirring.\n  - Shaking tins also serve as stirring vessels but come with some disadvantages. \n\nThis document does not mention the specifics of what these disadvantages with shaking tins are, nor does it provide details beyond the use of pint glasses for stirred drinks.

The meat turns purple when less oxygen is present.\n   - Over time, with little oxygen, the iron in myoglobin loses an electron and the meat becomes browner.\n\n2. **Muscle Fibers, Tissues, and Meat Flavor**:\n   - The appeal of meat is largely due to the proteins and energy-generating systems in muscle fibers which contribute to its taste and aroma.\n   - The flavor originates from the breakdown of muscle fibers during cooking. This releases amino acids and other substances that generate a meaty flavor.\n   - Meatiness is influenced by the tissue composition and the encompassing fat.\n\n3. **Visual Aids**:\n   - The document includes a description correlated with a molecular illustration explaining how myoglobin's color changes due to oxygen levels. \n   - The heme group, an essential component of myoglobin, changes from purple to red to brown based on the binding of oxygen and the oxidation state of the iron atom.\n\n4. **Packaged Meat Color**:\n   - Meat appears purple in vacuum packaging due to lack of oxygen and turns red once it is exposed to air.\n\nThis text provides insights into the biochemical processes affecting meat color, composition, and flavor, which are fundamental for understanding meat quality and processing."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content provided in the document.\n\n### Image Description\n**Caption:** Fall Creek Vineyards in the Texas Hill Country near Austin. In the mid 1970s, owners Ed and Susan Auler were among the first in Texas to take a serious approach to grape growing and winemaking.\n\n### Text Content\n\n#### Introductory Paragraph\nThis paragraph sets up the history of the Texas wine industry noting:\n- In the mid-1970s, Fall Creek Vineyards was among the pioneers in modern Texan wine making.\n- Prior to Prohibition, there were at least sixteen commercial wineries in Texas. Only Val Verde Winery, near Del Rio on the Rio Grande, continued operation afterward.\n- The resurgence of the wine industry in Texas occurred in the 1970s in a distinctly Texan manner.\n\n#### Highlighted Section: \"THE QUICK SIP ON TEXAS\"\n- **Historical Context**: Texas is one of the oldest wine regions in the United States.\n- **Grape Varieties**: \n  - Primary: Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay.\n  - Other varieties: Tempranillo and Syrah to Viognier and Roussanne.\n- **Winery Count**: Nearly 250 wineries span across Texas, with various microclimates influencing their distribution.\n\n#### Story of Ed and Susan Auler (1973)\n- **Background**: Ed Auler was a cattle rancher and lawyer.\n- **Inspiration**: A trip to France and a tour of vineyards in Burgundy inspired the Aulers to start vineyard operations reminiscent of their ranch's environment in Texas Hill Country.\n- **Outcome**: Ten years after their inspiration, Fall Creek Vineyards was founded.\n\n#### Development Elsewhere in Texas\n- **Location**: High Plains, Lubbock.\n- **Event**: In 1974, alongside Texas Tech professor Bob Reed and Clinton McPherson, experimentation began on grape growing with 100 varieties initiating as a scientific project.\n- **Evolution**: This initiative evolved into the successful Llano Estacado Winery.\n\nThis narrative succinctly illustrates the blend of traditional methods and innovative approaches that led to the revival and growth of the Texas wine industry from individual initiatives to broader scale developments."

Meals are served sealed in jars with orange rubber crowns to ensure hermetic sealing, reminiscent of traditional methods used by grandmothers.\n3. **Mission**: As a Team Leader, the individual is tasked with contributing to the creation of new meal suggestions, specifically vegetarian boxes. The requirements for these suggestions include:\n   - Respecting the seasonality of vegetables.\n   - Prioritizing labeled vegetables.\n   - Varying the vegetable categories.\n\n**Flowchart Components**:\nThe flowchart has four main colored rectangular nodes labeled with the names of dishes, likely representing different seasonal meal suggestions:\n- Potage d'Halloween (Halloween Soup)\n- Wok d'hiver (Winter Wok)\n- Méli-Mélo Printanier (Spring Mix-Up)\n- Salade de l'été (Summer Salad)\n\nEach labeled node has three branches with blank spaces for details, pointing towards images of jars, indicating that details about each dish (ingredients, preparation, and presentation) are to be filled in corresponding to the respective dishes.\n\nThis layout supports an educational activity where students plan and outline specific vegetable-based meals fitting various criteria and suitable for different seasons. The end result would be these meals arranged in sealable jars, likely as practical implementations of the theoretical planning done in this exercise."
