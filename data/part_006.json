    "contenu": "The content and images from the provided document are structured around the topic of fats, their chemical bonding, and their properties such as saturation and consistency. Here's a detailed structured breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### Fats, Oils, and Relatives (Page 799)\n\n#### Types of Fat Molecules:\n- **Unsaturated Lipids**: Have one or more double bonds between carbon atoms along its backbone. \n  - **Polyunsaturated**: Contains more than one double bond.\n- **Saturated Lipids**: No double bonds, allowing it to stretch out completely straight.\n\n#### Fat Saturation and Consistency:\n- Fats with double bonds in their chemical structure tend to be more irregular due to the kinks caused by these bonds. These kinks prevent the fat molecules from packing tightly in solid form.\n- Saturated fats have straight chains and are less prone to kinking, allowing them to pack more tightly and solidify more readily at room temperature. These are described as \"zippering\" more easily.\n- Fat saturation is cited as a significant factor because it affects the geometric regularity of the fatty acid chain which influences its chemical and physical properties. \n  - **Example**: Beef and lamb fats are solid at room temperature, reflecting a higher saturation level compared to oils, which are mostly unsaturated fats.\n\n#### Impact of Double Bonds:\n- Double bonds reduce the ability of fatty acids to \"zip\" together as efficiently, which can lower the melting point of fats.\n- The variability in fat structures (due to the number of fatty acids and their configuration) determines whether the end product is more oil-like or solid.\n\n#### Fat Saturation and Rancidity:\n- Saturated fats are more stable and resistant to becoming rancid compared to unsaturated fats.\n\n#### Illustrated Molecular Structures:\n- **Saturated Fatty Acid**: Depicted as a straight chain.\n- **Cis Mono-Unsaturated Fatty Acid**: Shows a single kink or bend.\n- **Cis Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acid**: Illustrates multiple kinks along the chain.\n- **Trans Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acid**: Shows a configuration that mimics straight chains, despite having double bonds.\n\n#### In-depth Analysis of Unsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids:\n- **Unsaturated Fatty Acids**: The presence of one or more double bonds introduces a rigid kink at these points, hindering the ability of these molecules to solidify into compact crystals at a given temperature. These fats are softer than saturated fats at the same temperature.\n- **Hydrogenation Process**: In the process to harden vegetable oils, some cis-unsaturated fatty acids are converted into trans-unsaturated fatty acids, making them less kinked and more similar to saturated fatty acids in behavior and utility both in cooking and within the body.\n\n---\n\nThis structured breakdown presents an informative overview of the content, emphasizing the chemical structures and the implications on the physical state and stability of different types of fats."

    "contenu": "The structured content of the document titled \"THE SEX LIFE OF WINE GRAPES\" can be outlined with the main points as follows:\n\n1. **Hermaphroditic Nature:**\n   - Wine grapes are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs, allowing them to self-pollinate.\n\n2. **Pollination:**\n   - Pollination occurs mostly during spring when conditions are right (temperature, weather). Issues like rain or cold can disrupt this process, potentially leading to a lack of flowering and thus no grapes.\n\n3. **Flowering Process:**\n   - The flowering process in grapevines leads to the development of flowers, which under ideal circumstances, will become clusters of grapes.\n\n4. **Wild vs. Cultivated Grapevines:**\n   - Wild grapevines may be male, female, or hermaphroditic. Female wild plants need a male for pollen to produce fruit. Male plants, on the other hand, do not yield fruit.\n   - Cultivated grapevines are typically hermaphroditic to ensure self-pollination and consistent fruit production.\n\n5. **Historical Cultivation:**\n   - Early cultivation of grapevines, dating back to 7000 to 5000 B.C., likely began with the selection of naturally hermaphroditic plants for their ability to self-reproduce, ensuring fruit production.\n\nThe document highlights how the reproductive strategy of grapevines, primarily being hermaphroditic, has been advantageous in viticulture, enabling consistent self-fertilization and grape production."

Below is a structured summary of the content:\n\n1. **Natural Behavior and Reproduction**\n   - Chickens accumulate eggs until a certain number are in the nest.\n   - If an egg is taken by a predator, the hen will lay another to replace it.\n   - \"Indeterminate layers\" produce many more eggs than more deterministic layers, such as wild Indian jungle fowl which lay clutches of about twelve glossy, brown eggs a few times each year.\n   - Domesticated cousins of these wild birds will lay an egg a day for a year or more.\n\n2. **Culinary Use of Eggs**\n   - Historical use: Eggs have been roasted since humans mastered fire. The Romans had recipes using eggs, like \"ova frixa,\" which included fried, boiled, and “soft” eggs and custom recipes like patina from Apicius.\n   - Recent recipes: In modern European cuisine, eggs are used to create savory quiches, sweet custards, and sophisticated dishes like omelets.\n\n3. **Evolution and Breeding**\n   - The chicken underwent significant evolutionary changes between 1850 and 1900.\n   - Selective breeding in the 19th century, fueled by the facination of Europeans and Americans with the exotic East, brought new breeds to the West like the large, showy Cochins from China.\n   - Examples compared to \"hen fever\" similar to the Dutch tulip mania of the 17th century, showcasing the historical craze for breeding and owning exotic birds.\n\n4. **Recipes Included in the Document**\n   - Roman Custards, Savory and Sweet:\n      a. **Patina of Soles**\n         - Ingredients: Soles, oil, liquamen (fish sauce), wine, pepper, lovage, oregano, cooking liquid, eggs.\n         - Preparation: Clean fish, cook with seasonings and wine, mix in eggs, cook slowly, and sprinkle with pepper to serve.\n      b. **Cheese Patina**\n         - Ingredients: Milk, honey, eggs, pepper.\n         - Preparation: Mix milk and honey, add eggs, cook slowly until thickens, sprinkle with pepper to serve.\n\nThis document combines both historical context and practical recipes, giving a comprehensive overview of the importance and versatility of chickens and eggs throughout history."

Below is a structured summary of the content:\n\n1. **Tannins as Natural Antioxidant Preservatives**\n   - **Key Points:**\n     - Tannins act as natural antioxidant preservatives, critical for the development and aging of red wines.\n     - Without tannins, red wine would deteriorate quickly, similar to low-tannin Beaujolais wines which are best when young.\n     - Tannins help prevent rapid oxidation and ensure that wines age slowly, often resulting in softer wines over time.\n     - Cabernet Sauvignon is noted for its ability to age well due to high tannin content from its small berries and thick skins.\n\n2. **Depth of Color and Tannin**\n   - **Key Points:**\n     - Historically, darker wines were believed to contain more tannins and were expected to age better.\n     - This belief is outdated as the preference for wine styles has shifted. Modern markets favor wines that are flavorful and ready to drink sooner with softer, \"velvety\" tannins.\n     - The shift in market preferences reflects a reduced desire for wines that require extensive aging to reach their peak.\n     - Current trends indicate that even intensely tannic wines no longer maintain a deep, ink-like color as they might have in the past.\n\nThe section is labeled \"WINE TASTING\" and is from page 67, indicating it might be part of a larger educational or informational text on wine."

Otherwise, they will find it and lay eggs on it, and when the eggs hatch, you will find maggots crawling out of your food. I protect fermenting crocks from flies with old sheets or other finely woven cotton fabrics; in the summer months, when flies are most plentiful, I tie a string around the cloth to secure its edges. If you do find maggots in your kraut-chi, there is no need to panic or discard the whole batch. As they hatch on the surface of a ferment, maggots migrate up and out of the food; they do not burrow farther down. Remove the top inch or so of the fermenting vegetables, and go as deep as necessary until you reach kraut-chi with no sign of maggots, no discoloration, and a pleasant aroma. Be sure to wipe the interior sides of the vessel to remove any eggs that may have been laid.\n\n**Illustration:**\n- Depicts several eggplants."

    "contenu": "# Black Peppercorns\n\nBlack, white, green and red peppercorns all come from the same plant: *Piper nigrum*, a flowering vine native to India. The only difference is that the berries are picked and processed differently to achieve each variety's unique flavor. They all get their spicy kick from a pungent compound called piperine.\n\n## Harvesting and Processing\nBlack peppercorns are harvested while the berries are still green, just before they reach full maturity. They are then blanched in hot water, which causes their cell walls to rupture, thereby speeding up the browning process. The berries shrink as they are sun-dried (or sometimes dried in the oven), causing them to shrink and wrinkle as they oxidize and turn dark brown or black. Dried black peppercorns still have their husks intact, which adds to their citrusy, floral and woody fragrance. To produce white peppercorns, the ripe, red berries of the *Piper nigrum* plant are placed in sacks that are soaked in water, which causes microbial activity to break down the husks. Red peppercorns are simply fully mature, ripe red peppercorns that have been dried.\n\nThe term 'pink peppercorns', however, is something of a misnomer, since these small, pinkish-red berries grow on the Peruvian pepper tree (*Schinus molle*) and the Brazilian pepper tree (*Schinus terebinthifolius*), which are cousins of the cashew family. Similar in flavor to black peppercorns but with a much more delicate flavor, pink peppercorns contain highly volatile compounds that dissipate quickly when exposed to the elements.\n\n## Storage Recommendations\nAll pepper loses its potency once it has been exposed to light: its flavour and aroma begin to evaporate as the piperine transforms into a bland compound known as isochavicine. It is therefore best to store whole peppercorns in an airtight container away from light and heat. Grind pepper just before use, as the aromatics start to dissipate once the peppercorns have been ground.\n\n## Culinary Uses\n- The classic French *steak au poivre* calls for pan-seared filet mignon encrusted in cracked black pepper, served with a creamy cognac sauce and a side of French fries.\n- All it takes to make *cacio e pepe* is cooked spaghetti tossed in good olive oil, butter, black pepper and a handful of finely grated Pecorino Romano.\n- *Bò lúc lắc*, which means 'shaking beef' in Vietnamese, is a dish of tender cubes of beef marinated in a combination of oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, fish sauce and sugar, then flash-fried in sesame oil with onions and coarsely ground Cambodian Kampot peppercorns. This dish is served with fresh tomatoes.\n\n## Related Aroma Profile: Green Peppercorn\nGreen peppercorns contain more green, herbal notes than the black variety. Popular in the cuisines of Thailand and other Asian countries, these unripe berries are easily perishable and usually preserved or pickled in vinegar or a brine, or sold freeze-dried.\n\n---\n\n### Aroma Profile for Green Peppercorn\n\n| Aroma Note | Intensity |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Gîne de Mahon | 6 |\n| Nutmeg | 6 |\n| Nasturtium citrus fruit | 5 |\n| Fresh lavender flower | 5 |\n| Carrot | 5 |\n| Kumquat peel | 4 |\n| Celery juice | 4 |\n| Veal stock | 4 |\n| Boiled green beans | 3 |\n| Oven-cooked bacon | 1 |"

    "contenu": "### Document Analysis: \"Controlled Spoilage\" in Food Fermentation\n\n**Summary:**\nThe document discusses the concept of controlled spoilage in foods such as cheese and the cultural perception of flavors that arise from fermentation. It emphasizes the biochemical processes that break down fats and proteins, creating distinct flavors that are either appreciated or deemed as spoiled depending on cultural contexts.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Biochemical Processes in Cheese:**\n   - Animal fats and proteins are broken down into highly odorous molecules during cheese fermentation, similar to molecules produced during uncontrolled spoilage.\n   - The transformation in cheese and certain animal foods can produce an aversion due to the odor of decay, which historically helped in avoiding food poisoning.\n\n2. **Perception of Spoilage and Fermentation:**\n   - There exists a thin, often indistinguishable line between what is considered fresh and what is considered rotten in the context of food fermentation.\n   - The article references Sidney Mintz, who points out the subjective nature of what is considered fermented versus rotten, as influenced by cultural upbringing and societal norms.\n\n3. **Cultural Influence and Subjectivity:**\n   - The document points out that the distinction between fermented and spoiled foods is not clear-cut but is shaped by cultural perceptions and social learning.\n   - It cautions against interpreting the lack of firm boundaries as an invitation to disregard traditional food safety norms, highlighting that these boundaries, though culturally determined, are essential for determining what is edible and safe.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n- The document suggests that the understanding and acceptance of fermentation and what many consider spoilage are subjectively defined by cultural contexts.\n- Learning to appreciate certain flavors that arise from fermentation involves redefining personal and communal boundaries regarding food safety and edibility.\n\n**Notes:**\n- References [73] and [74] indicate sources or footnotes for further validation but are not detailed in the document."

    "contenu": "# Hazelnut\n\n## Introduction\nRaw hazelnuts have a distinct green, bell-pepper-like scent because of their nutty flavour and characteristic hazelnut smell from compounds known as ketones.\n\n## Types and Uses\nHazelnuts, also known as filberts or cobnuts, offer a versatile use in blended pastes, sweet and savory dishes, or as a flavor enhancer for coffee. They contain high fat, facilitating quick roasting without the need for pre-soaking.\n\n## Species and Characteristics\nHazelnuts mainly come from the genus _Corylus_. The common commercially available trees are _Corylus avellana_ and _Corylus maxima_. Notable varieties of these species include the Kentish Cob, known for its juciy, crispy texture and mildly sweet, mild flavour.\n\n## Processing\nUpon maturation, raw \"green\" hazelnuts can be processed by roasting, which firms up their texture and shifts their flavor profile to a richer nutty taste. To peel the nuts, you can blanch them for 4 minutes, then soak in cold water. The skins should easily peel off after this treatment.\n\n## Historical Context\n- **Gianduja Origin**: In early 19th century northern Italy, during cocoa shortages, chocolatiers in Turin began adding local hazelnuts into chocolate, creating a paste called _cioccolato di Gianduja_. This practice, initially a wartime necessity, became a culinary tradition.\n- **Post-War Developments**: After World War II, as cocoa was again in short supply, Pietro Ferrero created a solid block chocolate containing hazelnuts named 'Pasta Gianduja' and later renamed 'Supercema Gianduja'. This product eventually evolved into what is now globally known as Nutella.\n\n## Aroma Profile\nRoasting hazelnuts increases the concentration of ketones, enhancing other aroma molecules like pyrazines, furans, bases, and aldehydes, all contributing to the distinct hazelnut aroma. The related aroma profile (roasted hazelnut) includes notes similar to:\n- Pine\n- Peach\n- Mint\n- Basil\n- Lemon\n- Walnut\n\n## Visual: Aroma Profile Table\nThe document includes a detailed aroma profile table that shows the relatedness of 'roasted hazelnut' flavor notes to various other foods measured across aroma components like ketone, lactone, pyrazine, and more."

The recipe is designed to make 4 to 6 main-course servings.\n\nHere's the structured content of the recipe, including ingredients and instructions:\n\n### Roast Rack of Lamb with Creamy Rice with Parsnips\n**Chef:** Dan Barber  \n**Location:** Blue Hill, New York City, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, New York\n\n**Servings:** Makes 4 to 6 main-course servings\n\n#### Ingredients\n**Creamy Rice:**\n- 1 cup basmati rice\n- 2 cups water\n- 1½ teaspoons canola oil\n- ½ pound parsnips (2 small), peeled and cut into ½-inch chunks (about 1 cup)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 2¼ cups vegetable stock, or as needed\n- Chopped fresh chives for garnish\n\n**Lamb:**\n- Canola oil for searing\n- 2 (8-bone) lamb racks\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n#### Instructions\n1. **Preheat the oven to 425°F** for the lamb. Start cooking the rice by combining the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the water has been fully absorbed and the rice is tender, about 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. It should yield about 3 cups of cooked rice.\n\n2. In another saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the parsnips, season with salt and pepper, and sauté gently until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Do not allow the parsnips to color. Add 1½ cups of the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook uncovered, until the parsnips are tender and the stock has reduced by about half, 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n3. Transfer the parsnips and their cooking liquid to a blender and process until smooth. If the purée is too thick, add a little more stock. You should have about 1 cup purée. Set aside.\n\n4. Begin roasting the lamb while the rice is cooking. Film the bottom of a large skillet with canola oil and place over medium-high heat until hot. Season both sides of the lamb racks liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, place the racks, fat side down, in the pan and sear until golden brown on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and sear on the second side until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, place in the oven, and roast for 20 minutes for medium-rare, or until done to your liking.\n\nThis detailed recipe is a culinary work of precision in its preparation, balancing flavors and textures, typical of Chef Dan Barber’s style."

Sloping ground, for example, encourages water drainage which in turn helps in sun heat absorption differently.\n- **Terroir Expression**: Wine connoisseurs value the detection and appreciation of the terroir, noticeable from one vineyard to another. This aspect also covers how winemakers attempt to manage and minimize less-than-ideal conditions.\n- **Modern Developments**: There is a growing trend in manipulating grape fermentation and ripening to compensate for less ideal growing conditions, shifting wine toward being more a product of technology rather than strictly from natural terroir.\n\n### MAKING WINE\n\n#### Overview of Wine Production\n- **Stages of Production**:\n  1. **Crushing**: Ripe grapes are crushed to release juice.\n  2. **Fermentation**: Juice is fermented by yeasts converting sugars to alcohol.\n  3. **Aging**: Wine matures, enhancing chemical complexity and stability.\n\n#### Detailed Process\n- **Crushing Grapes to Make the Must**:\n  - Extracts juice. The quality of final wine largely depends on this stage.\n  - Skin, seeds, and pulp influence the wine's compounds like phenolics, tannins, and aromas. \n  - The press used differentiates between less clear and richer 'free run' juice from the initial pressing, and subsequent presses that may contain more solids.\n\n#### Additional Information\n- **Image Description**: Shows grapes and mentions how different parts of the grape (like the seeds, stem, and pulp) contain varying concentrations of sugars, acids, and other flavor components which are influential in winemaking.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the main points addressed in the given document, providing an organized representation of the insights on wine production and viticulture."

The texture is described in terms of resistance when biting down, and the aroma carries flavors and distinctiveness that rises into the nose as you breathe out.\n- **Overall Experience**: Meat serves as a robust foundation for incorporating different ingredients, enhancing its complexity and forming a \"great Gothic cathedral of a recipe.\"\n\n### Fish (Described as \"Oceanic\")\n- **Initial Description**: Avoids the term \"fishy\" due to its negative connotations, focusing instead on the cleanliness and appealing aspect when freshly caught.\n- **Components of Taste**:\n  1. **Bouquet**: More restricted compared to meat and mainly characterized by clear implications involving herbs, aromatic spices, and tangy flavors.\n  2. **Tasting Experience**: It involves a subtle play on the tongue, particularly with white-fleshed fishes. Enhanced tasting with fish that contain more oil (like salmon or bluefish).\n  3. **Texture and Flavor Matrix**: The texture is also enjoyable, punctuating tastebud interactions and elevating the overall experience by separating distinct flavors which are enhanced when breathing out.\n\n- **Overall Sensory Framework**: Combines aroma, palate, and texture into a comprehensive experience referred to as \"Oceanic,\" with considerations to maybe focusing on shellfish separately to highlight their unique aspects.\n\nThis document is insightful in how it elaborates on the nuanced flavors and experiences of different kinds of animal protein, specifically through sensory perceptions related to cooking and tasting."

Here is the content detailed:\n\n---\n\n### Temperature\n\nRegardless of the color of wines, all are kept at the same temperature. However, the red wines are consumed when warm and white wines are consumed when cold. A too cold white wine will have a weak flavor and a too warm red wine will tend to be more alcoholic. Red wine should be given time before consuming for the temperature to rise and white wine is best when chilled before consumption.\n\nHence, it is paramount to store the wines correctly to preserve the flavors. Fluctuating temperatures can vary the taste of wine. Temperatures between 50 and 55 degrees are perfect to allow the wine flavor to mature. Wine cellars are the ideal storage place to maintain the quality of wine, a cool basement or a kitchen refrigerator can also serve the purpose.\n\n---"

It explains how wines might change their character when paired with food and over the course of consumption.\n\n3. **Cork taint is the most common cause for wine to be rejected; such wines are said to be \"corked.\"**\n   - Explains the phenomenon of cork taint, commonly referred to as \"corked\" wine, which is typically identified by an offensive smell likened to a mildewed basement. This section clarifies that cork taint is due to the presence of TCA (trichloroanisole), which can stem from the cork itself or from treatments used on corks. It mentions that opinions differ on what percentage of wines are affected by cork taint but emphasizes that flawed wines are more often consumed than returned. It suggests consulting a wine steward if there is any doubt about the wine’s condition.\n\nThis structured breakdown serves to educate restaurant patrons on the nuances of wine tasting and handling, promoting a more informed and proactive approach to wine selection in dining settings."

Here's a structured summary under different headers:\n\n### Introduction to Cognac Region\n- The Cognac region in France is characterized by its gentle and pastoral landscapes, featuring vineyards, cornfields, and meadows.\n- It spans 197,000 acres and lies about one-and-a-half hours north of Bordeaux, having a distinct character.\n\n### Geographic and Administrative Details\n- The region falls into two main French administrative départements: Charente-Maritime and Charente.\n- It is known for its natural French sea salt, butter, snails, and 'fleur de sel'.\n- The towns of Cognac and Jarnac are central in the region, with the Charente River running between them.\n\n### Cognac as a Beverage\n- Cognac is a type of brandy, specifically from the Cognac region.\n- High-quality Cognacs can be quite expensive, with some costing around $200 or more per bottle. The most expensive mentioned is the Henri IV Dudognon Heritage, aged in oak barrels for more than 100 years, costing $5,000 a bottle, uniquely packaged in a 24-karat gold-plated bottle set with diamonds.\n\n### Environmental and Climatic Influences\n- The region features a mix of maritime and continental climates and shows significant soil variation.\n- These geographic characteristics lead to the division of Cognac into six smaller subdistricts or crus, each producing Cognacs of distinctive qualities.\n\n### Classification of Crus\n- Cognacs are classified by crus: Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, and Borderies are the top three in terms of quality, in descending order.\n- 'Champagne' in Cognac has no relation to the Champagne wine region, but rather derives from the Latin word 'campagna'.\n\n### Subdistricts and Their Characteristics\n- The less highly-regarded subdistricts include Fins Bois, Bons Bois, and Bois Ordinaires, once all forested areas.\n- Grande Champagne is renowned for its chalky soil conducive to rich-tasting Cognacs.\n- The term 'Fine Champagne' refers to Cognacs made exclusively from Grande and Petite Champagne, not a separate crus.\n\nThis structured description captures the essence of the detailed information provided about the Cognac region, its economic activities related to Cognac production, and the defining characteristics of different Cognac types."

Here's a breakdown of the main topics discussed in the document:\n\n1. **Early Beginnings (1700s - 1800s):**\n   - **Fray Garcia de San Francisco y Zúñiga:** This priest played a fundamental role in cultivating the first grapevines in California, specifically a variety known as \"listán prieto,\" which was later called \"mission\" grapes. These were part of the efforts to have wine for Eucharist celebrations.\n   - **Missions and Vineyards:** Missions from Baja (\"Lower\") to Alta (\"Upper\") California were established. Each mission had its own vineyard. These vines originated from Mexico and were first brought over by Spanish settlers and explorers including Hernan Cortés.\n   - **Independence and Change:** The territory, referred to as Alta California when under Spanish and later Mexican control, was ceded to the United States in 1846 following the Mexican-American War, becoming part of the U.S. as the State of California in 1850.\n\n2. **California Gold Rush Era (Mid-1800s):**\n   - **Shift from Mining to Agriculture:** Post-Gold Rush, European immigrants turned to agriculture, including viticulture. This shift was influenced by the exhaustion of mineable gold.\n   - **Notable Figures in Viticulture:**\n     - **Agoston Haraszthy:** A Hungarian aristocrat who established Sonoma’s Buena Vista winery in 1857, making it the oldest continuously operating winery in the U.S. He was famously known as the \"Father of California Wine,\" importing numerous grape varieties.\n     - **Gustave Niebaum:** A Finnish sea captain who expanded into the wine industry after thriving in fur trading.\n\n3. **Image Description:**\n   - The image in the document shows a police officer uncovering a stash of liquor and wine in a New York hotel during the circa 1930, probably relating to Prohibition era activities.\n\nThis document provides a concise look at key historical developments that shaped California's wine industry and highlights significant contributors to the viticultural success in the region."

It covers several points:\n\n1. **Location and Scenery**: The image at the top shows a villa in Bolgheri, on the western coast of Tuscany under a moody sky, indicating a notable wine region.\n\n2. **Historical Challenges**: Post-war economic measures led to an increase in funds for agricultural development which were utilized to expand Chianti vineyards. To quickly meet the demand for affordable Chianti, numerous vineyards were planted with different types of Sangiovese grapes, including varieties from the neighboring Emilia-Romagna, which were not typically known for producing premium red wine.\n\n3. **Decline in Quality**: This rapid expansion and the use of unsuitable clonal types, combined with overproduction and the use of weaker, less flavorful white grapes significantly compromised the quality of Chianti wine. \n\n4. **Perception and Marketing**: By the 1970s, the allure of Chianti wine was largely associated with its packaging, notably the straw-covered bottles, rather than the quality of the wine itself. This reflects a broader trend of marketing influencing consumer perception of wine quality.\n\n5. **Cultural Reference**: The narrative points towards a shift from the authentic quality of the wine to a more superficial appeal based on romance and marketing. The description indicates a move away from the traditional heritage and quality that Chianti once represented.\n\nThis document outlines critical issues faced by the Italian wine industry in the late 20th century, such as the tension between quantity versus quality and the impact of marketing on the legacy of historical wine regions."

Here’s the structured content of the discussed sections:\n\n### The Sources of Cheese Diversity\n- **Ingredients and Conditions Creating Diversity**: Traditional cheeses are made from a variety of hundreds of plants (ranging from scrubland herbs to alpine flowers), dozens of animals (feeding on those plants), and are transformed into milk. This milk is incorporated with protein-cutting enzymes and thistles, microbes from different environments like meadows, caves, oceans, and animal insides, and benefits from animal skins.\n- **Human Skills**: Observation, ingenuity, and good taste from generations of cheesemakers and cheese lovers have contributed to the heritage of cheese-making, which underlies even today’s simplified industrial cheeses.\n- **System of Organization**: Cheeses are organized into a comprehensible system based on moisture content, which affects the ripening duration and the flavor development of the cheese.\n\n### Cheese Flavors from Proteins and Fats\n- **Process of Flavor Development**: \n  - Enzymes from milk and rennet along with microbes break down concentrated protein and fat into a wide range of flavor compounds.\n  - Proteins such as casein are broken into pieces called peptides and eventually into amino acids. These acids can further degrade into a variety of more savory or sweet-smelling components.\n  - Fats are broken down into fatty acids by enzymes and particular microbes (like Penicillium roqueforti). Some enzymes are added to specific cheeses like Pecorino and Provolone to intensify certain flavors or aromas.\n- **Components Contributing to Flavor**:\n  - Volatile fatty acids transform into ketones which intensify the moldy (cheesy) aroma.\n  - Copper cauldrons used in the making of cheeses like Swiss and Parmesan can damage some milk fat directly and enrich the aroma.\n  - Esters, which are derivatives from interactions between fatty acids and alcohols, add exotic aromas like pineapple and coconut.\n\n### Choosing, Storing, and Serving Cheese\n- **Historical Context**: Choosing a good cheese has always been complex and important, as indicated by an old medieval compendium of maximums and recipes taught to Charlemagne, emphasizing the significance and detailed knowledge involved in handling cheese."

    "contenu": "The text discusses various aspects of chocolate including its types, storage, production methods, and its cooling effect when consumed. Here's the structured content presented in the excerpt:\n\n### Types of Chocolate\n- **White Chocolate**: Described as chocolate-less chocolate because it contains no cocoa particles or chocolate flavor. It's made from a mixture of purified, usually deodorized cocoa butter, milk solids, and sugar. It contrasts with ordinary chocolate and has a relatively short shelf life at room temperature.\n\n### Packaging Innovations in Chocolate\n- Some manufacturers are experimenting with packaging nibs or small pieces of roasted beans, which offer intense flavor. Whole roasted beans can also be found in Latin markets.\n\n### Storage and Fat Bloom in Chocolate\n- **Ideal Storage Temperature**: 60–65°F (15–18°C). This helps prevent melting and recrystallization of cocoa butter fats, which can lead to a fat bloom.\n- **Fat Bloom**: Explained as a powdery-looking coating due to melted cocoa butter that has migrated to the surface, forming new crystals. This is generally prevented by proper tempering and can be slowed by adding substances like clarified butter, which randomizes the fat molecule formation.\n\n### Cocoa Powder\n- Cocoa powder is made from cake residues left after extracting most of the cocoa butter. It remains coated with a thin layer of cocoa butter and contains about 8 to 26% of this solid content. It's characterized by a strong flavor and pronounced acidity, having a pH of around 5.\n\n### Dutch Process Cocoa\n- Known as \"Dutched\" or alkalized cocoa, particularly common in Europe and the U.S. This method involves treating cocoa beans with an alkaline substance like potassium carbonate, which was pioneered by a Dutch chocolate manufacturer. This process raises the pH and alters the chemical composition of the beans.\n\n### Chocolate's Cooling Effect\n- Well-made chocolate has a unique property of feeling cool in the mouth. This is because it melts slightly below body temperature, and its solid phase absorbs heat energy from the mouth without significantly raising the temperature of the chocolate itself."

    "contenu": "# THE RHÔNE\n\nIf I had to name France’s three greatest regions, I would say: Bordeaux (for the aristocracy of the best wines made there); Burgundy (for what it teaches us about elegance in wine); and the Rhône (for the uninhibited, fearless, almost savage flavors that the top wines possess). There is no question that among the world’s greatest red wines, Rhônes are the most untamed. Their howlingly spicy, dark flavors can seem almost caged, ready to explode with fierceness. Rhônes are the wine equivalent of a primal scream.\n\nThe Rhône Valley takes its name from the Rhône River, which begins high in the Swiss Alps and flows into France through the canyons of the Jura Mountains. South of Lyon and just north of Ampuis, where the vineyards begin, the river makes a sharp turn and plunges southward for 250 miles (400 kilometers) until it washes into the Mediterranean, just west of Marseille.\n\nThe valley is divided into two parts: the northern Rhône, smaller and a bit more prestigious, and the southern Rhône, larger and better known. It takes about an hour to drive between the two, and along the way, you see only patches of isolated vineyards. In fact, the northern and southern Rhône are so distinct and different that, were it not for the river that connects them, they would almost certainly be considered separate wine regions.\n\nIn both the north and the south there are multiple wine districts, or appellations. The most renowned northern reds are Côte-Rôtie and Hermitage; the most famous southern red is Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The popular, well-priced wines known as Côtes-du-Rhône—staples in French cafés and many others worldwide—can come from either part of the valley, although most come from tracts of vineyards in the south.\n\n### THE QUICK SIP ON THE RHÔNE\n\nTHE RHÔNE VALLEY in southeastern France is divided into two parts: the northern Rhône and the southern Rhône. Wines from each are distinctly different.\n\nRED WINES DOMINATE THE REGION, although whites and rosés are also made in the Rhône. The most famous northern Rhône reds are Côte-Rôtie and Hermitage; the most famous southern red is Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nSYRAH IS THE SOLE RED GRAPE in the north. Southern Rhône reds are usually blends of many grapes, the most important of which are grenache and mourvèdre.\n\nAlthough twenty-seven varieties of grapes are grown in the Rhône Valley, only a handful of these are of major importance. The others—many of them grapes that have grown in the Rhône for centuries and are simply inter-planted with the main varieties—are today used almost nostalgically, to add nuance and what winemakers sometimes call the flavors of tradition. As a matter of law, each appellation specifies which of the twenty-seven grapes can be used within its borders (see The Major Appellations, Wines, and Principal Grapes of the Northern Rhône, page 241, and The Major Appellations, Wines, and Principal Grapes of the Southern Rhône, page 249).

    "contenu": "The document titled \"SUGAR CANDIES AND CONFECTIONERY\" deals with various properties and behaviors of sugar in candy making processes including the boiling of syrup and its concentration as well as a traditional method known as the cold-water test that evaluates sugar syrup concentrations. Here’s a structural breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Document Title\n**SUGAR CANDIES AND CONFECTIONERY**\n\n### Content Sections\n\n#### 1. Boiling Point and Sugar Concentration\n- The section discusses how the boiling point of sugar syrup increases as the concentration of dissolved material in the syrup (such as sugar) increases. It mentions a specific example: a syrup that boils at 250°F/125°C is approximately 90% sugar by weight.\n\n#### 2. Cooking the Syrup Raises the Sugar Concentration\n- As water in a sugar solution boils away, the concentration of sugar increases. This causes a continuous rise in the syrup's boiling point. To achieve a syrup of specific sugar concentration, one must heat a mixture of sugar and water until it boils and maintain that boiling state.\n\n#### 3. Specific Boiling Points and Sugar Concentrations\n- At various sugar concentrations, the boiling point of the syrup differs significantly: \n  - 235°F/113°C for about 85% sugar (used for sauces and taffy)\n  - 270°F/132°C for about 90% sugar (used for fudge)\n  - 300°F/149°C and above, nearing 100% sugar (used for brittles and hard candies)\n\n#### 4. The Cold-Water Test\n- Describes a traditional method used by confectioners involving cooling a small sample of syrup quickly and observing its behavior in cold water to estimate its concentration. Thinner syrups form a thread, while more concentrated syrups form a pliable ball in cold water.\n\n### Accompanying Graph\n- Title: **Syrup Boiling Points Depend on Sugar Concentration**\n- Description: A graphical representation showing how the boiling point of a sugar solution increases with the concentration of sugar. Percentages range from 0% to 100%, with corresponding boiling points ranging from just above 200°F to 340°F as concentration increases.\n\n### Graph Data\nThe graph plots the boiling points in degrees Fahrenheit against the percent sugar by weight as follows:\n- Starts from just above 200°F at 0% sugar\n- Gradually rises with increasing sugar concentration\n- Shows a steep increase past about 60% sugar, reaching up to 340°F at 100% sugar\n\n--- \n\nThis document is primarily informative, providing detailed insights into the behavioral characteristics of sugar syrups used in confectionery, including practical aspects such as how to cook syrups to desired sugar concentrations and how to quickly estimate sugar concentration using the cold-water test."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n**Valdo’s Numero 10 and Bellanda’s SC 1931**, but they are the exceptions, because aging the wine in bottles suppresses the primary-fruit character that is the hallmark of this wine.\nMany winemakers employ only the Prosecco grape in their wines, though the law requires only 85 percent Prosecco, with the balance made up of the early-ripening Bianchetta, the aromatic Perera, and the sharp and acidic Verdiso. The blend is less critical than the final style of the wine, which falls into one of three categories of sweetness: brut (driest), extra dry, and dry (sweetest). As with Champagne, there’s some overlap in the sugar levels in these categories, so you can theoretically have a brut that’s sweeter than an extra dry. I discuss below how to pair these different categories with food.\n\nProsecco’s charm, like that of Asti, is the freshness of its fruit. It’s best to drink it soon rather than to cellar it as you might a good bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine. Unless you are having a party or hedging the value of the euro, there’s no need to stash cases in your basement. For similar reasons, it’s probably not worth hunting for vintage-dated Prosecco. Although most Prosecco is made from the wine of a single harvest, it’s rarely vintage-dated. It’s best for the wine (and for the winery’s finances) to get the bottles to market as quickly as possible. When wineries do produce a vintage-dated Prosecco, the primary reason is so that they can charge more for it, trading on the popular assumption that a vintage wine is always better and worth a higher price. With Prosecco, this isn’t the case.\n\n### Pairing with Food\n\nIf ever a wine was created to harmonize with the food of its home region, it is Prosecco. It pairs beautifully with the famed specialties of the Veneto, especially wild game, spit- or oven-roasted or cooked into stews accompanied by polenta. Further enriching the local cuisine are mushrooms: porcini (or *cepes*, as the French call them), the *chiodino* or honey mushroom, and various members of the chanterelle family. These mushrooms are often paired with sweet chestnuts. The fleshiness of the mushrooms and the texture and sweetness of the chestnuts enhance the fruit character of the Prosecco.\n\nDon't think of Prosecco as a cheap alternative to Champagne. Prosecco shares Champagne’s bubbles and food-friendliness but little else. Champagne is all about toast and chalk, lean citrus, and long, expansive finishes. Many of its complex signature notes derive from autolysis, the process of the spent yeast breaking down in the bottle after secondary fermentation. Prosecco is more about a balance of ripe fruit and sweetness than about complexity and nuance.\n\nI’d guess that most Prosecco is enjoyed at the beginning of a meal, a decision that suits the wine just fine. It’s very good with snack foods, from roasted almonds to Chex Mix (really!), and from sweeter sushi to basic antipasti or salumi. You've got a wide choice of appetizers, too, as Prosecco is a solid match with dishes ranging from crab and shrimp salads to Chinese potstickers.\n\n---"

Older vintages may carry former names, tokay or tokay-pinot gris.\n   \n6. **RIESLING**\n   - **Description**: Considered the most prestigious grape in Alsace, capable of remarkable complexity and aging potential, also suitable for late-harvest wines.\n   \n7. **SYLVANER**\n   - **Description**: A minor grape capable of making very good wines in Alsace, particularly when the sylvaner vines are old; identical to the grape silvaner in Germany.\n\n### RED\n1. **PINOT NOIR**\n   - **Description**: Alsace's only red grape, minor but capable of producing fascinating wine occasionally.\n\n### Additional Explanation on GEWÜRZTRAMINER\n- Explanation discusses the polarizing nature of gewürztraminer (compared to nebbiolo). It highlights its heritage, its robust flavors ranging from lychee to marmalade, and its growing conditions primarily in Alsace and occasionally in Italy’s Trentino-Alto Adige region. Gewürztraminer is pointed out as a mutation of the ancient grape savagnin, rooted in northeastern France and southwestern Germany. The wine's acidic balance is highlighted as crucial for maintaining its bold flavor, particularly in the vendange tardive (late harvest) style, which can be especially impactful."

    "contenu": "### Spicing\n\nThe spicing of fermented vegetables is highly versatile. Vegetables can be fermented without any spices, with a mild spice level, or with a strong spice intensity, depending on personal preference. Here are some traditional and non-traditional ways various cultures incorporate spices into their fermented vegetables:\n\n- **Kimchi** (Korean): Typically uses hot peppers, ginger, garlic, onions, scallions, shallots, or leeks. The hot pepper can be added as a powder, flakes, or fresh.\n- **Sauerkraut** (German): Traditionally spiced with juniper berries. Other common herbs include caraway, dill, and celery seeds.\n- **Curtido** (El Salvador): Typically seasoned with oregano and hot pepper.\n\n#### Functional Role of Spices:\nMost traditional spices that are used in fermentation serve as mold inhibitors. This doesn’t necessarily prevent mold but slows its growth considerably under similar conditions.\n\n- **Mold Inhibition Example**: If two identical crocks of vegetables are fermented under the same conditions but one has spices, the spiced batch is likely to develop mold slower than the unspiced batch.\n- **Natural Spicy Ferment Ingredient**: Nasturtium leaves have also been noted for their spicy flavor and potential mold inhibiting properties.\n\n#### Deviating from Tradition:\n\n- **Turmeric**: Known for its vibrant color and plethora of health benefits, including antioxidant, antiviral, and other medicinal properties.\n- **Cumin and Oregano**: These spices can be particularly appealing in ferments. Cumin is noted for adding a lovely essence, while lightly toasted oregano offers a burst of flavor.\n- **Additional Spices**: Many people enjoy adding black pepper, coriander, fennel, fenugreek, and mustard seeds to their fermentations.\n- **Fresh Herbs**: Even though fresh herbs are volatile and might not last through long fermentations, they can be delightful in shorter ones.\n\nThe advice is to be adventurous with spices in fermentation as it usually enhances flavor, inhibits mold growth, and can introduce health benefits, making each batch unique and tailored to personal tastes."

    "contenu": "### CEREAL DOUGHS AND BATTERS\n\n#### Historical Bread Preferences Across Different Eras\n\n- **Ancient Greek Era:**\n  - Greeks valued bread made with flavors such as honey, anise, sesame, and fruits.\n  - Predominantly whole-grain or partly refined breads.\n  - Significant influence from Archestratus, the contemporary of Aristotle, who favored barley bread from Lesbos known for its purity.\n\n- **Late Roman Times:**\n  - Central to life was wheat bread.\n  - Large quantities of durum and bread wheats were imported from northern Africa and other parts of the Roman Empire to meet public demand.\n  - Enriched breads, like early cakes and pastries, were considered luxuries during these often turbulent times.\n\n#### The Middle Ages\n- **Bread Production:**\n  - Bakers specialized mainly in either common brown or luxurious white bread.\n  - Improvements in milling techniques and per capita income influenced the availability and dissolution of traditional bread guilds.\n  \n- **Common Bread Types:**\n  - In northern regions, breads from rye, barley, and oats were more prevalent.\n  - Coarser and heavier breads were favored, including a notable type called the \"trencher.\" \n  - Trenchers were dense, dry bread slices used as plates in medieval meals, edible wrappings for meat, or given to the poor and were a part of all-purpose kitchen utility.\n\n#### Technology Evolution: Milling\n- **Historic Mills:**\n  - Initial mills like the saddlestone and lever mill were limited in efficiency due to their movement mechanics.\n  - The advent of the hourglass mill, turned continuously by manual or animal forces, significantly improved grain milling.\n  - These advances allowed for the use of more powerful mills, including water and wind-driven variants.\n\n- **Modern Milling:**\n  - Currently, grain is primarily milled using metal rollers with grooved surfaces, although some stone-ground methods are still in practice.\n\nThis document summarizes the evolution and cultural significance of bread and milling technologies from ancient Greece through Roman times to the Middle Ages, illustrating the technological and social changes that influenced culinary practices."

Here's the detailed content structured according to the document:\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\nThe document opens by talking about the diversity and specific flavors of different brands of orange bitters, such as Regans’, House Peychaud’s, and Angostura, highlighting how each contributes unique flavors to enhance a drink. It then introduces the main categorization of bitters into lifting bitters and binding bitters.\n\n### Lifting Bitters\nLifting bitters are described as ingredients that heighten and brighten similar flavors in a drink, often having a simpler flavor profile focused on one or two main ingredients. Examples include:\n- Bittercube cherry bark and vanilla bitters\n- Bitter Truth celery bitters\n- Bittermens ’Elemakule Tiki bitters\n- Bittermens hopped grapefruit bitters\n- Bittermens Hellfire habanero shrub\n- House Orange Bitters\n\n### Binding Bitters\nBinding bitters are more complex in formula and aim to connect disjointed ingredients in a drink, rescuing and enhancing muddy flavor profiles. They are exemplified by:\n- Angostura bitters\n- Bittermens Xocolatl mole bitters\n- Bitter Truth aromatic bitters\n- Bitter Truth Jerry Thomas’ bitters\n- Fee Brothers whiskey barrel–aged bitters\n- House Orange Bitters\n\nBoth categories provide essential roles in drink making, enhancing flavors and bringing together diverse ingredients to create balanced cocktails.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "### CHÂTEAUNEUF-DU-EXTRATERRESTRIAL\n\nThe vintners of Châteauneuf-du-Pape have always been fastidious when it comes to creating laws that will protect their vineyards. In a legendary 1954 municipal decree, they mandated the following:\n\n**ARTICLE 1.** The flying overhead, landing, and taking off of aeronautical machines called “flying saucers” or “flying cigars,” of whatever nationality they may be, is strictly forbidden on the territory of the commune of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\n**ARTICLE 2.** Any aeronautical machine—“flying saucer” or “flying cigar”—that lands on the territory of the commune will be immediately taken off to the jail. (No joke.)\n\n### THE NAME CHÂTEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE\n\nChâteauneuf-du-Pape, “new castle of the pope,” refers to the time in the fourteenth century when the pope resided not in Rome but in the walled city of Avignon, just south of these vineyards. (At the time, what we call Châteauneuf-du-Pape was called Châteauneuf-Calcernier, after a nearby village and its limestone quarry.) The pope who instigated this startling change in residence was the Frenchman Clement VI in Bordeaux, Château Pape-Clément is named after him. Later, his successor, John XXII, built a new papal summer home out among the vineyards. It wasn’t until the twentieth century, after vast improvements were made in the vineyards and winemaking, that the new name Châteauneuf-du-Pape took hold. Today most bottles of estate-grown Châteauneuf-du-Pape are embossed with the papal crown and St. Peter’s keys, as an acknowledgment of the region’s holy history.\n\n### SOIL COMPOSITION\n\nOf all the things that set Châteauneuf apart, the most startling is its “soil” composed largely of smooth, rolled stones. They are everywhere. Many vineyards are simply vast rock beds with no visible dirt whatsoever. The stones and rocks—known as galets—which range from fist-size to the size of a small pumpkin, are the remnants of ancient Alpine glaciers. The withrawal of these glaciers, along with temperature increases, ripped quartzite off the flanks of the Alps. Over many millennia, these chunks of quartzite were rolled, broken, and rounded by the tumultuous waters of the then larger Rhône River. As the river receded, the stones were left scattered over the plateaus and terraces. Although there is soil underneath the stones, varying from clay to sandy limestone to gravel, the land is extremely difficult to work, and tending the vineyards is a painstakingly slow process.\n\n### CLIMATE AND WINE PRODUCTION\n\nWhat southern Rhône vineyards do not lack is heat. Unfortunately, the stones retain this heat and therefore hasten ripening. At the same time, however, the stones protect the ground from becoming parched and dry and help hold moisture in the soil, a boon for the vines, especially as summer proceeds.\n\n### WINE VARIETIES\n\nApproximately 95 percent of Châteauneuf-du-Pape is red, although there are white and rosé wines. The grapes that can be used are the so-called Châteauneuf thirteen (actually fourteen)—eight reds and six whites. Almost no producer other than Château de Beaucastel grows and makes wine from the whole gamut. The majority of Châteauneufs are based on grenache grown until it is sweetly ripe and tasting like homemade jam. Blended into the grenache are syrah, to deepen the color and add spice, as well as mourvèdre, which adds structure. Other red grapes may play a role, too, but none are as important as these three.\n\n### TOP WHITE WINES\n\nAmong the top Châteauneuf-du-Pape whites are two from Château de Beaucastel: their leading wine, known as Cuvée Classique, and the rarer Vieilles Vignes (remarkably, made from 100% Roussanne grapes)."

    "contenu": "### WHY IS WHITE WINE WHITE AND RED WINE RED?\n\nWhile starting this section with the question above might seem almost too basic, over the years I’ve found that most people don’t get the answer quite right. It isn’t just “because of the skins.”\n\nThe juice of all grapes, red and white, is almost colorless (with a few rare exceptions). Thus, red skins alone do not make red wine red. The big difference between red wine and white wine is this: For red wine, the juice is **fermented** with the red grape skins. During fermentation, heat and alcohol are generated. Both are solvents that help leach out the reddish-purple color pigments from the skins, tinting the surrounding wine. In the absence of this heat and alcohol, “red” wine in a fermentation vessel would actually be a pinkish liquid with red skins floating around in it.\n\nWith white wine, the skins aren’t necessary to tint the juice (it’s already clear), plus the skins might add tannin, an undesirable element in white wine. So, in making white wine, the skins are quickly separated from the juice **before** the juice is fermented."

Margulis explains that kefir grains involve a community of 30 different types of microbes, including common food fermentation favorites, such as Lactobacilli, Leuconostoc, Acetobacter, and Saccharomyces, as well as others more obscure; in fact, according to Margulis, fewer than half the microbes involved are known or named.

Direct addition will cause instant curdling which reduces mix effectiveness.\n   - Optionally, add citric acid or lemon juice gradually to avoid sudden curdling.\n   - Stir gently to avoid breaking up curds too much which complicates straining later.\n\n3. **Handling the Mixture Post-Addition of Acid:**\n   - After milk breaks, small clouds of tan curds will be visible.\n   - If observed closely, the vodka remains slightly cloudy due to casein that hasn’t bonded with curds.\n   - Gently stir to mop up excess casein, enhancing vodka clarity and curd distinction.\n   - Allow vodka to sit undisturbed for several hours before final straining.\n   - Strain curds using a fine filter or coffee filter or use a centrifuge for faster results. \n\n**Recommendation:**\n   - The document defines the detailed procedure for infusing tea into vodka and then mixing it with milk to create a clear vodka product, emphasizing gradual acid addition and careful handling to maintain clarity and prevent over-curdling."

    "contenu": "**AMERICA'S FINEST BRANDY**\n\nIn 1982, American Ansley Coale and Frenchman Hubert Germain-Robin founded the artisanal distillery Germain-Robin near the town of Ukiah, in Mendocino. Today, Germain-Robin's brandies are considered the best brandies made in the United States and have, in multiple blind tastings, repeatedly bested a host of Cognacs.\n\nTo make these brandies, Hubert Germain-Robin, a master Cognac distiller whose family has produced Cognac since 1782, uses an antique alembic still. Each year, he hand-distills eighty barrels of brandy from such premium grapes as pinot noir and sauvignon blanc (in Cognac and elsewhere in Europe, brandies are usually distilled from lesser grape varieties). Of the five brandies Germain-Robin makes, the most stunning is the XO Reserve, a brandy so smooth, elegant, and lush it can leave you speechless.\n\n**MENDOCINO'S WINERIES**\n\nMendocino’s jagged, almost menacing coastline has been carved out over eons by icy, dark-blue waters. Farther inland, in the middle of Lake County, the grand body of water known as Clear Lake is the largest natural lake in California. On any given day in these two regions you’re more likely to see a whale, mountain lion, or rattlesnake than someone in a business suit. Indeed, when the sixties ended in San Francisco, some “flower children” simply dropped out of city life and moved north to the backwoods of Mendocino (today, besides grapes, marijuana is a popular crop). In this section, the focus is on Mendocino, the more significant of the two wine regions. Lake County is addressed below.\n\nThe first small wineries in Mendocino were established in the 1850s by failed prospectors turned farmers, in the wake of the Gold Rush. But by the end of Prohibition, virtually every winery had disappeared, and pear orchards or nut trees stood where vineyards had once flourished. The two counties, so rugged and remote, were not quick to be reborn as wine regions. As of 1967, there was only one winery in Mendocino (Parducci), even though the wine business was beginning to take off in both Napa and Sonoma. The next year, however, proved to be a turning point. In 1968, Mendocino’s Fetzer Vineyards was founded by lumber executive Barney Fetzer. Fetzer’s growth was meteoric. During the decade of the 1980s, ten of Barney Fetzer’s eleven children built the family winery into one of the largest in California. Although Fetzer Vineyards is now owned by Chile’s huge wine firm Concha y Toro, the Fetzer family continues to hold prime vineyard land in Mendocino."

    "contenu": "**Title: BORDEAUX**\n\nBordeaux—the word alone fires the mind with the anticipation of greatness. No other wine region is more powerful, more commercially successful, or more important as a source of profoundly complex, ageworthy wines. The challenge is to comprehend it all, for this single region—the largest Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée in France—covers more territory than all of the vineyard areas of Germany put together, and is three and a half times larger than the vineyard acreage of New Zealand. In Bordeaux, some 8,650 growers and dozens of top-class estates—plus thousands more of lesser standing—produce more than 661 million bottles of wine every year, including many of the priciest wines in the world.\n\nWhile it makes stunning, long-lived white table wines and superb white sweet wines (notably, Sauternes), Bordeaux is primarily a red-wine region. Nearly 90 percent of the wine made is red.\n\n**Sidebar**:\nThe name Bordeaux derives from *au bord de l'eau*, meaning “along the waters.” Bordeaux lies within the French region of Aquitaine, a word whose Latin roots mean a well-watered place.\n\nThe range of red Bordeaux is astounding. At the most basic level there are scores of utterly simple Bordeaux selected, by the case, on the floor of any large wine shop. Wines labeled simply Bordeaux or Bordeaux Supérieur fall into this category, and they can cost $20 a bottle or so. At the most rarefied level, however, the famous Bordeaux we all hear about—the First Growths and wines in their league—can be the apotheosis of refinement. While these wines represent just a fraction of all of the Bordeaux produced, their complexity and age-worthiness are legendary. As are their astronomical prices. Indeed, by 2013, the First Growths and wines in their orbit often cost up to $1,500 a bottle (and sometimes more) for current vintages. This has effectively (and sadly) removed them from the wine-drinking experiences of all but the most well-connected, high-net-worth wine lovers. A generation ago, an upper-middle-class person—say, a university professor—could have saved up and splurged on a First Growth once a year. Today, top Bordeaux exist in their own realm, far outside the culture of normal wine drinking."

The Okanagan Valley enjoys lots of sunshine, sparse rainfall, and cool nights, making it ideal for viticulture.\n2. **Etymology of Okanagan**:\n   - Historians suggest \"Okanagan\" might mean \"rendezvous\", referring to Lake Osoyoos as a gathering place for Native Americans of Washington and British Columbia.\n   - A local legend indicates \"Okanagan\" means \"big head\", referring to an ancient native people known for exceptional bravery.\n3. **Geology and Geography**:\n    - Okanagan Lake, which was formed by receding glaciers, is long, narrow, and very deep, exceeding the depth of the Grand Canyon in some places.\n    - The valley supports fruitful agriculture with orchards and vineyards thriving on \"benches\" created by glacial scouring.\n4. **Agricultural Practice**:\n   - The valley's dry summers and overall warm climate suit a variety of fruits, including grapes used for making British Columbia’s signature pinot noirs and rieslings.\n   - Despite the northern latitude, the long growing season ensures that the wines maintain a complex flavor profile without becoming over-ripe.\n\nThese regions show how diverse geographical and climatic elements influence viticulture, turning less obvious locations into favorable wine-producing areas."

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Climate and Grape Varieties**:\n   - **Climate**: Regions in Australia feature a Mediterranean-like climate, creating a conducive environment for grape cultivation.\n   - **Grapes**: The document highlights that Australia is known for both dry riesling, a cool-climate grape, and cabernet sauvignon, a warmer-climate grape. Harvest occurs from February to May.\n\n2. **Image Description**:\n   - The image includes a caption mentioning \"A cherished old vine which is probably the oldest cabernet sauvignon vineyard in the world—Penfolds's legendary Block 42 in the Barossa Valley.\"\n\n3. **Agricultural Challenges**:\n   - **Natural Challenges**: Vineyards face issues like rot, frost, drought, and strong, salt-laden winds.\n   - **Animals**: Kangaroos pose challenges by feeding on vine leaves and buds. High fences with barbed wire are used to protect the vineyards.\n\n4. **Labor and Mechanization**:\n   - Due to a limited population and a shortage of harvest workers, Australian viticulture heavily relies on mechanical means. Processes like picking, pruning, and spraying are mostly mechanized. Some vineyards, especially the prestigious ones, still involve manual labor by Southeast Asian field workers.\n\n5. **Focus on Riesling**:\n   - **History and Preference**: Riesling has been in Australia since the 1840s, preceding chardonnay. It's considered one of the two greatest white wines of Australia, alongside sémillon.\n   - **Geographical Regions**: Top riesling wines mainly come from Eden Valley or Clare Valley, the latter named after County Clare in Ireland.\n\nThe document provides an insightful look into the balance between traditional wine-making practices and modern challenges, particularly emphasizing the role of climatic diversity and mechanization in shaping the Australian wine industry."

    "contenu": "## Plantain\n\nThe plantain shares many characteristics of its close relative, the sweet Cavendish banana (see page 340), but mature plantains have a milder flavour than bananas, with a sweet-savoury taste that lends itself well to dessert applications.\n\nPlantains contain much more starch than sugar and are always cooked before they are eaten – they are typically fried, baked, grilled or mashed. The high level of starch, which peaks while the fruit is still green, makes plantains a staple food in many countries. As the fruit ripens, its skin turns from green to yellow to almost black, while the starch inside is converted to sugars. Plantains are often sold green but can be used at any stage of ripeness. For maximum flavour, opt for plantains with blackened skins. They have a fruitier aroma than the banana, with less of the cloying sweetness.\n\n- In Latin America, plantains are used in a variety of different soups. Puerto Rican sopa de plátano starts with a sofrittto base of garlic, onion, tomato and chilies, to which grated plantains and vegetable broth are added, and seasoned with paprika, cumin, coriander seed, black pepper and anato oil. The soup is garnished with fresh avocado, chopped parsley, pique criollo (pickled chilies) and Parmesan, and often served with bread.\n\n- **Caldo de bolas de verde** is a beef soup from Ecuador, filled with chunks of sweetcorn, cassava and large dumplings made from mashed green plantains stuffed with minced beef, bell peppers and peas, seasoned with ground cumin. To punch up the flavour, a citrusy squeeze of lime, hot chili sauce, pickled red onions and fresh coriander are added.\n\n- Peruvian chapo is a hot drink made from boiled plantains blended with cinnamon, cloves and sugar.\n\n- Green, unripe plantains are used to make tostones, the twice-fried snacks found in Latin American and Caribbean cuisines. Peel the plantains and cut into thick slices. Fry in hot oil until just golden, then remove from the frying pan. Flatten each slice, then return to the pan and cook until golden brown. Drain the tostones on kitchen paper. Season with garlic or chili powder and salt, or add sugar and salt for a sweet version.\n\n- When making sweet tostones, mix some cardamom seeds (see page 254) into the sugar to add a refreshing, camphorous, citrusy note.\n\n## Ingredient pairings with plantain\n\n### greater plantain leaf\n| Ingredient               | hazelnut | Spanish chorizo | boiled peas | horse mackerel | spinach | pan-fried wild wood pigeon | Gorgonzola | boiled aubergine | oyster mushroom | roasted brown shrimp |\n|--------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|----------------------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| greater plantain leaf    | ⚫        | ⚫               | ⚫           | ⚫              | ⚫       | ⚫                          | ⚫          | ⚫                | ⚫               | ⚫                    |\n\n### palm sugar\n| Ingredient       | plantain | maracuja (passion fruit) | roasted peanut | poached grey mullet | pan-fried pork loin | dried porcini | beetroot | dried hibiscus flower | mascarpone | doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste) |\n|------------------|----------|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| palm sugar       | ⚫        | ⚫                        | ⚫              | ⚫                   | ⚫                   | ⚫             | ⚫        | ⚫                    | ⚫          | ⚫                                         |"

    "contenu": "The document analyzes various terms related to wine, providing definitions and contexts for each. Here it is the document content structured as a glossary in text format:\n\n---\n\n**FILTER**: A device used to remove selected particles from wine, often employed to clear out yeast cells and bacteria, enhancing taste by removing impurities but potentially stripping the wine of some flavors and textures.\n\n**FINESSE**: Refers to wines that are delicate and well-balanced, often not applicable to robust, rustic country wines but more suited to refined, sophisticated wines like Champagne or white Burgundy.\n\n**FINING**: The process of clarifying wine by introducing elements that bind to unwanted particles, making them easier to remove. Common fining agents include gelatin, egg whites, or ISINGLASS.\n\n**FINISH**: Describes the aftertaste that wine leaves, which may be affected by alcohol, acid, or tannin content. A good finish is characterized as long, lingering, and well-balanced.\n\n**FLAT**: Used to describe wines that lack acidity, resulting in a less vibrant taste experience.\n\n**FLOWERY**: A descriptive term typically applied to white wines with aromatic profiles reminiscent of flowers.\n\n**FORTIFIED**: Wine that has been enhanced in alcohol content through the addition of distilled spirits, common in varieties like Sherry or Port.\n\n**FOXY**: Describes a specific musky flavor associated with native American grape species like Vitis labrusca.\n\n**FREE RUN**: Juice that is extracted from grapes under their own weight before the application of mechanical pressing.\n\n**FRUIT**: A key component of a wine’s aroma and flavor profile, derived directly from the grapes used in its production.\n\n**FRUITY**: Describes wines with a strong, easily identifiable fruit component in their aroma or flavor.\n\n**FULL-BODIED**: Wines that exhibit significant weight and presence on the palate, often compared to lighter wines as more substantial in mouthfeel.\n\n**FUTURES**: See \"EN PRIMEUR\" in the French glossary (definition not provided in the document).\n\n**GENERIC**: Wines named after well-known regions but not legally restricted in usage, often less controlled in non-European countries.\n\n**GLYCERINE/GLYCEROL**: A minor by-product of fermentation that contributes slightly to the sweetness and smooth feel of a wine, though not significantly influencing viscosity.\n\nThe provided explanations can be useful for both wine enthusiasts and those new to the field, offering a comprehensive view on various aspects of wine terminology and production characteristics."

    "contenu": "The document is structured with two major sections that discuss different aspects related to cheese making, particularly focusing on the aging of cheese and the author's personal experience in cheese making.\n\n---\n\n**Cheese Aging Process:**\n1. **Temperature and Humidity Control:**\n   - Temperature: Around 55°F/13°C.\n   - Humidity: High enough to prevent quick drying.\n   - Impact: Dry environments lead to the cheese skin becoming brittle, potentially trapping moisture inside and making the cheese vulnerable to molding.\n\n2. **Rind Development:**\n   - Importance: Critical for aging cheese.\n   - Methods: \n     - Molds may be encouraged or introduced through culturing for mold-ripened cheeses.\n     - Natural-rind cheeses might need daily care such as rinsing with brine, wine, or adding mold inhibitors.\n     - Some cheeses are waxed after drying to protect the surfaces.\n\n3. **Variability:**\n   - Highlight: Many variables and possibilities exist in the cheese aging process, indicating that the method can vary widely depending on the type of cheese and desired outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Author’s Personal Experience:**\n1. **Past Involvement:**\n   - Reference to previous writing: \"Wild Fermentation\".\n   - Living circumstances: Lived in a community with a herd of goats.\n   - Cheese making necessity due to heavy milk flow during summers.\n   - Decline in production: Decided to scale down milk production, leading to less cheese making.\n\n2. **Current Situation:**\n   - Lack of excess milk: Buys milk from a neighbor's goat herd-share program.\n   - Self-described as an out-of-practice experimentalist in cheese making.\n\n3. **Acknowledgment of Limitations:**\n   - Recognizes the challenges and fickleness of cheese making.\n   - Admits limited experience and knowledge in advanced cheese-making.\n\n4. **Guidance Offered:**\n   - Instead of providing detailed guidance himself, plans to direct readers to existing literature on the subject.\n\n---\n\nThe document provides a nuanced understanding of cheese aging techniques and personal insights from the author, who acknowledges both the complexity of the process and his own limitations and past experiences related to cheese making."

Restaurants need to maintain a profit margin for business sustainability.\n- **Problems**: The restaurateur must set a reasonable price based on customer demographics, purchasing power, and the desire for social recognition. It queries whether to use a variable or fixed markup.\n- **Variable Margin**: The calculation formula is highlighted, which can adjust the selling price by applying different coefficients ranging from 2.5 to 5 based on the cost price excluding tax, where a higher cost implies a higher selling price. The choice of coefficient impacts whether to opt for a large and fixed margin.\n\nThis structured analysis provides a clear perspective on different pricing strategies concerning the sale of wine in a restaurant context, discussing the implications of pricing decisions based on staff compensation and tax considerations."

Garnish with the raspberries.\n\n---\n\n### Cocktail: Prima China\n**Creator:** Joaquín Simó, 2009\n\n**Background:** \nThe creator's wife is Chinese, and one of his wife’s cousins married a Mexican. The cocktail marries both cultures in one cocktail—China by way of the tea and Mexico with the tequila and bitters—and named it after his wife’s Chinese cousin (prima being Spanish for “cousin”).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 ounces Siembra Azul Añejo Tequila\n- ¾ ounce Earl Grey-infused Dolin Blanc Vermouth\n- ¼ ounce Cynar\n- 1 teaspoon Marie Brizard White Crème de Cacao\n- 1 dash Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters\n- Garnish: 1 Grapefruit Twist\n\n**Instructions:**\nStir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a coupe. Garnish with the grapefruit twist.\n\n---\n\n### Cocktail: Rebel Rebel\n**Creator:** Jillian Vose, 2013\n\n**Background:**\nThis is a drink that can easily go off the rails if you use too much of one ingredient.

    "contenu": "### WHAT ALLOWS A WINE TO LAST?\n\nIn order to withstand time and age well, wine must have the right amount of sugar, acid, or tannin. These are the three preservatives in wine. Without a significant amount of any of them, most wines are better off being drunk at the next opportunity.\n\nSugar is clearly a preservative. If you needed some honey and found a jar that had been sitting in the back of your kitchen cabinet for ten years, you’d nonetheless (rightfully) use it. (And a bottle of French Sauternes in your cellar is destined to go the long run.)\n\nLike a jar of honey, an old bottle of vinegar (acid) could always be employed in a salad dressing. Wines high in acid—German rieslings for example—have amazing aging potential.\n\nTannin is the third preservative, but since it comes from the grapes’ skins, it is a factor mainly in red wines. Yet it’s the most obvious entity in most collectors’ cellars, filled as they are with high-tannin wines such as Bordeaux, Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, and Barolo, for example.\n\n#### Caption for Image:\nTo take wine from a barrel, winemakers use a tool called a \"thief\" that can be inserted into the bung hole. A “barrel sample” is usually not fully ready to drink, but it can give the taster an inkling of the wine’s character and what’s to come."

Below is the structured content organized for clarity:\n\n### Cheeses and Pairings\n\n1. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Anchovies**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite (a type of cooked pressed cheese).\n   - Pairing: Anchovies.\n\n2. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Anis**\n   - Cheese: Le mahón from Menorca, described as a pasteurized cow's milk cheese with a salty and citrusy flavor.\n   - Pairing: Traditionally served in thin slices with oregano, olive oil, and black pepper. Noted for being consumed in the CantaI mountains in southern France. Suggested to be served with crackers that incorporate aromatics like tarragon, arnica, and gentian along with sea salt.\n\n3. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Artichaut (Artichoke)**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Preparation: Young artichokes, finely chopped and sautéed with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. The artichokes are prepared by removing all external tough leaves, and slicing them thinly almost to the base, ensuring not to cut off the base entirely.\n   - Recommendation: Serve the mixture over slices of the cheese. Topped finely with Parmesan cheese.\n\n4. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Asperge (Asparagus)**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Pairing: Asparagus, with a suggestion that folklore attributes mysterious powers to asparagus. The tips of the asparagus should be carefully prepared and served with the cheese, which is described to have a harmoniously sulfurous taste.\n\n5. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Banane (Banana)**\n   - Cheese: Comté, described as young with flavors like nutmeg, apricot dry, caramel, and sweet and sour cream.\n   - Pairing: Banana, especially recommended as a pairing because when heated with the cheese, it releases flavors that complement the nutty and spicy tastes noted in Comté. Suggested to be placed in a slice of bread (possibly of Espelette variety), baked until the cheese melts which emphasizes the distinct flavour fusion inspired by the heat of a pepper.\n\n6. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Basilic (Basil)**\n   - Location: Mention of a restaurant known as La Merenda by Dominique Le Stanc, located in Nice at the Hotel Negresco.\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Dining experience: The document describes an innovative dining setup involving minimalism and a selective menu chalked on a slate, where pesto features as a variant devoid of pine nuts, instead made with basil.\n\nEach cheese is showcased with a unique pairing, emphasizing the sensory complementations and cultural culinary practices associated with these pairings."

Here's the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n### Page Title:\nLemon\n\n### Content Description:\n#### Lemon aroma profile\nThe aroma of freshly squeezed lemon juice is primarily a mixture of citral and geranial. The lemony fragrance of these compounds is supplemented by woody-scented terpenines, which have a citrusy nuance, and pinene, which has a camphoraceous, woody, piney scent. Lemons also contain other floral, green, fruity and spicy notes (as indicated in the pairing grid). Lemon and lime have the same pH level, but we perceive lime juice (see the pairing grid on page 87) to be more refreshing due to its fresh, green, grassy notes, which are also present in the fruit's peel, and its hints of camphor and cooling mint.\n\n### Visual Aroma Wheel:\n- Citrus\n- Floral\n- Green\n- Fruity\n- Spicy\n- Resinous\n- Woody\n\n### Lemon Pairing Chart:\nThe chart compares the aroma characteristics of lemon with other foods and flavors in terms of six specific scent profiles: Citrus, Floral, Green, Spice, Resinous and Woody represented in colors (green, purple, yellow, red-brown, aqua blue, dark brown):\n\n```markdown\n| Flavor                   | Citrus    | Floral    | Green     | Spice     | Resinous  | Woody     | Camphor/Cool |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Lemon                    | ●●●●●   | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●●●     | ●       | ●●●          |\n| Cantaloupe               | ●●●       | ●●●      | ●●●●     | ●●        | ●         | ●       |              |\n| Cedar's Orange Pippin apple | ●●●●  | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●         | ●●        | ●       |              |\n| Banana                   | ●●●●      | ●●       | ●●●      | ●         |           |         |              |\n| Mace                     |           | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●●●●     | ●●●       | ●●●●    |              |\n| Oyster                   |           | ●●●●     | ●●●●●    |           |           |         | ●            |\n| Sea urchin               |           | ●●●      | ●●●●     |           |           |         |              |\n| Sumac                    | ●●        | ●●       | ●●●      | ●●●●      | ●         |         |              |\n| Dry-aged beef            |           |           | ●●●      | ●●●●●     | ●●●●      | ●●●●    | ●            |\n| Chicory (Belgian endive) |           | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●        | ●●      | ●●            |\n```\n\nNote: Each colored dot represents the strength or presence of the respective scent profile, with more dots indicating a stronger presence. \n\nThis structured summary provides insight into various flavor characteristics and how they compare to the aroma of lemon."

La protection de la vigne contre les gelées futures est assurée par la buttage (butte de terre placée au pied de chaque cep) et par l'herbe présente autour des pieds qui offre une bonne protection thermique.\n\n2. **Novembre à Mi-Mars:**\n   - **Activity:** Les sarments sont taillés.\n   - **Details:** Ce travail permet d'améliorer la production et la qualité des vignes. C'est une tâche pénible, longue et minutieuse. La palissage est également entrepris pour conserver les rameaux conservés lors de la taille.\n\n3. **Mi-Mars:**\n   - **Activity:** Le cycle végétatif redémarre.\n   - **Details:** La sève monte et s'unit à travers les plaies de taille : la vigne \"pleure\". Les bourgeons apparaissent et sont prêts à éclore, c'est le débourrement. Les gelées nocturnes peuvent compromettre la récolte en brûlant ces bourgeons.\n\n4. **Avril:**\n   - **Activity:** Développement des bourgeons et croissance des rameaux.\n   - **Details:** La croissance des rameaux est très rapide (près de 15 cm par jour). Les meilleurs rameaux sont sélectionnés et attachés au palissage. Les autres sont supprimés lors de l'ébourgeonnage. Les embryons de grappes qui apparaissent sont traités contre les maladies et les insectes nuisibles. Les rameaux sont relevés et palissés régulièrement puis écmés ou rogna. La vigne est déchaussée afin d'aplanir le plan de travail et d'enlever les mauvaises herbes. L'utilisation de cavillonneuse et parfois la main à l'aide d'un tire-cavillon pour retirer les cavillons (reste de terre entre les pieds de vigne).\n\nThis structured format provides an outline of the document’s content focused specifically on the vineyard work throughout different times of the year, highlighting major tasks and their purposes."

A *lieu-dit* is usually tiny (smaller than an appellation or AOC) and usually not inhabited. Sometimes the *lieu-dit* appears on the wine’s label along with the AOC. *Lieux-dits* do not necessarily carry a rank, such as Premier or Grand Cru.\n\nThe term *climat* is sometimes used interchangeably with *lieu-dit*, but the two are actually slightly different. A *climat* is a specific parcel within a vineyard that has unique terroir characteristics. Most *climats* are within classified vineyards. For example, the Grand Cru vineyard Clos de Vougeot has sixteen *climats* that make it up. The name of a *climat* may appear on the label, as is the case with the seven *climats* that make up the single vineyard Chablis Grand Cru (see Chablis, page 212)."

If a wine has gone through its aging process and is close to the end of its optimal drinking window, with further changes unlikely to be positive, it should be classified as ‘**drink now: not suitable for ageing or further ageing**.’\n   - The document mentions that if the wine has declined to the point where negative changes dominate, making the wine less enjoyable, it is considered ‘**too old**.’\n\nThis insight helps consumers and wine enthusiasts make informed decisions about when to drink or age wines based on their present qualities and anticipated future development."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the use of fining agents in the wine-making process, focusing on how these substances help to clarify wine by removing suspended proteins. Below is an outlined summary of the document’s content:\n\n1. **Types of Fining Agents:**\n   - **Egg Whites**: Protein coagulants, used to attach to the tannin and suspended particles.\n   - **Casein**: A milk protein, serves a similar function to egg whites.\n   - **Gelatin**: Made from skin, tendon, and muscle, used for fining.\n   - **Isinglass**: A gelatinous substance derived from the air bladders of sturgeon, also used for fining.\n\n2. **Functioning of Fining Agents:**\n   - The fining agents work by attaching to tannin and other particles in the wine similar to the mechanism of a Velcro patch, allowing them to be removed easily.\n\n3. **Process Description:**\n   - The fining agent is stirred into the wine, binds with the particles and settles at the bottom of the barrel. The clear wine can then be siphoned off.\n\n4. **Influence on Wine Flavor:**\n   - The flavor of the wine can be impacted by the type of fining agent used as each agent contributes different flavors due to the variety of protein molecules they consist of. \n   - For instance, wines fined with egg whites may taste different from those fined with gelatin.\n\n5. **Specific Uses:**\n   - **Egg Whites**: Notably used in Bordeaux wines, excellent for pulling out excessive tannin.\n\n6. **Activated Carbon as a Fining Agent:**\n   - Derived from charcoal, used for removing extensive impurities.\n   - Leaves the wine neutral in smell and taste, often used in extreme situations like smoke taint from forest fires.\n\n7. **Limitations and Extreme Uses:**\n   - Activated carbon is typically reserved for severe cases such as wines affected by smoke taint, which has been a significant issue in the past decade especially in regions prone to massive forest fires.\n\nThis structured content highlights the different fining agents, their roles, and impact on wine, along with a specific focus on the challenges and use of activated carbon in crisis scenarios."

This fermented rice then serves as a starter culture for bokashi fermentation of food wastes.\n   - **Protection**: The setup incorporates materials to protect against moisture and rodents.\n\n2. **Biodynamic Preparations**:\n   - **Description**: Biodynamic growers use diverse preparations known as \"preps,\" involving the fermentation of organic materials in specific ways. Examples include stuffing cow horns with manure from lactating cows, which are buried from fall to spring, and filling a stag’s bladder with yarrow flowers.\n   - **Procedure**: After fermentation, a small amount of the biodynamic preparation is stirred in water for an hour following a specific stirring pattern to energize and oxygenate it, enhancing the growth of aerobic organisms. The preps are then applied directly to plants, gardens, or compost.\n    \n3. **Fermenting Urine**:\n   - **Description**: This section introduces another fermentation process focused on urine, noting it as a simple technique to enhance soil fertility. However, the specific details of the process are not provided in this part of the document.\n\nEach outlined method aims to utilize natural processes to boost soil fertility, emphasizing a sustainable and ecological approach to agriculture."

Over the years, Oregon has shifted away from using California and France as models and has developed a new, independent approach that focuses on the unique demands of its terroir.\n\n3. **Quality of Wine:**\n   - This new approach and the adaptation to the geographic and climatic peculiarities have led to a significant improvement in the quality of Oregon wines, making them particularly noted for their beauty, focus, and finesse. Oregon Pinot Noir, in particular, is highlighted for its exceptional quality.\n\n4. **Regulations - The Ninety Percent Law:**\n   - Oregon enforces stricter wine regulations than the national standards set by U.S. law. The state requires that the leading Oregon wine types—Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Pinot Gris—must contain at least 90% of the grape variety named on the label, compared to the U.S. legal minimum of 75%.\n   - Exceptions to this rule include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, and several others, which need only 75% of the stated grape variety, allowing greater flexibility for blending.\n\nThe document emphasizes the adaptation and resilience of the Oregon wine industry, which has found its niche by leveraging its unique climate rather than relying on the wine production models of other regions."

    "contenu": "# THE D’OR IN CÔTE D’OR\n\n**The name Côte d’Or** is often translated as “golden slope,” perhaps because the wines from here cost a ransom, or perhaps because the vineyards turn golden in autumn. However, the term is actually a contraction of Côte d’Orient, “eastern-facing slope”—a reference to the fact that the vineyards face east to catch each day’s morning sun.\n\n## 7 In Terms of Sensory Characteristics\nBurgundies don’t lend themselves to quick evaluation. The wines are extremely elegant, highly nuanced, and often rather ethereal. They require a lot of concentration on the part of the taster. It’s not uncommon (even for professional tasters) to have to delve deep into their sensory aptitude in order to grasp each wine.\n\n## 8 Until the 1980s\nMost of the commerce in Burgundian wine was controlled by powerful brokers known as négociants. The négociants rose to power after the French Revolution, when fragmented ownership of small parcels of land in Burgundy made it economically and physically difficult for small growers to bottle, market, and sell their own wine.\n\nTraditionally, négociants bought (negotiated for) dozens if not hundreds of small lots of wine from numerous growers, then blended these lots into several wines, bottled them, and sold them under their own labels. A négociant house, such as Louis Jadot, would buy many tiny lots of Gevrey-Chambertin to bottle a Louis Jadot Gevrey-Chambertin, and many lots of Pommard to bottle a Louis Jadot Pommard. The négociant would, of course, also buy many lots of a Premier Cru vineyard. For example, Louis Jadot might buy several lots of the Premier Cru vineyard Les Amoureuses (the name means “the women in love”) and make a Louis Jadot Chambolle-Musigny “Les Amoureuses.” Generally speaking, the négociants of the past owned few—if any—vineyards themselves."

    "contenu": "Here's the structured content from the document titled \"WINE TASTING\":\n\n---\n\n### PERCEIVED DRYNESS OR SWEETNESS DOES NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH MEASUREMENTS OF SUGAR CONTENT.\n- **Explanation**: Wines cannot solely rely on sugar content labels to indicate style due to variations in how sugars and other components like alcohol influence perceived sweetness. Factors such as elevated acidity and carbonation can reduce sweetness perception, while elevated alcohol can enhance it. For instance, \"brut\" Champagne may taste dry despite having up to 15 grams of sugar per liter because other factors like less residual sugar in some wines can make them taste sweeter than they actually are.\n\n### SINCE THE DEGREE OF SWEETNESS IS CONTROLLED BY THE WINEMAKER, ANY GRAPE CAN BE MADE INTO EITHER A SWEET OR A DRY STYLE.\n- **Explanation**: The ability to control wine style through winemaking allows for diverse outputs from dry to sweet regardless of the grape type or origin. While certain wine regions and grape types have traditional associations with sweetness or dryness, these are based on tradition rather than inherent qualities of the grapes. For example, while Riesling from Germany and the U.S. might retain sweetness, those from Alsace and Australia are typically dry. Winemakers have the choice to either follow these traditional styles or deviate from them.\n\n### PERCEIVED SWEETNESS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME; AS WINES AGE, THEY WILL ALWAYS TASTE DRIER, NEVER SWEETER.\n- **Explanation**: As wines age, they naturally taste dryer even though the sugar content remains technically unchanged. Young wines usually exhibit more sweetness, which diminishes as the wine matures. This trend is emphasized in dessert wines, which, despite their high sugar content, will seem dryer over decades. Properly made dry wines also age well, showing improved characteristics over time.\n\n---\n\nThis document reflects different aspects of how sweetness in wine is perceived rather than being directly correlated to the measurable sugar content, emphasizing the influences of winemaking practices and aging processes."

    "contenu": "## EATING SAUTERNES\n\nSauternes is one of the most magical things you can drink—and (as it turns out) eat. Now, you may have yet to come across dark chocolate–covered, Sauternes-soaked raisins, and indeed there are only a scant few places (both in Paris) where you can get these little rubbins of hedonism. But get them you must. They will look innocent enough. But the minute you take a tiny bite and the mind-blowing flavor of Sauternes seeps into the luscious dark chocolate, well, this is when (as with everyone else who experiences them) your eyes will go wide and you momentarily won't know what to do with yourself. I have been told that Parisians think it's quite romantic to spend rainy mornings in bed, eating dark chocolate–covered Sauternes raisins with a loved one. You will have to test this for yourself.\n\nOnly a few confiserie (candy shops) in France sell chocolate-covered Sauternes, requiring that you keep a close lookout for the delicious nuggets when you are in that country. For decades, the best of these (and a temple of gastronomy for anyone with a sweet tooth) was L'Etoile d'Or, in Paris's 9th Arrondissement. (Alas, the historic shop closed in 2014 after a fire.) Today, luckily, a French shop called Oulala (sweet.oulala@gmail.com), sells them by mail order. Oulala indeed.\n\n### Wine Characteristics\n\nThese are not feeble wines. The sensory impact of a wine with 14 percent alcohol and 10 to 15 percent residual sugar is formidable. Plus, another factor comes into play: the botrytis itself. When the grapes being pressed have been perfectly infected, the mold, as well as the alcohol, can help kill the yeasts. As a result, the fermenting must may reach only 13 percent alcohol before the mold and alcohol working in tandem destroy the yeasts and cause fermentation to stop. At 13 percent alcohol, a sweet wine tastes more refined, elegant, and in balance than it does at a higher level of alcohol. Thus, with Sauternes and Barsac the finesse and complexity of the wines is directly related to how thoroughly and uniformly the botrytis takes hold in the vineyard.\n\n#### The Taste of Botrytis\n\nCan you taste botrytis in the wine? An experienced taster can. The mold is not washed off or in any other way removed from the grapes and bunches, and it does contribute to the flavor. That flavor, however, is not like something that was left too long in the back of the refrigerator. Botrytis adds an extra dimension, sometimes described as being faintly like sweet corn or mushrooms, to the overall complexity of the wines."

It combines juniper-forward gin and hoppy beer, specifically using beer as a spicy and aromatic modifier rather than overwhelming the base spirit. The recipe also highlights the use of pineapple juice in a way that focuses on the tropical richness rather than creating a tiki-style drink. Thomas Waugh's approach blends these ingredients uniquely, complemented by a bit of citrus and additional flavor from Velvet Falernum.\n\nHere's the recipe structured in Markdown format:\n\n### Strange Brew\n_By Thomas Waugh_\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 ounces Tanqueray No. Ten Gin\n- 3/4 ounce Velvet Falernum\n- 1 ounce Pineapple Juice\n- 1/2 ounce Lemon Juice\n- Green Flash IPA Beer\n\n**Garnish:**\n- 1 Mint Sprig\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Short shake all the ingredients (except the IPA) with 3 ice cubes.\n2. Strain into a pilsner glass filled with crushed ice.\n3. Top with IPA.\n4. Garnish with the mint sprig.\n5.

The number one choice among these ingredients turned out to be salt, underscoring its value as the most crucial taste enhancer for making savory foods appealing. It also notes that sweetness plays a similar role in desserts.\n\n### Sourness\nSourness is presented as second only to salt in savory foods and sugar in sweet foods regarding its importance as a flavor enhancer. The text explains how sour elements like lemon juice or vinegar can add sparkle and brightness to dishes. The balance of acidity with other tastes is vital for the overall success of a dish."

    "contenu": "### A CHEF'S NOTE\n\nI first saw *The Sound of Music* in Singapore. I was eight years old. My parents took my two brothers and me to the cinema off Orchard Road. I loved the film. It was my first look at Switzerland, my father's native land, a place I had never seen. It was so far off and exotic. We left the theater and walked through a street market. My mom, a brunette Irishwoman with a passion for decorating, painting, and interesting food, stopped at a market stall and got us pork from a Chinese vendor. It was pressed so thin you could almost see through it. It was barbecued with fragrant spices. I remember biting into it and tasting sweetness and the aroma of ground spices (although I couldn't identify the ingredients at the time). Something happened inside me. I loved the taste of that simple pork in the same way that I loved the songs that I had just heard Julie Andrews and her movie family sing for us. To me, that taste was music.\n\nI was beginning to learn the language of taste. My next strong food memory is about a year later. An Indian man, next to my father's silver-plating shop, made chapati—a kind of thin bread. He used his own mix of spices every day as he worked over his little outdoor stove. The way he handled and flipped and pressed the dough reminded me of a circus juggler. To me, the technique and the taste were inseparable.\n\nOften in those years my brothers and I would join my dad for an afternoon's fishing. Sometimes we would even catch fish! Grass carp, and little fish whose names we never knew, but which we would bring home and give to our gardener, who would grill them up with yet another mix of freshly ground ingredients from the spice stalls. By the time I was ten years old, my brothers and I knew and loved the spices and tastes of Asia. Then came a big change for our family as we pulled up stakes and moved across the globe to Switzerland. I felt cold air for the first time. I saw snow for the first time. It looked impossible and magical and wonderful.\n\nThey say that people learn languages most easily when they're young. With that move to Switzerland I began as a young boy to learn whole new languages of taste. Where many Europeans go to the East to discover new and exotic flavors, I found the flavors of Bern, my Swiss canton, as exotic as *The Tales of the Arabian Nights*. The cheeses with their aroma and textures captivated me."

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Introduction**: It notes that in Piedmont, Barbera can be initially accompanied by courses such as antipasti, pasta, etc., before switching to other wine styles like Barolo or Barbaresco. The frizzante styles, while hard to find, are mentioned as good companions to rich food.\n\n2. **Comparison with Sangiovese**: Barbera is characterized as an essential wine for pairing with \"red\" sauces, due to its high acidity, which is essential when pairing with tomato-based sauces. The bright fruit taste of Barbera enhances the flavors of dishes, adding a \"pop.\"\n\n3. **Food Pairing Options**:\n   - It can pair well with dishes from veal chops to grilled halibut, and from simple roast lamb to mixed antipasti.\n   - Especially noted are its pairings with grilled portobello mushrooms, char siu (roast pork), tandoori chicken, or Vietnamese shaking beef.\n   - Suggested as an option with pizza, emphasizing that few wines are better partnered with pizza or even burritos.\n\n4. **Unique Affinity with Mushrooms**: The wine is said to have a special affinity with mushrooms from Piedmont's truffles. The document suggests sautéing them and serving them over pasta, steak, or on toasted slices of bread like crostini.\n\n5. **Seasoning**: When paired with more traditional or earthy wines, it's suggested to add a bit of garlic or herbs to bond the flavors together.\n\n6. **Wine Characteristics**:\n   - Modern-style bottlings can be quite oaky, which should be a consideration when pairing with food.\n   - If the wine is smoky and sweet, it works well with mesquite or other charcoal-grilled foods. \n   - Barbera can vary in its finish based on the characteristics derived from oak aging.\n\n7. **Pairing Pointers Summary**:\n   - **Comfort Foods**: Barbera pairs well with burgers, pizzas, meat loaves, and burritos.\n   - **Charcuterie**: It matches well with northern Italian staples like salami, soppressata, mortadella, bologna, prosciutto, and lardo, and complements French pâté and terrines.\n   - **Mushrooms**: Suggested with a range from morels to portobellos, and can be tossed with veal chops, burgers, and in risotto.\n   - **Fish**: The wine’s high acid, low tannins, and balanced flavors make it suitable for grilled tuna, swordfish, and potentially even shark. Adds that adding a tomato vinaigrette or basic puttanesca enhances the pairing.\n\nThe document overall affirms the versatility of Barbera wine in enhancing the flavors of a wide variety of dishes, highlighting its adaptability across different cuisines and preparations."

Casts an aura over the entirety of elements from vine to climate to earth, defining the inherent characteristics that come through in the wine.\n  \n- **THIN**: Describes a wine as lacking body, low in alcohol, and lacking fruit flavors, possibly due to grapes produced at a very high yield. Tastes watery.\n\n- **TOASTING**: Charring inside a new barrel to open flame. This process caramelizes the staves of the wood, giving the barrels treated this way their own unique vanilla, toasty character.\n\n- **TOPPING UP**: Adding more wine to a barrel or container to replace any wine lost through evaporation, preventing oxidation. This term is also used in more general circumstances to denote adding wine to a glass in which there's only a sip or two left.\n\n- **TRANSFER PROCESS**: A less expensive way to make sparkling wine than the traditional méthode champenoise (see the French Glossary). Involves secondary fermentation in individual bottles like in Champagne, but then involves riddling and disgorging in large tanks under pressure.\n\n- **TRUNK**: The vine’s permanent vertical stem, which grows out of the ground.\n\n- **TYPICITY**: The quality of a wine having the characteristic attributes typical of its region and grape variety. This is subjective but required by law for appellation status.\n\n- **ULLAGE**: The space that develops near the neck and shoulder inside a wine bottle or container due to leakage or evaporation. Wine with significant ullage will often be oxidized and depreciated in value.\n\n- **UNFILTERED**: Describes a wine that has not gone through filtration to clarify and remove yeast and other unwanted elements. Unfiltered wines might undergo fining to remove larger particles, and they can still be less than brilliantly clear.\n\n- **UNFINED**: Wine that has not undergone fining to remove large particulate matter or some tannins. Such wines emphasize the natural flavor and texture of the wine.\n\n- **UNOAKED**: Wine that has been fermented and aged in stainless steel or concrete instead of oak barrels, offering a more direct expression of the fruit's characteristics.\n\n- **VANILLIN**: A compound in oak barrels that imparts a flavor and smell reminiscent of vanilla to the wine. Newer barrels generally contain more vanillin compared to older ones."

    "contenu": "## The Keys to Understanding Food\n\nWhich comes first, the food or the wine? This question, like the chicken-and-egg dilemma, can lead people in circles, because the synergy between food and wine makes it impossible to make decisions about either one in isolation. But to know how a food might affect the way we perceive a good wine, we need to understand how various flavors and preparation techniques contribute to the taste of a finished dish. Now that we know how to define a wine’s ability to go with food, we need to get a handle on how to understand a dish.\n\nRecipes are as different as snowflakes; it’s impossible to pair up every recipe with a single perfect wine. As with wines, in thinking about any recipe the rationale remains the same: identify certain basic characteristics. Rather than get caught up in thinking about a dish in all its complexity, it’s far easier to look at the three food keys and then determine how to proceed.\n\n### Key 1. Ingredients\nWe have been “trained” to think about a dish primarily in terms of its ingredients. From a wine and food perspective, this approach allows you to think about pairings in a formulaic way: if you know the ingredients, you know the correct wine selection, right? Red meat with red wine, and white meat and fish with white wine. Well, sort of.\n\nCertainly, when you’re pairing wine and food, what’s cooking is important, and it’s often the main consideration. Of course, the wine you choose to accompany rock cod will be the polar opposite of what you’d choose to go with leg of lamb. However, within the broad “red” and “white” categories of meat, fish, and poultry, there are many shades of pink. For example, some fish are strongly fishy (sturgeon, mackerel, anchovies, and bluefish), while others are mild (rock cod, halibut, sole, and trout).\n\nRed meat can be strong, like lamb, or mild, like a filet of beef. White meat (pork and veal) is very different from red meat in personality, often acting more like chicken, semineutral in character and much influenced by the supporting cast of ingredients. Poultry also may vary from mild (chicken) to pungent (squab). Then there are other categories, such as offal (sweetbreads, liver, and so on), vegetables, grains, and legumes. So it really is more complicated than choosing a red wine for dinner because you’re having meat.\n\nA handful of very useful ingredients can inform—and hedge—your wine and food pairings. Often referred to as “bridge ingredients” or “wine links,” these allow you to play Merlin in the kitchen. See the table on page 22 for a list of “magic” ingredients and their effects.\n\n### Key 2. Cooking Methods\nAlthough the selection of ingredients is important, it’s only one element of the overall plan. And while it’s true that the primary ingredient in the food may determine the wine selection, just as often it is the cooking method that will be the critical factor."

The content can be divided into two primary sections:\n\n### Personal Experience with Apples\n- The author recounts how sampling different apples from a greenmarket and various growers in the United States and England has broadened their understanding and appreciation of apple varieties.\n- The experience underscores that apples' qualities vary significantly based on their origin, growing conditions, and type. This variation influences their suitability for fresh eating or juice production.\n\n### Evaluating Apple Juice as a Commodity\n- Apple juice is critiqued for its commoditized nature, as a product that is primarily made from apples not deemed suitable for fresh consumption.\n- The production process typically involves clarification, pasteurization, concentration, reconstitution, and blending, which can dilute the unique characteristics of the original apple variety.\n- The author advises against using commercial apple juice in cocktails, contrasting it unfavorably with artisanal or single-variety juices and ciders, which often retain more of the apple's original flavor profile. These preferred types are usually available at specialty stores and farmers' markets, but they are almost always unpasteurized, which affects their shelf-life and availability.\n- Pasteurization is critiqued for damaging the subtle flavors of apple juice, with most commercial juices being also faulted for their unnatural colors due to being overheated, which leads to oxidation that significantly alters taste.\n\nThis informative document highlights the complexities of apple juice production and its impacts on quality, especially relevant for enthusiasts interested in culinary applications, such as cocktail making."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"THE SOUND OF TASTE\" explores the significant, yet often underappreciated, impacts of sound on our perception of taste. Here are the key points presented in the document:\n\n1. **Psychological Influence of Sound on Flavor**: The document discusses findings by Oxford University professor Charles Spence, who conducted research showing that sounds can alter how food tastes. For instance, a potato chip tastes different when it sounds noisier during consumption; similarly, the sound of a Champagne bottle being opened (the pop) or its fizz enhances the drinking experience.\n\n2. **Influence of Background Noise**: Beyond the direct sounds associated with the food or drink itself, ambient sounds also have an impact; for example, bacon may taste more bacony if the sound of it sizzling is heard, and eggs taste more egg-like when the sound of chickens is nearby.\n\n3. **Champagne Production**: The document transitions from the sensory experiences elicited by sounds to how these experiences play into the complexities of Champagne production. It describes how producers maintain a stock of reserve wines from previous years, blending them with current production to ensure flavor consistency over the years and improve the wine's depth and complexity.\n\n4. **The Art of Blending**: The art of blending Champagne is emphasized. After harvest, wine-makers blend dozens of base wines (from different vintages) to create a house's nonvintage Champagne, referred to as the \"assemblage.\" This blending is cited as a high form of skill and art within the region.\n\n5. **Special Lots for Exceptional Vintages**: During particularly good years, certain lots of wine are earmarked for making a house's vintage Champagne or for creating a prestige cuvée — the most expensive and often top-tier offering of a house, illustrating the nuanced selections and strategies involved in Champagne production.\n\nOverall, the document connects the sensory perception of taste influenced by sound to the sophisticated and strategic production of Champagne, highlighting nuances in both sensory and production processes that contribute to the beverage's final quality."

Yet microscopic molds are inevitably present on much of our food, and certain molds have long traditions of use by people who grow them on foods as a means of processing. In the West, the most familiar mold ferments are cheeses, though molded cheeses do not seem to hold universal appeal. \"Most Westerners still have a deep-seated prejudice against moldy products, and they generally associate the word 'mold' with food spoilage, as in 'moldy bread,'\" observe William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi.^1\n\nIn Asia, molds are used much more widely and have greater acceptance. \"The word 'mold' there has a rather positive connotation, something like 'yeast' in the West,\" write Shurtleff and Aoyagi. Mixed cultures including yeasts and bacteria but typically dominated by molds, grown on grains—transliterated from Chinese [麴] as chhü (or qu or jiuqu or da qu)—have been used in Asia for thousands of years. \"There is no exact English equivalent for qu,\" writes H. T. Huang.\n\nIt has been translated variously as barm, leaven, yeast, and starter. None is entirely satisfactory but ferment is probably the best we can do since chhü contains both enzymes and live organisms. During incubation the enzymes hydrolyse the starch from the grain, the spores germinate, and the myceliae proliferate to produce more amylases. The yeasts grow in number and ferment the sugars generated in situ [in place] to alcohol. The procedure has been called Amylomyces, or simply Amylo."

The cups are more portable and less fragile than glass would be. More importantly, they have circular indentations in their sides that reflect candlelight across the metal base of the cup and make it possible to determine, in a dark cellar, the clarity of a wine just drawn from the barrel."

Looking at the data by gender, interestingly, 35 percent of women are supertasters while just 10 percent of men are. Supertaster abilities are also more common in Asians and in African Americans than in Caucasians. To determine if a person is a nontaster, taster, or supertaster, researchers give the subject a small taste of the nontoxic compounds 6-n-propylthiouracil (known as PROP) or phenyl thiocarbamate (known as PTC).\n\n**Supertasters experience this compound as so bitter they want to gag,** while tasters detect a faint whisper of bitterness and nontasters experience no taste sensation at all. Finally, but importantly, the term supertaster sounds thoroughly desirable (who doesn't want to be super at most things?)—but it is not. Supertasters live in a neon taste world where many flavor impressions are just too intense to enjoy. According to Dr. Hildegard Heymann, professor and enologist in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, supertasters usually dislike the taste of broccoli, spinach, cabbage, and sprouts; hot curry and chili; grapefruit and lemon; cigarettes; coffee; and (oh no) alcohol.

    "contenu": "# Cork: A Future or Farewell?\n\nIn a technologically advanced civilization, sealing wine with a hunk of bark may seem hopelessly archaic. Indeed, cork has a growing number of critics. Yet the promising thwock as a cork leaves a bottle, a familiar sound for centuries, may continue to be heard for decades to come—at least with some expensive wines.\n\nCork, the bark of the cork oak tree (*Quercus suber*), is native to the poor, rocky soil of southern Portugal and Spain, as well as Sardinia, Algeria, Tunisia, Italy, and Morocco. Most top-quality corks used today come from Portuguese trees.\n\nCork's structural composition is remarkable. A cubic centimeter of cork contains roughly 40 million fourteen-sided cells arranged in rows and filled with a mixture of gases similar to oxygen. With a specific gravity of 0.25, it is four times lighter than water, yet highly elastic, capable of snapping back to its original shape after withstanding 14,000 pounds of pressure per cubic inch. Cork is impervious to air, almost impermeable by water, difficult to burn, resistant to temperature changes and vibrations, does not rot, and has the ability to mold itself to the contour of the container it is put into (such as the neck of a wine bottle).\n\nA cork tree is harvested, or stripped, for the first time when it is twenty-five years old, and thereafter once every nine years. Although stripping does no permanent damage, the tree will need two years or more to recover its vitality. A cork tree will be stripped, on average, sixteen times in its 150 to 200 years of life.\n\nThe stripping itself is grueling work. Using special wedge-shaped axes, workers peel four-foot planks from the bark during the intense summer heat when the tree's sap is circulating, making it possible to pry the bark off. Once the bark is stripped off, it is stored in rooms with concrete floors (not on the ground, where it could be contaminated by soil) and left to season and dry for several months. The bark is then boiled or steamed to improve its elasticity and flatten it, and then dried again and left in a dark cellar to dry out for three to four weeks. Finally, the bark is trimmed into rectangular planks and separated according to quality and thickness. Wine corks are shaped from the planks, graded, and washed in a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to remove dust, sanitize them, and lighten their color.\n\nBefore the mid-1990s, most corks were washed in a chlorine solution. Chlorine, alas, can react with moisture and fungi inside the cork to facilitate the growth of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) and related compounds, chemicals responsible for the “wet dog sitting on damp newspapers in a dank cellar” aroma wine can pick up from corks. A wine tainted with TCA is said to be “corked” (see page 113). Although chlorine is no longer used in cleaning corks, the problem of corked wines has not gone away, in part because wineries use water to clean barrels and equipment, and municipal water contains chlorine. Indeed, the average incidence of corked wine is now estimated at 2.5 percent. TCA can also be generated by other means. Sometimes the compound exists naturally in raw cork bark. But it has also been found in soil, inside barrels, on cardboard boxes, on wooden pallets, even just in the air—and from there, it can contaminate corks, which in turn taint the wine.\n\nToday, cork’s future is anything but clear. While the Portuguese government has taken measures to encourage improvements in cork manufacture and cork oak tree reforestation, wine producers around the world appear to be increasingly fed up with the cost and loss of reputation associated with tainted bottles. In response to the problem, a modern screw-cap initiative began in the Clare Valley of Australia as far back as 2000, with New Zealand soon following. (Wines with screw caps do not get tainted by TCA.) Today, about 45 percent of all Australian wine is stoppered by screw cap, as is 85 percent of all New Zealand wine. Worldwide, the number of wine bottles with screw caps continues to grow."

It is simmered with 100ml water broth, salt, tablespoon of sugar and finished with 450g of fresh peas. It's cooked for about 10 minutes and seasoned before serving with fresh butter.\n\n- **Pois & Panais**: Peas with parsnips.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson blanc**: A dish called surf 'n’ turf combining seafood and white meat with peas being a core ingredient. It's popular in British pubs and American grills, with an emphasis on the fresh, garden-picked quality of peas. The dish typically accompanies fish such as turbot, and meats like pork belly, often served with ingredients like aioli or parsley, aiming to enhance the salty flavor of the fish with sweetness from the peas.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson fumé**: Smoked fish with peas.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson gras**: a traditional dish from New England featuring heavily in the celebrations like Patriot's Day and Independence Day; made with fattier fish varieties and served with new potatoes. This dish is generally served as part of a strawberry shortcake which resembles the look of a French Fraisier cake.\n\n- **Pois & Pomme de terre**: Peas with potatoes.\n\n- **Pois & Porc**: Peas with pork, described as harmoniously paired like a well-matched outfit, citing a famous example from the 1850 Oxford English Dictionary. The dish uses heritage breeds of pork and peas and highlights traditional English cooking styles with additional ingredients like sage, thyme, or parsley and sometimes chestnuts or truffle in contemporary presentations.\n\n- **Pois & Poulet**: Chicken with peas. The dish emphasizes a simple pairing which, when executed well, like mixing roast chicken with a clamart (peas cooked with seasoned stock), offers a palatable and unpretentious food experience.\n\nThe document describes traditional combinations, cooking methods, and cultural significance of dishes that combine peas with various other food items, highlighting both traditional British and American culinary practices."

A milky appearance suggests degradation.\n- **Eyes**: Should be bright, black, and convex. Dull and gray appearance indicates age.\n- **Belly**: Intact without swelling or broken skin. Swelling suggests internal degradation.\n- **Cut Fish**: Fillets should be glossy, without surface drying.\n\n### Storing Fresh Fish and Shellfish: Refrigeration and Freezing\n- **Initial Care**: Good condition is crucial until consumption, focusing on averting spoilage caused by enzymes and bacteria that dull colors, flatten flavor, and soften textures.\n- **Microbial Influence**: Spoilage is mainly due to microbes like **Pseudomonas**. They speed decay similar to their effect on beef or pork.\n- **Chemical Byproducts**: Spoilage leads to the formation of ammonia, dimethylamine, indole, skatole, putrescine, cadaverine, and other compounds.\n- **Preventative Measures**: Initial cleaning and rinsing are critical to ward off bacteria.\n\n### Shellfish That Glow in the Dark\n- **Bioluminescence**: Certain shellfish can glow due to bacteria like **Photobacterium** and **Vibrio**, which are usually harmless to humans but indicate the presence of bacteria in the seafood."

    "contenu": "### DESSERT WINES\n\nFor years I've noted sadly that, with a few exceptions (mostly avid sommelier types and pastry chefs), people don’t give dessert wines much thought. It’s their loss. Admittedly, many diners are sated by the time they reach the end of the meal, but those who always pass on dessert wines are missing out on many of the wine world’s greatest and most delectable offerings.\n\n#### STYLES OF WINE AND WINE-GROWING AREAS\n\nWhile styles of dessert wines differ by grape, from country to country, and regionally, virtually all wine-growing areas make and adore their sticky wines! Style makes for an easier breakdown than geography or varietal, so in this last wine journey I cut loose from the template.\n\nAlmost all the great dessert wines are products of accident. Nobody, at the time most of these wines were born, made a conscious effort to define or produce distinguished sweet wines. They just happened.\n\n#### LATE-HARVEST WINES\n\nThe best-known category of stickies is late-harvest wines. As the descriptor implies, the grapes are picked late in the season. Wine producers of the past, farmers who simply grew grapes and made their own wine, did not have access to all the equipment, charts, and tools we utilize today to judge when to pick the grapes. As a result, some grapes were picked later than intended, and they were made into wines mostly so as not to waste the fruit. Late-harvested grapes—some of them left so long that they have begun to shrivel and turn to raisins on the vine—have higher levels of sugar. During fermentation, the yeast dies when the alcohol level in the wine reaches 18 to 19 percent. Simply stated, then, with very sweet grapes, fermentation stops before all the sugar has been consumed, and the residual sugar results in a sweet wine.\n\nIn the past, though initially delicious, many of these sweet wines would spoil rapidly or even re-ferment. Today, once a dessert wine is made, it is stabilized to enhance its keeping qualities."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Transformation of Atole:**\n   - **Background**: Historically, the Aztecs allowed atole, a traditional drink made from maize, to sour over several days until it developed an agreeable sourness, transforming into xococatolli.\n   - **Methods**: \n     - Soaking hard, ripe maize without lime and allowing it to dissolve, followed by souring before boiling.\n     - A second method involves soaking, grinding, and then souring the maize before boiling. A recipe is mentioned where maize dough is divided, partially boiled, left to stand overnight, and boiled again the next day.\n\n2. **Xococatolli:**\n   - In Spanish, xococatolli is referred to as atole agrio (sour atole).\n\n3. **Huitlacoche:**\n   - Described as a microbial transformation of corn, huitlacoche (Ustilago maydis) is a fungus growing on corn, also known in English as corn smut.\n   - **Cultural Significance**: Esteemed for its unique flavor, it is so appreciated in Aztec and later Mexican cuisine that it is sometimes deliberately introduced into crops.\n\n4. **Corn-based Fermented Beverages:**\n   - **Tesguiño:**\n     - Popular among the Huichol and Tarahumar peoples of Mexico.\n     - Made by malting corn, grinding it to a paste, simmering with water, and adding botanical catalysts for fermenting into a type of beer.\n     - Further exploration on Tesguiño in chapter 9 is suggested.\n   - **Sendecho:**\n     - Also made from malted corn fermented with hot chili peppers, known among the Mazahua people of central Mexico.\n\nEach point relates to different aspects of traditional maize cultivation and culinary practices in Mexico, reflecting both historical contexts and modern appreciation of these methods and flavors."

Concentrate your visits day by day in a given area (today Pomerol, tomorrow Graves, and so on).\n\n- **Accommodation and Dining:**\n  - **STAYING IN BORDEAUX CITY?** Check out the charming Le Boutique Hotel Bordeaux. Housed in an eighteenth-century UNESCO World Heritage building, this gem boasts everything luxe right down to the Hermès bath amenities. Out in the country, one of the most impressive hotels is Cordellian-Bages (cordellianbages.com) which is housed in a seventeenth-century mansion. The hotel's wines are made at Château Lynch-Bages.\n\n- **Wellness and Leisure:**\n  - **FOR A BREAK FROM WINE TASTING**, the spa at Château Smith Haut Lafitte is famous for its relaxing treatments, including spa products made with extracts from local grapes.\n\n- **Cultural Guidelines:**\n  - **BORDEAUX TENDS TO BE** a somewhat formal region. Leave the shorts and flip-flops at home.\n\n- **Visitor Etiquette:**\n  - **AN ADVANCE APPOINTMENT** (not to mention your best manners) are essential.\n\n- **Culinary Experience:**\n  - **FINALLY, don't miss a meal at La Tupina**, the legendary restaurant in Bordeaux's old quarter.

Chewing a mint leaf after pressing it against the mouth's roof demonstrates the low effort required for flavor extraction.\n- **Gentle Technique**: The process involves gently pressing and twisting the muddler in the shaker to avoid releasing bitter flavors.\n- **Additives**: Sweeteners are often added first to the shaker before the herbs to aid in the muddling process.\n- **Citrus and Fruit Muddling**: When muddling involves citrus or fruit, the pressure is slightly increased to help release oils or juices effectively. It's beneficial to visually inspect inside the shaker during muddling.\n- **Combination Muddling**: For cocktails requiring both fruit and herbs, the sweetener and herb go into the shaker first, followed by the fruit. This prevents the herbs from tearing.\n\n---\n\n### Rimming\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Preparation**: Before straining the cocktail into the serving glass, the rim of the glass is moistened, usually with water or a citrus fruit matching the drink’s flavor.\n- **Application**: Once moist, the rim is dipped into a chosen rimming mixture (like salt or sugar).\n- **Technique**: The glass should be rolled from the outside to keep the drink free of any particles from the rimming mixture.\n\n---\n\nThis specific document includes detailed instructions for two essential cocktail preparation techniques aimed at enhancing the flavor and presentation of cocktails."

Bottles and corks remained unchanged for decades while other types of products changed containers because, until recently, they still worked better than anything else. However, neither the bottle nor the wooden cork is problem-free, and today alternatives for both are showing up on store shelves. Glass and natural cork will certainly remain the industry standard for years to come, but after long resistance to innovation, new technology is finally shaking up the wine world, ushering in an era of modern wine packaging.\"\n\n**Additional Information about Melissa Monosoff**:\n- She is one of the top wine professionals in the Philadelphia area.\n- Monosoff is the sommelier at the award-winning Savona restaurant in Gulph Mills, Pennsylvania.\n- She serves as a consulting sommelier for the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, one of the world's largest purchasers of wine and spirits.\n- Monosoff is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America.\n- Her hospitality career began as a chef before she pursued a career in wine.\n- She has managed the beverage programs at top local restaurants including Maia, Striped Bass, and The Fountain at the Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia.\n\n**Main Text**:\n\"In addition to the traditional bottle, wine now comes in boxes and cans; cork stoppers may be replaced with synthetic plugs or screw tops. These alternatives address environmental concerns and quality-control issues and are designed for efficiency and practicality.

Here is a structured content summary of the document:\n\n1. **Origin and Definition of Culture**:\n   - The term \"culture\" originates from the Latin word \"cultura,\" derived from \"colere,\" meaning to cultivate or till.\n   - The earliest definition cited is from the Oxford English Dictionary: \"The cultivation of land, and derived senses.\"\n\n2. **Cultivation and Derivations**:\n   - Cultivation has broadened from agriculture to include various forms of nurturing or fostering growth; for instance, culturing cells or cultivating pearls.\n   - Practices such as aquaculture, viticulture, and horticulture embody extensions of the concept of culture. \n   - The document suggests that culture involves imbuing children with a collection of knowledge and practices.\n\n3. **Cultural Expansion and Appropriation**:\n   - The text touches on issues like cultural appropriation and the defense of cultural purity.\n   - Culture ties back to inherent actions of cultivating land and planting seeds, showing the deep roots and ancient practices underpinning various cultural phenomena.\n   - It links back to the Indo-European root *kwel*, related to words such as cycle, circle, and chakra, indicating the cyclical nature of cultural processes.\n\n4. **Culture and Fermentation**:\n   - The author connects the traditional use of the word culture with the biological process of fermentation, such as turning milk into yogurt.\n   - Fermentation is framed as both a cultural and biological process integral to human existence and coexistence with microbes.\n\n5. **Perpetuation and Preservation**:\n   - Culture, as a term, encompasses a wide range of human activities including the arts, spiritual practices, and scientific endeavors aimed at sustaining and advancing collective human life.\n   - A significant point made is the need for strategies to preserve surplus food through methods that respect and utilize microbial ecosystems.\n   - Fermented foods and beverages are highlighted as significant, not just as culinary elements, but as essential cultural practices.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes that culture is a dynamic, cyclical process influenced by historical practices and the natural world, encompassing both the growth of societies and the biological processes that support human life."

    "contenu": "**THE NORTH CENTRAL COAST:**  \n**SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS, MONTEREY, CHALONE, MOUNT HARLAN, CARMEL VALLEY, & SANTA LUCIA HIGHLANDS**\n\nMonterey County and those American Viticultural Areas north of it, up to San Francisco Bay, are often collectively referred to as the North Central Coast. The area includes the important wine regions of Santa Cruz Mountains, Chalone, Mount Harlan, Carmel Valley, Santa Lucia Highlands, and, of course, Monterey. These AVAs range in size from quite large (Monterey has about 40,000 acres/16,187 hectares of grapevines) to diminutive (Chalone has 300 acres/120 hectares of grapevines), and each has a distinct personality.\n\n**SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS**\n\nSouth of San Francisco, about an hour and a half’s drive along California’s iconic Highway 101, is the funky university town of Santa Cruz, a coastal haven for aging hippies and ardent surfers. Although it’s right next door to Silicon Valley, Santa Cruz is, experientially speaking, about as far away as you can get. Here, the mountain air has a thrillingly sharp, close-to-the-ocean freshness to it. Ancient redwood forests soar up into a cerulean sky. The mountains themselves have been torn and thrust into beautifully rugged formations by the perilous San Andreas Fault, which lies below them.\n\nThanks to the tangle of mountain crevices, canyons, hilltops, craggy slopes, knolls, and valleys, plus varying altitudes and orientations to the sun, the vineyards of the Santa Cruz Mountains can have widely different mesoclimates. In general, the higher vineyards (some are more than 2,000 feet/600 meters in elevation) and those facing the Pacific Ocean are considerably cooler than lower vineyards and those facing east, toward the warmer interior valleys.\n\nThe individuality of the vineyards explains why the region is known, seeming paradoxically, not only for cool-climate varieties like pinot noir and chardonnay but also for those that like more warmth, including zinfandel and cabernet sauvignon. What all vines here do share is the beneficial struggle of growing in the region’s thin, stony mountain soil."

Fuji, which can be seen from the vineyards of Yamanashi Prefecture.\n\n**Content:**\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, however, Japan had at least some success in developing sophisticated viticultural techniques that allowed for the production of Japanese-grown merlot, chardonnay, and other popular Vitis vinifera varieties, even in humid conditions and in areas without significant periods of sun. Among these techniques were planting vines like hedges on steep mountain terraces for maximum sun exposure and constructing high, elevated trellises or pergolas that kept the fruit as much as 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground for maximum air ventilation. Alas, for the most part, both techniques encouraged quantity over quality, and thus met with only partial success. As a result, in the last two decades, grape-growing for fine wine continues to shift beyond traditional areas and toward cool but sunnier and somewhat drier areas such as Nagano Prefecture and Yamagata Prefecture, as well as on the far northern island of Hokkaido."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"Fresh Ingredients for Muddling\" provides a guide on muddling fresh ingredients into a drink and lists various fruits, vegetables, and herbs commonly used for this purpose. Below is a structured content representation of the information in the document:\n\n---\n\n### Fresh Ingredients for Muddling\n\n**Introduction:**  \nWhen muddling fresh fruit, vegetables, or herbs into a drink, consider the ingredient being used before deciding how long and hard to muddle it. Herbs and delicate fruits (such as raspberries) only need brief, gentle muddling to release their oils and juices; sturdy fruit and vegetables (apples, pears, citrus, celery, etc.) will need more intense muddling to extract their flavors. Fruit and vegetables should be cut into pieces (1 inch or smaller) to make the muddle easier. Fruit doesn't need to be seeded before muddling, but care should be taken not to crush the seeds, as they can impart a bitter flavor.\n\n**Ingredients Commonly Muddled:**\n\n- Apples\n- Basil\n- Blackberries\n- Celery\n- Cherries\n- Cherry tomatoes\n- Cilantro\n- Citrus\n- Cucumbers\n- Grapes\n- Kaffir lime leaves\n- Mint\n- Nectarines\n- Peaches\n- Pears\n- Raspberries\n- Sage\n- Strawberries\n- Tangerines\n\n**Juice Information:**\n- **Orange Juice:** Fresh orange juice isn’t used in many cocktails, so it is prepared in smaller batches using oranges left over from garnish preparation. One medium orange yields 3 to 4 ounces of juice.\n- **Pineapple Juice:** Pineapples are skinned and passed through a juice extractor, then double strained to remove pulp. One pineapple yields roughly 16 ounces of juice.\n\n**Additional Fresh Juices Used in Lesser Quantities:**\n- Blood orange\n\n---"

    "contenu": "### Structured Content of the Document\n\n#### 1. Apple Selection for Cider and Cocktails\n- **Importance of Sugar-to-Acid Ratio:** In hard-cider production, it is common to quote apple varieties based on their sugar-to-acid ratio. This helps in determining the strength and flavor of the apple juice based on one numerical value.\n- **Measurement Instruments and Challenges:** Most people lack access to refractometers or pH meters properly calibrated for apple juice. Various benchmarks for apple varieties are available online.\n- **Guidelines for Specific Varieties:**\n  - **Ideal Sugar Level:** For cocktails, a preferred apple juice should have a sugar-to-acid ratio around 13 and 15; less than 11 Brix is not useful.\n  - **Examples:** Granny Smiths (more acidic), Gala apples (low acid and sweet, sugar level around 21 Brix).\n\n#### 2. Cocktail Experimentation\n- **High Sugar and Acid Apples:** Ashmead’s Kernel and the Wickson crabapple are noted for their high sugar and acid levels, suitable for innovative cocktail recipes.\n\n#### 3. Overripe and Over-the-Hill Apples\n- **Identifying Overripe Apples:** Overripe apples often feel greasy, may exhibit a distinct wax coating which softens as they ripen, and may feel softer than usual.\n- **Culinary Uses:** Mildly overripe apples can be used as a cooking ingredient while heavily overripe ones are avoided due to the development of volatile esters and solvents.\n- **Perfumy Aroma:** Overripe apples can develop enticing perfumy aromas, but these are ephemeral and need careful handling to capture in culinary preparations.\n\n#### 4. Specific Variety: Ashmead’s Kernel\n- **Description and Source:** Ashmead’s Kernel is a russeted, yellowish-skinned English apple dating back to the early eighteenth century, typically sourced from a grower in New Hampshire.\n- **Flavor Qualities:** Noted for its rich taste and excellent juicing properties.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis document provides insights into selecting and utilizing different apple varieties for beverages like cocktails and cider, and explains the considerations and potential uses for overripe apples in culinary contexts."

Fruit-driven New World styles are preferred.\n  - Cheeses, specifically hard cheeses like Parmesan, rich cheeses like triple-cream St. André, and salty cheeses such as Greek or Bulgarian feta.\n  - Dishes with crunchy textures like phyllo pastry and deep-fried foods (e.g., Southern fried chicken, tempura, Italian fritto misto).\n  - Dishes with inherent toasty character like the wine itself (toasted canapés or puff pastry dishes).\n  - Dishes that imply sweetness or have lightly sweet condiments or treatments.\n  - Foods difficult to match with other wines, such as egg dishes and soups.\n  - Rustic or coarsely textured foods: polenta, pesto, hummus, baba ghanoush.\n  - Middle Eastern foods generally pair well.\n\n- **Challenging Pairings (Not Good With):**\n  - Dishes that are too rich or flavorful that they squash the subtlety of the wine.\n  - Extremely spicy dishes that eviscerate the wine’s flavor.\n  - Dishes that are overly sweet unless paired with the sweeter styles of wine.\n  - Strong-tasting fish, strong flavors, and certain vegetables like broccoli, escarole, and radicchio which can make the wine taste metallic.\n  - Rich red meats, whereas many chefs prefer pairing rosé styles with these foods, but results may vary.\n\nThese insights emphasize the versatility of sparkling wines in pairing with a variety of global cuisines, while also noting specific combinations that might not work well, maintaining the wine's integrity and flavor profile."

The two largest cava producers, Freixenet and Codorníu, each produce far more sparkling wine by the Champagne method than any Champagne house makes.\n- **CONSEJO REGULADOR**: Local governing body that enforces wine policy for a given area, including the boundaries of the area, the grape varieties permitted, maximum YIELD, and so forth. Every Spanish wine region with a DENOMINACIÓN DE ORIGEN has a Consejo Regulador.\n- **COSECHA**: Year of harvest, or vintage.\n- **CRIADERA**: Literally, \"nursery.\" Criadera refers to a layer of Sherry casks, all of which contain wine of approximately the same age and blend.

En rama Sherries are extremely fresh and vivid and last mere months because they are so fragile.

    "contenu": "The document provides a comprehensive discussion of the Nebbiolo grape, known for its high tannin content and substantial structure, especially when young. Cultivated primarily in the Piedmont region in northwestern Italy, Nebbiolo is also grown successfully in the Guadalupe Valley of Mexico. This grape is notably challenging to cultivate and suffer from travel due to its delicate nature.\n\nHere are the main points covered:\n\n1. **Introduction to Nebbiolo**:\n   - Describes Nebbiolo as extremely tannic and robust.\n   - Mention of Nebbiolo's struggle with cultivation outside its native region, except in Mexico.\n\n2. **Cultural and Reputation Context**:\n   - Nebbiolo holds a regal status in Italy, compared with France's Cabernet Sauvignons.\n   - It is integral to producing high-end Piedmontese wines like Barolo and Barbaresco, which pair well with expensive white truffles.\n\n3. **Etymology of 'Nebbiolo'**:\n   - The grape's name comes from 'nebbia', meaning fog, which authentically describes the bloom of yeasts on the grape skins at ripeness.\n   - The name also refers to the fog-like conditions in the Piedmontese hills during late fall, essential for its cultivation.\n\n4. **Flavor Profile and Wine Description**:\n   - Nebbiolo wines possess flavors and aromas of tar, violets, and a pronounced, espresso-like bitterness due to the strong tannins.\n\n5. **Modern Winemaking and Its Impacts**:\n   - Previously, it was deemed necessary to age Nebbiolo wines for at least a decade.\n   - Modern techniques have reduced the aging period while retaining, if not enhancing, the delightful qualities of the wine when consumed young.\n\nThe text also includes a captioned image discussing the use of wildflowers in vineyards in Martinborough, New Zealand. These flowers help maintain moisture in the soil and prevent vines from getting \"wet feet\" (a detrimental condition caused by overly wet soil).\n\nFinally, the document is finished with a new section heading for \"Pinot Gris,\" suggesting a continuation into another topic about a different type of wine."

    "contenu": "The text primarily discusses \"poi,\" a traditional Hawaiian dish made from taro root. Key points from the document are outlined below:\n\n1. **Processing and Microbial Action:** Grinding the corms (the edible part of taro) immediately after heating helps break down bacterial clumps or colonies. This process not only increases the number of organisms but also improves their distribution within the poi, resulting in a more uniform fermentation.\n\n2. **Preference and Fermentation:** People's preference for poi varies from mild (one day old) to sour (several days old), influenced by fermentation time, which can range from one to several days depending on the local climate. Cooler temperatures can slow down the fermentation process. The color and texture of poi also change as fermentation progresses.\n\n3. **Consistency and Preparation:** The consistency of poi can vary from thin to very thick, often described by the number of fingers it takes to eat (e.g., two-finger poi is considered ideal). The thickness or runniness can be adjusted by adding water.\n\n4. **Nutritional and Medicinal Benefits:** Poi is noted for its healing properties and potential nutritional benefits, especially for infants who are intolerant to other foods like breast milk or soy formula. Research and anecdotal evidence suggest that poi could be beneficial for infants with allergies or failure-to-thrive issues, and it may also have anti-tumor and immune-stimulating effects.\n\nThis summary captures the key details outlined in the document regarding the culinary and health-related aspects of poi."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content from the provided document:\n\n---\n\n### Léon Beyer, Domaine Ostertag, and Zind Humbrecht.\n\n## PINOT BLANC\n\nJust like pinot gris, pinot blanc is, genetically speaking, a clone of pinot noir. Alsace's pinot blanc (also known as klevner) is easy to like, dependable, and safe. It’s never as thrilling as riesling, as dramatic as gewürztraminer, or as novel as pinot gris; nonetheless, the top Alsace pinot blancs are tasty wines with baked-apple flavors and a light texture. Unfortunately, there are also many bland versions.\n\nHistorically, some older pinot blanc vineyards also contained a small percentage of vines later identified as the Burgundian white grape Auxerrois. Thus, some Alsace pinot blancs may be, technically speaking, field blends. Top producers of pinot blanc include Domaine Albert Boxler, Josmeyer, and Domaine Weinbach.\n\n## PINOT NOIR\n\nThe only red wine made in Alsace is pinot noir. In the past, the quality was so variable that much of it ended up looking like rosé. Then, in the 1990s, a few of the top wineries began rethinking their approach, planting pinot noir in better sites, lowering the yields, using better equipment and aging the wine in new barrels. As expected, the wine got better. A lot better. In good vintages Marcel Deiss’s Bergheim Burlenberg pinot noir, Ostertag’s Fronholz pinot noir, and Hugel’s Jubilee pinot noir show earthy, complex, almost Burgundy-like flavors.\n\nLike all other Alsace wines, pinot noir must, by law, be bottled in tall, Germanic flute bottles. Because it's surprising, if not a little unnerving, to see red wine flow from what looks like a bottle of riesling, several producers are battling the bottle law, in hopes of having the rule changed.\n\n## VENDANGE TARDIVE AND SÉLECTION DE GRAINS NOBLES\n\nTwo sensational types of late-harvest wines, vendange tardive (VT) and sélection de grains nobles (SGN), can be made only in certain favorable years (sometimes only once or twice a decade) and even then they generally make up less than 1 percent of the region’s production.\n\nBut sensational isn't nearly adequate as an adjective. These wines can be astonishing in the depth and vividness of their flavors. By law, only the four grape varieties allowed for Grand Cru wines may be used: riesling, gewürztraminer, pinot gris, and muscat. By the time they are picked, the grapes for VT wines may be (but don’t have to be) infected with Botrytis cinerea, the noble rot responsible for Sauternes.\n\n---"

Here’s an outline of the structured content along with some highlighted points:\n\n1. **Character Traits of Wine and Food**: The text emphasizes that wine does not necessarily need to match the dish strictly by its origin or traditional pairings. For instance, an Argentinean Malbec does not exclusively pair with Argentinean dishes like \"asado.\"\n\n2. **Psychological Aspects of Wine and Food Pairing**: It highlights that people’s emotions and environments (friends, location, etc.) influence the rationale behind food pairings more than the inherent properties of the wine or food itself.\n\n3. **Concept of Flavors and Tastes**:\n   - **Flavors and Tastes**: Distinguishes between 'flavors,' which are subjective and 'tastes,' which are objective and quantifiable.\n   - **Primary Tastes**: Identifies the primary tastes as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami – a recently recognized taste associated with flavors of richness like those found in mushrooms, parmesan cheese, and soy sauce.\n\n4. **Impact of Taste on Pairings**:\n   - **Role of Primary Tastes**: Discusses how these fundamental tastes play a role in food and wine pairings, hinting at a blend of creating harmonious or contrasting pairings depending on the taste profiles involved.\n\n5. **Impact of Perception**:\n   - **Perception Changes**: Notes that the perception of wine changes when it is tasted alone versus with food, impacting how pairings are viewed and judged.\n\n6. **Influence of Literature on Wine Pairing**:\n   - Reference to the newsletter \"Wine and Food Companion\" penned by David Rosengarten and Joshua Wesson in the 1990s, and the book \"Red Wine with Fish,\" which are indicated as influential works in the field of wine and food pairing.\n\nThis document draws on the nuances of how food and wine pairing can transcend traditional boundaries, suggesting a more eclectic and subjective approach depending on individual preferences and situational contexts. It also emphasizes the importance of the psychological aspect and personal experience in creating satisfying pairings."

Oak can add desirable aromatic qualities, but as with all condiments, it should be used sparingly. Barrels also soften a wine, just as slow-cooking tenderizes a tough cut of meat. Oak treatment brings forward a wine’s development, making it easier and more pleasurable to drink when it is still relatively young. Oaked wines are neither superior nor inferior, however, for barrel treatment is more flattering to some wine styles than others.\n\nOther woods have been used for wine barrels, but they are either high in undesirable resins and oils, such as chestnut, or too porous to be practical, like pine. Oak is low in porosity, making it dense enough to contain liquids, yet it can be easily bent into rounded shapes. It also has an acceptable tannin content and mild aromatic compounds that harmonize intrinsically with wine. More than 99.9 percent of wine barrels are made of oak, as are those used for whiskies and brandies.\n\nOak barrels were first used by the Romans for the practical purpose of transporting wine. These convenient vessels proved able to boost wine's flavor and texture.\n\n**TOM STEVENSON** is the author of *The New Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopedia*, widely considered to be the standard industry reference for the wine trade. He is also the world's foremost authority on the wines of Champagne. He has written prolifically about wine for more than 30 years, producing 23 critically acclaimed books and receiving 30 awards for wine writing. An occasional contributor to *Decanter* magazine and columnist for *The World of Fine Wine* and the online magazine *Wine-pages*, he is founding editor of DK’s ground-breaking *Wine Report* books, an annual series detailing the state of the wine world.\n\n---\n\n**WINE SECRETS** (Page 32)\n\n---"

The key points about \"Gran reservas\" from the document are as follows:\n\n- **Rarity and Production**: Gran reservas are extremely rare, constituting only 1 to 10 percent of all wines produced annually.\n- **Types**: The document mentions two types of gran reservas:\n  - **White Gran Reservas**: These are uncommon and currently produced by only a handful of bodegas.\n  - **Red Gran Reservas**: These are described as elegant, silky, and refined.\n- **Aging Process**: Gran reservas are aged the longest among wines, in the oldest and most neutral barrels. While the law requires a minimum of five years of aging, in practice, they may be aged for much longer.\n\nThese wines are distinct not only due to their limited production but also because of their extended aging process, which contributes significantly to their refined qualities."

Below are the detailed content structures illustrated within the image:\n\n### Baechu Kimchi Aroma Profile\n\n**Text Explanation:**\n- While the oniony odor of cabbage is prominent in Baechu Kimchi, it also features notes of spicy gochugaru paste, fish heat, and a red-bell-pepper-like nuance. Ginger adds a citrusy, floral touch, while salted shrimp gives a roasted dimension. Fermentation processes alter aroma molecule concentrations, introducing methional (potato-like smell), butanoic acid (cheese-like), and a buttery scent of diacetyl. Amino acids and lactobacilli in the kimchi facilitate fermentation, helping balance the spiciness and garlic odour, tempering the strong garlic presence.\n\n### Circular Graph Legend:\nThe circular graph depicts various flavor categories with specific flavors radiating from the center:\n\n- **Herbaceous**: Kale, asparagus, bell pepper\n- **Animal**: Cheesy\n- **Spicy**: Chilli\n- **Ferments**: Beer\n- **Roast notes**: Malt\n- **Oily Fats**: Butter\n- **Sweet Aromatics**: Vanilla, maple\n- **Aldehydic**: Cilantro, floral\n- **Allium**: Onion, garlic, mushroom\n- **Sulfurous**: Broccoli, red bell pepper\n\n### Baechu Kimchi Flavor Compatibility:\n\nBelow the circular graph is a table showing the compatibility of Baechu Kimchi with other foods, using a color-coded system to indicate varying degrees of flavor matching:\n\n```markdown\n| Food Item         | Total Smell | Animal | Balsamic | Burnt | Caramellic | Citrus | Fermented | Floral | Fruity | Green | Maritime | Nutty | Spicy | Sulfurous | Sweet |\n|--------------------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Roast Chicken     | ••••         | •      | •••      | •     | •          |        | ••         |        | •      |       |          | •••   | ••••  | •         | •     |\n| Red Sorrel        | ••           |        |          |       | •          | ••     |            | ••     | •      | •••   |          |       | •     |           |       |\n| Melon             | ••           |        |          |       |            | •      | •           | ••     | •••    | •     |          |       | •     |           | •••   |\n| Pear              | •••          |        |          |       | •          | •      | ••          | ••     | ••••   | ••    |          |       | •     |           | •••   |\n| Bottarga          | ••           | ••     |          |       |            |        | ••          |        |        |       | ••••     |       |       | ••••       |       |\n| Dill              | •••          |        |          |       |            |        | •           | ••     |        | ••••  |          |       | •••   |           |       |\n| Colombian Coffee  | ••           | •      |          | •••   | ••••       | •      |             |        |        |       |          | ••    |       |           | •     |\n| Roast Wild Boar   | •••          | •••    |          | •     | •          |        | ••          |        | •      |       |          | •••   | ••    | •         | •     |\n| Lemon Balm        | •            |        |          |       |            | ••     | •           | •••    | •      | ••    |          |       | •     |           | •     |\n| Pan-Fried King Prawn | •••       | •      |          |       | •          | ••     | ••          | •      | ••     | •     | ••••     |       | •     | •         | •     |\n```\n\nLegend for compatibility: 1 dot signifies mild compatibility, and increasing number of dots up to 4 signifies stronger compatibility.\n\nThis image presents a comprehensive overview of the flavors and food compatibilities associated with Baechu Kimchi, utilizing visual and textual elements to inform the reader."

The text notes that crosses and hybrids have been included for reference purposes, though they make up a small part of the modern industry. Below is the structured content for each category:\n\n### WHITES\n- **CAYUGA**: A French-American hybrid, Cayuga is often used in off-dry blends and for dessert wines.\n- **CHARDONNAY**: A major grape; the good to very good wines it becomes are leaner in style than California chardonnays.\n- **GEWÜRZTRAMINER**: One of New York's best-kept secrets, it can be turned into delicious wines reminiscent of the gewürztraminers of Alsace.\n- **NIAGARA**: Foxy-tasting American cross that is often made into off-dry and dessert wines. It was first bred in the 1860s by growers in Niagara County, New York.\n- **RIESLING**: A major grape that makes many dynamic, vibrant dry wines, as well as delicious off-dry and dessert wines. Most of the best examples of riesling come from the Finger Lakes.\n- **SEYVAL BLANC**: A major French-American hybrid that is used on its own and in blends. Can make good-tasting, dry wines.\n- **VIDAL**: A French-American hybrid; a source of dry wines and some exceptional icewines.\n- **VIGNOLES**: A somewhat rare French-American hybrid also known as Ravat 51; used for dry wines and some tasty icewines.\n\n### REDS\n- **BACO NOIR**: A French-American hybrid that makes simple, fruity red wines that aren’t particularly foxy.\n- **CABERNET FRANC**: A major grape that is often blended with merlot and cabernet sauvignon for Bordeaux-style reds.\n- **CABERNET SAUVIGNON**: Often blended with merlot to create Bordeaux-style reds. Only a modest number of producers, notably on Long Island, use it as a single varietal.\n- **CATAWBA**: A cross or hybrid (the genetic history is unclear) that was very popular in the American Northeast in the nineteenth century. It makes spicy, grapey, high-acid, light red and rosé wines.\n- **CONCORD**: A native grape belonging to the labrusca species, it was first grown from seed in Massachusetts along the Concord River. It is the most widely planted grape in New York State, although most of the production is used for grape juice and jelly, not wine. The remainder is used to make sweet kosher wines and fortified wines.\n- **MERLOT**: A major grape, merlot can become sleek, berried wines that range from good to delicious, especially those produced on Long Island.\n- **PINOT NOIR**: Generally used for New York's numerous sparkling wines.\n\nThis organized categorization of grape varieties offers an overview of the wine grape cultivation and wine production typical to New York State."

It also delves into the specific uses and importance of these forests in the context of wine making.\n\n### Main Points Covered in the Document:\n\n1. **Historical Significance of Oak Forests in France:**\n   - In the Middle Ages, more than two-thirds of France was covered in oak forests.\n   - These forests began to rapidly disappear as the twelfth century dawned due to the need for wood in iron smelting and shipbuilding.\n   - In 1285, Philippe I nationalized the country's forests to ensure a supply for national defense, establishing the Bureau of Water and Forestry.\n\n2. **Current State of Oak Forests:**\n   - Today, 25 percent of the land in France is covered by nationally owned oak forests, totaling about 35 million acres (14 million hectares).\n   - These forests are managed by the Office National des Forêts and are considered one of the country's greatest economic assets.\n\n3. **Economic Impact:**\n   - The French oak forest management shows no signs of decline, nor does the price of a French oak barrel.\n\n4. **Stabilization and Aging of White Wines:**\n   - Discusses the process of cold stabilization for most white wines, where the wine is chilled to slightly above freezing for several days to shock the wine and form small, snowflake-like crystals.\n   - Details the aging process of some white wines using oak, which is typically shorter than red wines but profoundly impacts the flavor.\n\n5. **Anthropomorphic Comparison in Wine Aging:**\n   - Describes how long oak aging can make white wine less delicate and more overt in wood and vanilla flavors, comparing it to a \"small-built woman wearing tons of makeup and a huge fur coat.\"\n\n6. **Wine Fining and Bottling:**\n   - White wine, like red, may undergo fining or filtering to stabilize and clarify the wine further before bottling, with some wines receiving further aging in the bottle.\n\nThis thorough examination outlines not only the historical and economic importance of oak forests in France but also ties these aspects closely to the wine industry, showcasing how oak aging affects the characteristics of white wines in particular."

A quick dinner on a time-pressed weeknight will be different from a dinner made on the weekend when there is more time to enjoy the sensual process of cooking. Keep the occasion in mind when planning your meal, with the knowledge that any meal can be elevated to a special occasion — or simplified in a crunch. The elements of breakfast take on a different level of importance when they are used for a special brunch. A quick fried egg and a toasted English muffin on a Tuesday can morph into poached eggs with Canadian bacon with hollandaise sauce on an English muffin for a weekend brunch, or vice versa.\n\nBut a true special occasion — a birthday, anniversary, or holiday — definitely calls for something equally special to celebrate it. If lack of time is a factor, a birthday isn’t the time to undertake making and decorating a cake from scratch. However, it might inspire you to pick up a half gallon of the birthday boy or girl’s favorite ice cream, toast some pecans, and whip up some homemade chocolate sauce — which would take only minutes, as opposed to hours."

Here’s the content structured in a readable format:\n\n---\n\n### Aperture Variability and Dasher Bottles\nThe document explains that the aperture size of bitters bottles can vary significantly between companies, affecting the amount of liquid dispensed with each dash. A general guideline given is that one dash from a plastic-topped bottle is equal to three dashes from a Japanese dasher bottle. When using recipes from this book, a dash from a dasher bottle is the standard measure, but if using a Japanese dasher bottle, it is recommended to triple the number of dashes.\n\n### Japanese Dasher Bottles\nFor those who make their own bitters or tinctures, investing in Japanese dasher bottles is highly recommended for uniformity in dash sizes. The document notes that these bottles not only ensure uniform dashes of any bitters but also have an aesthetic appeal, likening them to tiny crystal decanters.\n\n### Speed Pourers\nSpeed pourers, contrary to what their name might suggest, provide a slower, more consistent stream of liquid, decreasing waste once the user becomes adept at their use. They are described as not absolutely necessary for a home bartender but beneficial for practice or heavy use. At the bar Death & Co, bottles on the back bar retain their decorative caps, but those in the speed rack and on the cheater bottles on the bar top use speed pourers to handle about 90 percent of the alcohol served, underlining their practicality in busy bar settings.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured presentation highlights the key tools discussed in the document along with their purpose and recommendations on usage."

Situation des locaux**\n  \n  Le chai est semi-enterré comme vu au 1.2.a.\n\n  **b. Description des équipements d'élevage et du travail du vin**\n  \n  - **Entonnage**\n  \n    L'entonnage se réalise lorsque les vins sont soutirés et stabilisés (fermentations alcooliques et malolactiques achevées) entre novembre et décembre. L'opération est effectuée avec une pompe «tono chez techocompope» et une canne plongeante pour une intégration douce dans le fût. Le chai se compose de 10 barriques de 225 L, 3 barriques de 300 L et une barrique de 500 L, pour une totalité de 14 fûts. Ils sont positionnés «bonde vers le haut». Les fûts ne souhaitent pas une empreinte de bois marquée sur les vins. Les fûts doivent garder 5 ans et renouvelés ensuite. \n\n    Les fûts sont en bois de chêne et d'acacia, issus de la tonnellerie Fouailly. Tous les autres sont en chêne (Quercus petraea), avec un cerclage en acier. Les tonnelles produisent des vins « François Frères » (Bourgogne) et « Saint Martin » (Sud Ouest). La chauffe des fûts est minimale, pour mieux conserver le caractère fruité de la cuvée (objectif d’un apport de « sucrosité», de structure et de lactones). Les bondes sont en silicone, s'adaptant à tout diamètre des trous de bondes.\n\n  - **Entretien des barriques**\n  \n    Le nettoyage des barriques se fait avant et après l'utilisation pour le vin. Cette période est normalement à éviter, surtout avant la mise en vente des bouteilles. L'entretien des barriques vides se fait par un méchage de soufre tous les trois mois. Pour l’insertion du vin en fût, les barriques sont nettoyées à l’aide d’un générateur de vapeur électrique (Modèle Multivap basic de la marque MOOOG), lié à un mécanisme régulant le suivi d’introduction des fûts par le trou de la bonde. La temporisation des cycles de nettoyage permet d'utiliser un timer pour le rinçage, après lequel le lavage se termine par une canne de lavage à fûts.\n\n  **c. Description des itinéraires d'élevage : barrique/cuve**\n  \n    Aucun assemblage n'est réalisé avant la mise en fût (cette opération étant anticipée dès la mise en cuve dès/juste après la vendange). Trois garde-vins de deux hectolitres permettent l’ouillage des barriques par conteneurée de roupe (Bête, Etraire et Persan). L’ouillage est réalisé plusieurs fois par jour à l'envolée (temps d'humidification du fût), deux fois par semaine durant le premier mois et une fois par semaine ensuite. Le but étant de limiter le contact de la surface du vin avec l'air. L'apport d’oxygène souhaité est en effet de l'ordre de la micro-oxygénation. La « Bête » prend 3 à 6 mois d'élevage en fût et les cuvées « Persan », Etraire sont similaires.\n\n---\n\nThis summary captures the specific practices and equipment details described for wine aging and handling in the winery as outlined in the document."

It is noted that high temperatures will destroy these delicate flavors, so it is recommended to add basil to dishes at the very last moment.\n\n### Aroma Wheel (Graphic Representation)\n- Divided into various segments indicating categories such as:\n  - **Cloves**\n  - **Spicy** \n  - **Green** \n  - **Fresh** \n  - **Floral** \n  - **Lemon** \n  - **Peppery**\n  - **Camphor**\n  - It is a circular diagram with varying intensities of spice, camphor, floral, citrus, and other aroma notes related to basil.\n\n### Aroma Grid\n- Displays the aroma profiles of basil compared to other ingredients:\n  - **Ingredients:**\n    1. Cooked adzuki bean\n    2. Anise hyssop\n    3. Spanish chorizo\n    4. Boiled mitten crab\n    5. Lemon tart\n    6. Cooked green lentils\n    7. Boiled brown crab\n    8. Roast lamb fillet\n    9. Cardamom seeds\n    10. Bleu d'Auvergne\n\n- **Aroma Attributes:**\n  - Floral, Herbal, Nutty, Cooked, Roasted, Sweet, Woody, Caramel, Earthy, Anise, Citrus, Mint, Peppery, Green, Spicy, Camphor, Clove.\n\n- Each ingredient's profile is displayed with colored dots indicating the presence of these aroma compounds with varying intensity or absence.\n\nOverall, the document visually and textually elaborates on the complex aroma profile of basil by comparing it with other food ingredients and providing specifics on which aroma compounds are most prominent in basil."

If mold is found only in one or two pockets, it might be isolated and removed, but widespread mold throughout the miso may require its disposal.\n   - To prevent such issues, it is crucial to pack miso firmly in its fermentation vessel to avoid the formation of air pockets that lead to mold growth."

Below is an outlined structured content of each section:\n\n### THE MYTH OF CABERNET AND CHOCOLATE\n- **Introductory Remarks**:\n  - Cabernet and chocolate often seem like an ideal pairing.\n  - Chocolate has \"extremely powerful, profound, and complex flavor\" that accentuates tannin in cabernet.\n  - The richness of chocolate contrasts with the subtleness required to balance its flavor with cabernet.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - The intense flavor of chocolate makes many dry wines taste sour.\n  - Chocolate needs a powerful and fruity wine as a partner.\n  - Port wine, which is sweet, luscious, and opulent, is suggested as a better pairing than cabernet.\n\n### CHARDONNAY\n- **Introduction to Chardonnay**:\n  - Chardonnay is one of the most successful white wines globally.\n  - Known for its appealing flavors including vanilla, butter, and butterscotch.\n  - Described as \"the Marilyn Monroe of white grapes,\" most chardonnays are creamy, lush, and full-bodied.\n  - Chablis, made of 100% chardonnay, is noted as a noteworthy exception.\n\n- **Historical Context**:\n  - Popularity of chardonnay gained traction around the mid-1960s.\n  - Initially very little chardonnay was produced, mostly in California, with limited global spread.\n  - Originated from Burgundy, France, believed to be a natural cross of the white grape gouais blanc with red grape pinot noir.\n  - Inspired global wine production, although traditionally smaller in scale compared to its later popularity.\n\n- **Modern Perspective and Critique**:\n  - Seen as a “winemaker’s wine\" due to its adaptability to various winemaking techniques.\n  - Techniques include barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation, and sur lie aging.\n  - There is critique about over-manipulation leading to wines that are \"diffused, flabby, overoaked, and overdone.\"\n  - Despite such criticisms, the finest chardonnays are considered very high-quality.\n\nThis detailed summary reflects the content and themes presented in the document regarding the relationship and characteristics of cabernet, chocolate, and chardonnay."

It describes how great wines stand out from the ordinary through their enduring flavors and textures, much like cashmere stands out among sweaters. The intensity and duration of the finish are highlighted as key aspects to consider when judging a wine’s quality. The analogy of toasting with fine crystal versus everyday glassware is used to illustrate the quality resonance in wines.\n\n2. **Marnie’s Corner**\n   - In this section, there's a narrative about the common pitfalls that wine novices face, such as doubting their own judgment and adopting preferences influenced by others. It emphasizes that individual perceptions of wine vary and that people's tastes evolve over time. It advises against feeling pressured into pretending to like certain wines and encourages embracing one's true preferences, regardless of price or perceived sophistication.\n\nOverall, the document aims to educate on appreciating wine’s qualities, particularly the finish, and encourages a personalized and evolving approach to wine tasting."

Below is the translation and structured summary of the content:\n\n### Title: Faux soja\n\n**Subtitle:** Often mistakenly called \"soja,\" these legumes deserve some clarification.\n\n**Content:**\n\n1. **Mung Beans and Mung Bean Sprouts**: Often referred to as \"ambérique vert\" and \"moog\" in Hindi, they are commonly called \"soja vert.\" Despite their appearance, which is similar to the oval shape of green soybeans, they are distinct from soybeans. These are actually mung beans or their sprouts, which are not types of soybeans despite their common mislabeling.\n\n2. **Decorticated Lentils**: Sometimes mistakenly termed \"black soy\" or \"black lentils,\" these belong to a color group when left whole, which makes them one of the most appreciated legumes in India. They can be decorticated, in which case they are black, and their texture slightly mucilaginous when cooked. They are often used in dishes such as dosas and other patties.\n\n**Visual Content Description:**\n- Two bowls at the top of the image contain legumes believed to be associated with the descriptions:\n  1. A bowl of green mung beans or sprouts.\n  2. A bowl of light-colored decorticated lentils.\n- Sprouted mung beans are depicted below the bowls, lying loose on the textured fabric background.\n\nThis informative excerpt clarifies common misconceptions about specific legumes often mistaken for soy products, highlighting details about their true nature and culinary uses."

It's highly sensitive to climate changes and has a complex soil composition requirement. It easily oxidizes during winemaking.\n- **Appeal**: Despite the challenges it presents to the winemaker and the wine drinker, its unpredictability and complexity make it fascinating and irresistible.\n- **Region Specifity**: Bourgundy, France, is historically significant for pinot noir; wines from this region, especially from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, are notably expensive with some vintages commanding high prices.\n- **New World Production**: Oregon has been known for its high-quality pinot noir since the 1970s. Other notable regions include California’s Santa Maria Valley, Sta. Rita Hills, and central regions up to Sonoma Coast. New Zealand is also emerging as a producing region.\n\n**Riesling**\n- **Characteristics**: Riesling is esteemed by many experts as a noble and unique white grape variety. Originated from the Rheingau region of Germany, it is known for its vivid purity, soaring acidity, and flavorful delicacy.\n- **Taste Profile**: Riesling has a light, graceful presence on the palate with a vibrant mineral quality reminiscent of water running over stones.\n- **Winemaking**: Riesling wines are marked by high acidity and low alcohol which yield flavorful and delicate wines. They often have flavors of fresh ripe peaches, apricots, and melons.\n- **Geographical Variance**: Rieslings thrive in various climates, from cool regions in Germany, France, Austria, and Canada to warmer areas like Washington State. The taste and character can differ significantly based on the climate.\n\nBoth descriptions outline the unique characteristics, geographical importance, and sensory profiles of Pinot Noir and Riesling, emphasizing their special status in the wine world through both historical context and modern appreciation."

Below, I've detailed the essential content of each section in a structured manner.\n\n### Juice Extraction Devices Overview\n\n#### Citrus Juicing\n- For citrus fruits, the text suggests that observing a particular juicer in action is mesmerizing. Don, who appears to be a person familiar to the author, uses it to make lime and lemon juice for cocktails.\n- It is recommended to strain citrus juice through a fine chinois or tea strainer to prevent pulp bits from appearing in cocktail glasses.\n\n#### Juicers for Larger Citrus\n- For larger citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruits, the author recommends using a vertical lever-pulled press, specifically the OrangeX or its equivalent.\n- A heavy-duty model is suggested because cheaper models tend to break.\n- The recommended juicer also works for pomegranates.\n\n#### Juicers for Other Fruits and Vegetables\n- The author uses the Champion Juicer for juicing hard fruits and vegetables, such as apples and carrots.\n- This juicer is described as durable, capable of continuous operation even under tough conditions, like juicing six cases of apples consecutively.\n- The Champion Juicer has issues with overheating, as indicated by incidents of steam emitting during extensive use.\n- It is effective for juicing not just typical fruits but also wheatgrass, sugarcane, horseradish, and ginger.\n- For those considering a business investment in juicing, the author recommends the Nutrifaster juicer, noted for requiring significant manual effort but offering high-efficiency juicing. It is pricier and larger than the Champion Juicer.\n\n#### Blenders\n- The author prefers Vita-Prep high-speed blenders for their ease of use and effective design.\n- Features include two paddle switches and a knob for control, which are particularly noted for their intuitiveness and reliability.\n- An alternative for non-commercial use is the Vitamix, which is similar to the Vita-Prep but geared towards home use, offering a better warranty and a more affordable price.\n\nOverall, the document serves as a guide or a recommendation list for selecting juicers and blenders for both home and commercial use, emphasizing durability, efficiency, and user-friendliness."

We have a tendency to judge a wine store by the size of its selection, but this can be a misleading metric. Often the very best wine stores are those with a small, but carefully selected roster of offerings. In these circumstances, it’s more likely that each and every wine has been vetted thoroughly and that each wine fills a stylistic need. So, don’t judge quality by quantity—wait until you’ve tried a few of their wines before deciding whether or not to go back. In fact, asking for a mixed case of recommendations is a great way to get a handle on whether or not your retailer is up to snuff.\n\n---\n\n**Page 80**  \n**Wine Secrets**"

Drain well, transfer to a clean dish towel, and pat dry. (If the corn is too wet it will weaken the final polenta).\n\n2. **Baking Sheet:**\n   - Lightly oil a small baking sheet.\n\n3. **Cooking Polenta:**\n   - In a heavy saucepan, combine the cornmeal and 4 cups cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cook the polenta, stirring often, until thickened and no longer gritty, about 30 minutes. \n   - When the polenta is done, stir in the corn kernels, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour onto the prepared sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead of time. After the polenta has set, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)\n\n4. **Caramelizing Onions:**\n   - In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the red onions and sauté for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to low and sauté another 10 minutes until lightly golden and caramelized.\n\n5. **Serving:**\n   - Preheat the grill or broiler. Cut the polenta into 8 triangles or strips. Grill or broil until golden brown around the edges, turning once, about 5 minutes total. Alternatively, heat the oven to 350 degrees, place the polenta on an oiled baking sheet, and heat until warm, about 10 minutes.\n   - Transfer the polenta to individual salad plates. Top with strips of smoked fish and caramelized onions, dividing evenly. Drizzle with crème fraîche and sprinkle with minced chives. \n\n**Page Number:**\n- 62"

It appears to focus on the historical and cultural significance of plant-based diets and the evolution of such diets over time. Below, the content is broken down into structured sections based on the document's headings and subheadings:\n\n### Edible Plants\n\n#### Plant Adaptation\n\n- **Transformation of Environment:** Plants transform their environment (water, rock, air, light) into food, which all animal life depends on. They defend themselves from threats and attract allies using colors, tastes, and scents, intrinsic to our perceptions of beauty and deliciousness.\n  \n#### Human Plant Diet Evolution\n\n- **Historical Context:** Humans have always been plant eaters. Early ancestors were omnivorous and foraged wild fruits, leaves, and seeds.\n- **Agriculture Development:** The domestication of certain plants around 10,000 years ago allowed early humans control over food supply, leading to the establishment of fields, settlements, and the first cities.\n\n#### Impact of Culture and Technology\n\n- **Changes Over Time:** Initially, a diverse plant culture was typical, influenced by mythology and symbolism. However, industrialization and later technological advancements reduced plant variety in diets.\n- **Modern Trends:** Currently, there is a renaissance in understanding the importance of a diverse diet rich in plant foods, aided by modern technologies that unlock the potential to explore a vast array of edible plants.\n\n#### The Original Food\n\n- **Cultural Roots:** The document presents the idea that plant foods are historically considered \"original\" and proper foods, deeply rooted in cultural traditions like the Greek and Roman myths and the Biblical Genesis story describing the Garden of Eden.\n\n#### Biblical Context and Ethical Eating\n\n- **Ethical Considerations:** Post the biblical narrative of Cain's killing of Abel, many opted to avoid animal foods. This highlights an ethical preference for plant-based diets among various groups and individuals throughout history due to the lower resource cost of plant foods compared to meat."

Below are the extracts structured in key sections:\n\n---\n\n### Potato Preparation Methods\n\n#### Deep-Frying Potatoes\n- **Process**: Potatoes are initially fried at a relatively low temperature (250-325°F/120-163°C) for 8-10 minutes, then the temperature is increased to 350-375°F/175-190°C for another 3-4 minutes for a crispy exterior.\n- **Efficiency**: The method involves pre-frying all the potato strips at a lower temperature, setting them aside, then finishing with high-temperature frying briefly at the end.\n\n#### Potato Chips\n- **Description**: Potato chips are described as being \"all crust and no interior,\" typically 1.5 mm thick.\n- **Deep-Frying Process**: Sliced potatoes are deep-fried until dry and crisp, undergoing two stages—initial frying at low then elevated to high temperatures (250°F/120°C increasing up to 350°F/175°C within 8-10 minutes).\n- **Texture**: The rapid heat causes starch granules and cell walls to have minimal moisture absorption, giving a harder and crunchier texture to the chips.\n\n#### Soufflé Potatoes\n- **Description**: This variety is made from thin 3 mm slices, deep-fried at a moderate then high temperature.\n- **Cooking Temperatures**: Initially fried at 350°F/175°C and subsequently at around 380°F/195°C.\n- **Resulting Feature**: The intense heat and vapor pressure during the process puff the slices up, creating a hollow center upon cooling.\n\n### Overview of Sweet Potatoes\n\n#### Description\n- **Botanical Name**: *Ipomoea batatas*\n- **Origin and History**: Native to northern South America, spread to Polynesia, Europe, and Asia through historical movements, becoming notably established in China by the 15th century.\n- **Cultural Significance**: China is the leading producer and consumer, with the vegetable being a crucial crop globally.\n\n#### Current Uses and Storage\n- **Varieties**: Ranges from dry and starchy to sweet and dark orange types.\n- **Confusion**: Often confused in the U.S as \"yam\" during marketing campaigns despite being different.\n- **Storage**: Typically stored at 86°F/30°C to heal damaged skin and encourage sugar development.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed breakdown highlights cooking methods for different types of potatoes and provides comprehensive information on the botany and cultural significance of sweet potatoes."

    "contenu": "## Artichoke\n\n### Introduction\nRaw artichokes have a surprisingly complex aroma profile made up of green, herbal, woody mushroom and even fruity, floral rose notes with hints of spicy clove. Cooking them brings out additional roasted and caramellic notes. \n\n### Historical Overview\nThe artichoke likely originated in Sicily and its cultivation can be traced back to ancient times, with significant cultivation by the Greeks and Romans in the 8th century BC. In the Middle Ages in Europe, Arabs who introduced the plant into the Southern Spain, contributing greatly to its spread across other regions. The Renaissance period in Spain further contributed to artichoke cultivation, from where it spread to France and Italy. By the 16th century, it was commonly found throughout Europe and was even considered a delicacy of the French elite.\n\n### Mythological Aspect\nArtichokes are also connected to mythology, notably with a story involving Zeus and a beautiful young woman named Cynara. Zeus, who was infatuated with Cynara, turned her into the first artichoke after she returned to her mortal life, an act of retribution for her desire to return to her mother.\n\n### Modern Cultivation and Varieties\nToday, two plants, unrelated to the mythological Cynara scolymus, but similarly named because of their bitter profile, are the Jerusalem artichokes (Helianthus tuberosus) and the Chinese artichoke (Stachys affinis), the latter sometimes called a crosne. These varieties continue to be popular due to their unique flavors and are eaten mostly in their tuberous form.\n\n### Unique Components\n- **Cynar**: An Italian liqueur made from artichoke leaves and other botanicals, popular for its complexity and used in cocktails like the Cin-Cyn twist on the Negroni.\n\n---\n\n## Artichoke Soup with Chanterelle\n\n### Foodpairing Recipe\nThis soup takes its inspiration from the Provençal artichauts à la barigoule, consisting of artichokes braised in a mix of olive oil, white wine, water, vegetables, and herbs to create a flavorful dish.\n- **Ingredients**: Artichokes, onions, garlic, carrots, celery, leeks, bay leaf, thyme, white wine, vegetable broth\n- **Enhancing Flavors**: Anchovies in oil and candied lemon peel\n- **Serving Suggestions**: Served pureed with a dollop of yogurt, topped with chopped walnuts and sautéed chanterelles to contrast the artichokes' bitter taste.\n\n### Preparation Details\n1. **Sauteéing the Base**: Begin by sautéing onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and leeks with bay leaf and thyme.\n2. **Adding Main Ingredients**: Introduce the artichokes to the pot along with white wine and broth, simmering until the vegetables are tender.\n3. **Blending**: Once cooked, blend the mixture until smooth, adjusting thickness and seasoning as desired.\n4. **Finishing Touches**: Enhance the flavor with olive oil and anchovies, serving hot with added yogurt, walnuts, and sautéed chanterelles. \n\nThis dish combines the earthy profiles of the ingredients with the sophisticated techniques of French culinary methods, making it a refined and flavorful choice for sophisticated diners."

Peel the cucumber, cut it in halves, rinse and dry the halves. Cut into quarters.\n2. Peel the onion and finely chop it.\n3. Mix in a salad bowl: cucumbers, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper.\n4. Add onion, olives, and cubes of feta.\n5. Serve chilled to accompany the saganaki. Reserve in the fridge until ready to serve.\n\n##### For the saganaki:\n1. Cut the cheese into two thick slices. Pass the slices under the roasting pan briefly to slightly dry the surface.\n2. Coat the cheese slices with flour. Discard excess flour.\n3. Preheat a frying pan and add olive oil. Fry the cheese until golden at 1 min 30 sec on each side using a spatula to avoid breaking the cheese slices. \n4. The cheese should be warm but not melted completely. Drain excess oil on absorbent paper.\n5. Cut the lemon into quarters.\n\nServe the saganaki immediately without waiting, allowing your guests to add lemon at the last moment along with the Greek salad.\n\n#### Chef's Tips:\n- Always use hard cheese for saganaki.\n- If kefalotyri is difficult to find, it can be replaced by pecorino or combined with kasseri, memental, or provolone.\n\n#### Good to Know:\n- Saganaki is made in a small, two-handled pan which is specifically for frying cheese, and it shares its name with other dishes prepared in this manner."

    "contenu": "The document presents a series of culinary notes and recipes centered around the uses of cumin in cooking. Here's a structured summary of its content:\n\n### Cumin\n\n#### General Comments\n- **Texture and Flavor:** Unlike anise or coriander seeds, cumin seeds are hard and scarcely pleasant to chew when dry. They possess a woodsy, slightly musty aroma. Upon immersion in cooking, these seeds release warm, cinnamon-like, and nutty flavors, which may evoke a nostalgic sense of spice cupboards or past vacations where curry powder was notable.\n- **Characteristic Combination:** It highlights how cumin seeds, though transformed in the cooking process, offer an undertone of earthiness suitable for a variety of dishes, ranging from sautéed to grilled.\n\n#### Specific Pairing and Recipes\n\n1. **Cumin & Apricot:**\n   - **Dish:** Tajine with apricots.\n   - **Details:** The dish is so rich in ingredients that the floral and fruity notes from the apricots, despite their intense flavor, might not stand out against the spicy cumin. A specific recipe mentioned includes cooking carrots and apricots in olive oil, adding spices, covering with water, and simmering with lentils. Suggested garnish includes chopped dry apricots, salt, and water reduced to a puree.\n\n2. **Cumin & Lamb:** `[See Agneau & Cumin]`\n\n3. **Cumin & Beetroot:**\n   - **Dish:** Beetroot with cumin.\n   - **Details:** Both ingredients share an earthy flavor, but their combination can also offer a delicate complexity, enhanced when the beets are entwined in a whipping action or served with chickpeas and sour cream.\n   \n4. **Cumin & Carrot:** `[See Carotte & Cumin]`\n\n5. **Cumin & Cauliflower:**\n   - **Dish:** Roasted cauliflower and cumin.\n   - **Details:** When roasted together, cumin and cauliflower develop a fruity coat without losing their inherent flavors. The recommendation includes cutting the cauliflower into florets, roasting them with cumin, and serving either blanched or slightly carbonized.\n\nThe descriptions focus on the fusion of flavors, the transformative impact of cooking techniques, and the resulting culinary experiences with cumin as a central theme."

    "contenu": "### China and the Wine Industry: A Modern Resurgence\n\n#### Recent Developments in Chinese Wine Consumption\nA decade ago, the association between China and wine was not evident in the Western world. However, by 2012, China emerged as the fifth leading nation in both wine consumption and production, a significant statistic provided by the International Organization of Wine and Vine (OIV). This is particularly noteworthy considering China harbors around 19 percent of the global population, making it the most populous nation on Earth.\n\n#### Historical Context of Wine in China\nChina's engagement with wine can be traced back thousands of years with the country having a long-standing tradition in winemaking. Archaeological findings in the mid-1990s led by a joint American-Chinese team uncovered evidence of wine production in Shandong Province dating back to 2500 B.C. Artefacts from this era included clay vessels with remnants of wines made from grapes, rice, and honey (mead).\n\n#### Alcohol Consumption in Ancient China\nDuring the Bronze Age (circa 700 B.C.), grape-based wines in China were largely overshadowed by other forms of alcoholic drinks brewed from grains like millet and sorghum, and from fruits such as lychees and Asian plums. Cultural traditions and drinking patterns in ancient times primarily featured these beverages, and it wasn't until the modern era that grape wine made significant returns. As of the 1970s, the dominant alcoholic beverages were beer and spirits, with beer and baijiu (a potent spirit made from sorghum) constituting 99% of the alcohol consumption.\n\n#### Brief Overview of China's Political and Economic History\nThe foundation of the Chinese Empire dates back to 221 B.C. with the Qin Dynasty. It saw numerous dynasties until 1911 when the Republic of China was established after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. Post World War II, internal conflicts led to the rise of the Communist Party in 1949. In 1978, under the Communist regime, China underwent significant economic reforms that catalyzed its development into a major global power.\n\nThis recap provides a fundamental understanding of the rise in China's wine industry, set against the backdrop of its vast historical and cultural heritage."

The Maori developed a concept called **kaitiakitanga**, which means \"guardianship.\" When westerners arrived in large numbers at the end of the eighteenth century, they quickly adopted the Maori way of thinking. Today, one-third of the island nation’s land is owned by the government and protected against development.\n\nAlthough the Maori had no written language, Christian missionaries in the nineteenth century recorded the words the Maori spoke. Today, many towns, wineries, and even vineyards have Maori names. The Maori name for New Zealand, **Aotearoa**, means \"land of the long white cloud.\"\n\n### Wine Regions and Production\n\nIn the southeast corner of the North Island, near New Zealand’s capital, Wellington, is the small wine region Wairarapa/Martinborough. The region has approximately two dozen high-quality producers who make a variety of good wines. Noteworthy are their pinot noirs, which have gained international reputation in recent years, from producers like Ata Rangi, Martinborough Vineyard, Dry River, Schubert Wines, and Craggy Range.\n\nCompared to the North Island, the South Island is even cooler and was very rural until relatively recently. No commercial vineyards existed there until 1973. That year, Montana Wines planted vines in Marlborough, on the northeastern tip of the South Island, marking the beginning of what would later become one of the most prestigious wine districts in the country. In 2005, Montana Wines was absorbed into the larger French conglomerate Pernod Ricard (and renamed Brancott Estate). Today, Marlborough represents 60 percent of all New Zealand vineyards and produces 70 percent of all New Zealand wine and 80 percent of all New Zealand sauvignon blanc. Other notable wines from the region include those from Cloudy Bay, Greywacke, Wairau River, and Villa Maria. There is also a growing production of pinot gris and riesling in the area.\n\n---\n\n**Caption for image in the document:**\n*In Central Otago, pinot noir vines are covered in nets to prevent birds from eating the grapes.*"

    "contenu": "### MARRYING WELL: WINE AND FOOD\n\nSince its origins approximately eight thousand years ago, wine has always had a constant, delicious companion: food. For most of European history, little distinction was drawn between the two. Wine **was** food. A solace. A source of calories. As intimate a part of life as breathing.\n\nThat we’ve come to a time when we need guidance on the marrying of these two primal forces is an intriguing conversation in itself. But here, my purpose is different. Here, I hope to remind us all about affinities. And set the course for some thrilling combinations.\n\nLet me begin by admitting that I don’t think every wine always needs to be perfectly matched to a food, or vice versa. And I don’t say this because I lack passion for food. Flavor is flavor. It doesn’t matter to me if it’s liquid or solid in my mouth. Moreover, I started out as a food (not a wine) writer; I love to cook, and as you will perhaps deduce from the many food scenes scattered throughout the chapters of this book, I have a deep appreciation for the historic connection between the foods of a place and the wines of a place. Together the two allow us, however briefly, to actually participate in the culture of a place. And that, it seems to me, is one of the true gifts wine and food offer us.\n\n> “The food was average but the meal was great.”\n> — ANDREW JEFFORD, writing about a meal in The New France\n\nWine and food matching is a bit different. In the United States, beginning in the 1980s, wine and food pairing became something of a national sport. Restaurants offered wine and food dinners; food magazines began to suggest wines with certain recipes; the back labels on bottles of American wines began to suggest accompanying dishes (although one of the first wineries to do this in the world was Napa Valley’s Beaulieu Vineyard, back in the 1960s). It was all very exciting.\n\nBut as time went on, what started out as an exploration meant to heighten enjoyment began to take the form of just another set of “rules” complex enough to make anyone dizzy. Acidity contrasts with salt. Salt fights with fat. Umami decreases bitterness. And on and on.\n\nThe problem with this sort of approach is that it has very little connection—today or historically—to how we actually behave when we cook, eat, and drink. A hundred years ago, did an Italian grandmother stop to consider the acidity level in her pasta sauce before choosing a wine for dinner? I doubt it. Admittedly, she had very little choice; only a limited selection of wines would have been available to her. But it’s also true that, both then and now, we sometimes choose wines as much to match the mood as the food. Sometimes maybe more so. All of this is simply to point out that wine and food don’t always have to be technically perfect together to be delicious anyway.\n\nThat said, it’s certainly true that extraordinary flavor affinities do exist, and that most of us have had at least a few of those “wow” moments when the wine-and-food combination truly transcends."

Start by warming the starter yogurt to room temperature.\n  2. Prepare containers and an incubator (or insulated cooler) by filling them with warm water to maintain a conducive environment for fermentation.\n\n### Challenges and Tips\n- **Incubation:** Maintaining the required temperature during the incubation is crucial and is described as one of the most challenging aspects of the process. Specific details and strategies for incubation are covered in another section referred to as \"chapter 3\".\n\n### Summary Advice\n- **Resource Management:** If milk is abundant, experimenting with spontaneous fermentation is suggested; however, if milk is scarce, it is advised to use a reliable starter culture to ensure the desired outcome.\n\nThe document also briefly emphasizes the unique features of different styles of fermented milks and encourages trying different fermentation methods based on the availability of resources."

    "contenu": "Title: **Marnie's Corner**\n\n**Content:**\n\nSweetness is a major wine style factor, and it ranks among the first characteristics we learn to recognize. Most wine drinkers have a clear preference for either drier or sweeter wines, and they are frustrated that wines are rarely marked clearly. In fact, terms like **dry** may appear on the labels of wines that are anything but. If salsa can be labeled mild, medium, and hot, why not label wines **dry, off-dry, and sweet**? This proposition may sound sensible, but vintners resist referring to sweetness on labels unless doing so is established regional tradition. One problem is that there is little agreement on where to draw the line. Not only do individuals perceive sweetness differently, but cultures do as well. Wines considered dry in the United States may seem sugary to Italians. Food context is a major factor; sugar in food makes wine taste dramatically drier, and American food is sweeter than the cuisine of most countries. However, widespread among consumers is the erroneous association of sweetness with low quality. That perception is entirely inaccurate; there are, of course, world-class off-dry and sweet wines. But since cheap wines are often sugary and premium wines are often dry, it is sad but true that advertising sweetness can have a negative impact on perceived quality.\n\n**Footer:** Page 56 from **Wine Secrets**"

Code of Commerce).\n- Sales using the \"à la ficelle\" method (measuring remaining wine in the bottle to determine consumption).\n- The sale of wine allows the possibility of taking an unfinished bottle home, encouraging more liberal purchasing even if alone.\n- This system is also advantageous for the restaurateur who sells the wine by the bottle or by the \"half-bottle.\"\n- The possibility of bringing your own wine without a corkage fee, “prix d’appel” to compose the surrounding atmosphere at the client’s table.\n\nThe quoted text at the bottom states: \n*'Le prix coûtant' is the actual purchase price and is the unit price listed on a large majority of taxes for the business's volume of sales, specific taxes related to this revenue and the price of transport - Code de Commerce, article L. 442-2, alinéa 2.*(This explains how actual purchase price relates to various commercial practices.)\n\nThis section explains various practices and nuances in the pricing and selling of wine in a commercial context, particularly within restaurants or similar venues. It also mentions legal references from the \"Code de Commerce\", indicating the legal framework under which these practices operate."

The document seems to be a glossary related to winemaking and wine terminology.\n\n### C\n- **COOPERAGE**: Containers a winery uses for storing wine, usually barrels or wood casks, though the term cooperage can also apply to concrete or stainless-steel vessels.\n- **CORDON**: A permanent woody arm that is trained horizontally from the trunk of the vine. The cordon will support the SHOOTS and grape clusters.\n- **CORKED**: A term used to describe a wine that smells like a wet dog in a basement or sometimes, like wet cardboard, when certain bacteria in the cork cells interact with minute amounts of chemical residues that may remain in corks or wine bottles after they are cleaned. A corked wine has a defective AROMA and flavor, although it will not harm the drinker.\n- **CROSS**: A grape created by fertilizing one genetic variety of grape with another genetic variety that belongs to the same species. \n- **CRUSH**: Used as a verb, it means to break the grape skins so that the juice can more easily begin. As a noun, crush is the general term used for all of the steps (e.g., harvesting) that take place just prior to fermentation.\n- **CUTTING**: A segment of a dormant CANE 14 to 18 inches long that is cut off a growing vine and used to propagate a new plant through GRAFTING or direct planting.\n\n### D\n- **DECANT**: The act of pouring a wine (generally an older wine) off any SEDIMENT or deposits that may have precipitated out and settled in the bottle.

Below is a detailed summary of the content:\n\n**Bottle Gourds**\n- Known as calabashes or cucuzze by Italians.\n- Commonly dried for making containers or ornaments.\n- Immature fruits are peeled, cooked, and enjoyed as a bland vegetable relish.\n\n**Luffa or Angled Gourds (Chinese Okra)**\n- Elongated fruits with prominent ridges, mostly eaten when immature.\n- Used to make natural “sponges” from fibrous, mature gourds.\n\n**Winter or Wax or Fuzzy Melons**\n- Known for a protective wax on the rinds that can be made into candles.\n- Young fruits have wax-producing glands more prominent than the wax itself.\n- Often termed as hairy or fuzzy gourds or melons. The flesh turns translucent when cooked and is used in festive soups.\n\n**Chayote or Mirliton**\n- Squash that seems like a squash, resembling a large pear.\n- Originates from a Central American vine, with a single large seed and tender flesh.\n- Takes longer to cook, used similarly to summer squashes and can be stuffed.\n\n**The Bean Family: Fresh Beans and Peas**\n- Unlike most edible fruits, these were not designed to appeal to seed-dispersing animals.\n- These plants are categorized as legumes.\n- Pods of certain legumes (such as green beans, fava beans, lima beans, and soybeans) are consumed before they dry out, providing a fresh, green, nutrient-rich food source.\n- Green beans specifically are a notable example, coming from a climbing plant native to Central America and the northern Andes.\n\n**Pods Formation and Nutrient Storage**\n- Green bean seeds are tasty because they accumulate sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n- During maturation, these nutrients are transformed into starch and proteins, and the green pods serve as a temporary storage depot.\n- After harvesting, the pods lose sweetness, formulating the basis of their culinary use."

They exhibit pronounced aromas of dried fruit, coffee, and licorice.\n  \n### Muscat\n- **Characteristics:** Similar to PX in some ways but retains a varietal dried citrus peel character.\n\n### Sweetened Styles\n1. **Pale Cream** \n   - **Aging:** Short period of biological aging before sweetening, typically with RCGM (Rectified Concentrated Grape Must).\n   - **Appearance:** Similar to Fino.\n   - **Character:** Generally does not have a pronounced flor character.\n\n### Medium and Cream \n- **Type:** A diverse category ranging from inexpensive to very premium wines. \n- **Aging:** Must show characteristics from both biological and oxidative aging.\n- **Flavor Profile:** Sweetened with PX wine, balancing between premium wine and sweet wine flavors, notably the dried fruit notes of the sweet wine.\n- **Pricing:** Ranges from inexpensive versions with less complexity to more complex, premium versions.\n\n### Changes in Legal Designations\n- **Notice:** Due to recent changes in the law, Amontillado, Oloroso, and Palo Cortado can only be labeled as such or blended and labeled as Oloroso dulce. However, historically, any blend of these with others (like sweet/PX) could be called Oloroso dulce.\n\n### Sherries with an Indication of Age\n- **Categories Based on Age:**\n  - **VOS (Vinum Optimum Signatum):** Very Old Sherry, indicating the blend is at least 30 years old.\n  - **VOA (Vinum Optimum Aegnum):** Very Old Rare Sherry, indicating the blend is at least 20 years old.\n- **Regulation:** Compliance testing for each batch to verify the age.\n- **Other Details:** Lesser age categories such as 12 and 15 years can be applied more flexibly as they apply to the whole solera system.\n- **Qualifications for Age Indicator:** Only the wines labeled as Amontillado, Palo Cortado, Oloroso, and PX can qualify for age-indicated status.\n\nThis overview categorizes and details various aspects of Sherry wine, focusing on aging, sweetness profiles, and legal regulations vital for understanding the product and its market positioning."

Indeed the region is so close to Champagne and seems so ideal for making sparkling wine that you'd think the Champenois would want to annex it. There's just one problem. The region in question is in England.\n\nThe English, of course, have always loved bubbles. The country continues to be, as it has been for decades, the leading export market for Champagne. But sometime in the 1990s, the English began to think big. Why merely buy bubbly? Why not try to make it… especially since southeast England—near Sussex, Kent, and of course the White Cliffs of Dover—bears a remarkable resemblance to the Champagne region?\n\nThey've done just that. More than a dozen British companies, including Ridgeview Estate, Nyetimber, Rathfinny, Camel Valley, Hush Heath, and Chapel Down, all make English sparkling wines, and several more ventures are in the works. For their part, numerous Champagne houses have scouted the region in anticipation of future deals.\n\nThey've had a royal welcome. Camilla Parker Bowles, Duchess of Cornwall (and second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales) is the current president of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association.\n\n---\n\n# BLANC DE BLANCS CHAMPAGNE\n\nLiterally “white from whites,” blanc de blancs Champagne is made entirely from chardonnay grapes. This type of Champagne was created in 1921 by Eugène-Aimé Salon, founder of the Champagne house Salon, whose intention was to create a Champagne with maximum finesse, lightness, and elegance. Easy to say, but exceedingly difficult to do, since the winemaker limited to one grape variety has fewer overall wines with which to work.\n\nThe best blanc de blancs are treasured for their lightness and their gymnastic lift on the palate. They, among all Champagnes, are the sopranos, capable of hitting the high notes of flavor and displaying an especially filigreed sense of texture. Blanc de blancs Champagnes are crafted with a meticulous focus on quality, embodying the pinnacle of what this single grape can achieve in the realm of sparkling wines."

The main findings and points can be organized as follows:\n\n- **Context**: The document describes an experience spurred by a New York Times article proclaiming London as the premier cocktail city, prompting the authors, Phil and Dave, to visit London's bars, something they hadn’t done prior to their bar, Death & Co., opening.\n  \n- **Purpose of Trip**: To verify if London truly was the superior cocktail city as claimed, and to draw inspiration or ideas.\n\n- **Activities and Observations**:\n  - Visited around twenty-five bars in London.\n  - Noted that London’s craft cocktail scene was more vibrant than New York's, with a wider use of fresh juice, good ice, and intriguing ingredients.\n  - Observed that London bars adopted much larger menus than what was typically recommended in New York, where experts advised keeping the menu to no more than twelve drinks for quality and consistency.\n\n- **Learnings and Adaptations**:\n  1. **Menu Expansion**: Inspired by the vast selection they encountered in London, they expanded their menu at Death & Co from ten to sixty drinks.\n  2. **Punch Service**: Incorporation of punch service at their bar after observing its popularity in London, particularly at Hawksmoor, a steakhouse known for its cocktail program where punch was served in a communal fashion.\n\n- **Overall Experience**: The trip was fulfilling as it confirmed some of their already held beliefs and practices while also providing new insights that they implemented at their own establishment, enhancing both their service and menu offerings. They ended their recount positively, stating that the locals appreciated their offerings as much as they appreciated learning from the London scene."
