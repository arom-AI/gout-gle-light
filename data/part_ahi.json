    "contenu": "This document contains information about the taste differences in an apple based on which side of the fruit is sampled, as well as advice for selecting apples for use in cocktails. The text is as follows:\n\n---\n\n**Tasting Different Sides of an Apple**\n\n---\n\n**Taste:** The side of an apple that has more blush (a reddish color) will taste richer, sweeter, and more sun-kissed compared to the other side of the apple. The overall juice flavor from the apple lies between these two tastes.\n\n**Image caption:** The blush side of an apple tastes different.\n\n---\n\n**Selecting Apples for Cocktails**\n\n---\n\n**Testing and Selection:** When selecting apples for cocktails, conduct a simple test by buying two different apples from each variety that interests you. Taste them, and use the one that fits your requirements best. It’s recommended to buy more of the apples you like, as they freeze well.\n\n**Sugar and Acid Content in Apples:**\n\n- **Ideal for Cocktails:** Apples that are high in both sugar and acid.\n- **Low sugar apples:** These are usually underripe and lack flavor, making them less ideal.\n- **High-acid apples:** Allows for cocktail preparation without additional acid, enhancing drink flavors.\n- **Low-acid apples:** May need extra additives like citric acid (malic acid, lemon juice) or acidic alcoholic ingredients (vermouth) to improve flavor.\n- **Preference:** Using apples that don’t need much adjustment is recommended, as such apples let you enjoy the pure flavors without distractions.\n\n---\n\nThe document emphasizes practical advice for choosing and utilizing apples based on their taste characteristics, specifically for making better cocktails."

    "contenu": "The content of the document titled \"Apples\" is a reflective essay on the author's relationship and exploration of apples, particularly their varieties, uses, and underappreciation in cocktails. Here's a structured breakdown of the main points in plain text:\n\n### Apples\n\n#### Introduction \n- The author expresses a fondness for apples, citing a background in New York State where apples thrive.\n- Points out that apples are commonly overlooked as a key ingredient in cocktails due to their low concentration when juiced.\n\n#### Misconceptions and Varieties\n- Initially, many thought there were only two types of apples: red and green.\n- There are actually thousands of apple varieties with distinguishable flavors influenced by quince, orange, rose, anise, and wine, varying in their levels of sugar and acid.\n- Some apples are specifically cherished for their performance in particular regions and times.\n\n#### Cultural and Regional Prefences\n- Certain apple varieties were valued for historical or regional reasons rather than their inherent taste.\n  - Example: Arkansas Black apples are noted for their late-season ripening useful in extending the availability of fresh apples in cooking.\n- The author lamented the modern urgency to grow early-ripening kinds since many traditional late season varieties are less needed.\n\n#### In-depth Study and Discovery\n- In 2007, the author and Harold McGee conducted a serious study of apple flavors at the United States' apple collection in Geneva, New York.\n- The collection contains thousands of varieties, preserving genetic diversity akin to \"Noah's ark.\"\n- They tasted hundreds of varieties over two days, discovering unexpected treasures and surprising the keepers of the collection who did not initially expect taste testing.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- The commitment to preserving such a diverse collection of apples underscores the complexity and richness of this fruit, far beyond the common knowledge of everyday consumers."

Mention of a famous book, \"Jamón de Jabugo\" and a notable musician, Leopold Pomès, related to this dish.\n   - **See Also**: Chocolate & Tomato.\n\n2. **Tomate & Anchois: Anchovy & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Anchovies & Tomato. \n\n3. **Tomate & Anis**\n   - **Details**: Adding some spoons of tomato concentrate with a béarnaise sauce called sauce Choron, a variation from a sauce established in 1837 by the chef Alexandre Etienne Choron. The discussion continues with an anecdote about the siege of Paris in 1870.\n   - **Note**: High-quality tomato concentrate is recommended for optimal flavor.\n\n4. **Tomate & Aubergine**\n   - **Discussion**: Both tomatoes and aubergines belong to the same family as belladonna and can be delicate in cooking. Turkish dish preparation (\"imam bayildi\") and Sicilian dishes such as \"pasta alla Norma\" and \"la caponata\" are mentioned.\n\n5. **Tomate & Avocat: Avocado & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Avocado & Tomato.\n   \n6. **Tomate & Basilic: Basil & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Basilic & Tomato.\n   \n7. **Tomate & Boeuf: Beef & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Boeuf & Tomato.\n   \n8. **Tomate & Cacahuète: Peanut & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Peanut & Tomato.\n\n9. **Tomate & Cannelle: Cinnamon & Tomato**\n   - **See Also**: Cinnamon & Tomato.\n\n10. **Tomate & Câpre: Capers & Tomato**\n    - **Details**: Volcanic soil of the Greek island of Santorini is favorable for growing capers with a unique flavor. Some are dried under the sun.\n   \nThis document is a fascinating glimpse into the culinary uses of tomatoes combined with various other ingredients, emphasizing traditional and regional dishes across different cultures, particularly Mediterranean cuisine."

Harvesting botrytized grapes requires precise timing to catch each grape at the ideal stage of rot.\n  \n- **Labor Intensity:** Grapes must often be picked individually, sometimes over multiple weeks in October and November. This labor-intensive process is costly but essential to produce the highest quality sweet wine.\n\n### Winemaking Process\n\n- **Pressing and Fermenting:** Once harvested, the dehydrated grapes are pressed with difficulty due to their condition. The juice is transferred to oak barrels for fermentation, which is lengthy due to high sugar concentrations, typically taking longer compared to dry white wine (two weeks to one month versus up to a year).\n\n- **Fermentation Dynamics:** Yeast converts the sugar in the must into alcohol. In sweet wines like Sauternes and Barsac, fermentation may stop prematurely due to high alcohol levels, leaving residual sugar (10-15%) that contributes to the wine's sweetness.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe document details the precarious nature of cultivating and harvesting grapes affected by botrytis, or noble rot, focusing on the intricacies and labor involved in producing high-quality sweet wines. Château d'Yquem exemplifies a winemaker who manages these challenges with precise and costly measures. The subsequent winemaking process, affected by high sugar levels, is notably complex and governed by unique fermentation behaviors contributing to the distinct sweetness of wines like Sauternes and Barsac."

Here's the breakdown of the main points covered in the document:\n\n- **Probiotics and Immune System:** The document begins by stating that probiotics can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. It specifically mentions that probiotics help stimulate the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and activate macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells.\n\n- **Probiotic Strains and Natural Fermentation:** There is a question raised about whether specific probiotic bacterial strains that naturally occur in fermented foods offer the same health benefits as those added to foods. This shows there's a debate about the efficacy of naturally occurring versus added probiotics.\n\n- **Health Benefits Validation:** Mary Ellen Sanders, identified as a probiotics consultant and the director of the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics, speaks on the importance of distinguishing between products containing live cultures and those that merely claim probiotic properties without solid proof of health benefits in humans.\n\n- **Recommendations for Probiotic Use with Antibiotics:** The document presents a cautious approach to recommending probiotics for patients consuming antibiotics. It notes that while eating yogurt with live cultures might be beneficial, there is weak evidence supporting the strong recommendation of consuming specific probiotic products for reducing antibiotic-associated side effects.\n\n- **Industry Perspective:** It concludes by reflecting on how probiotic products that lack adequate human testing may still have some effect but cannot be strongly recommended, illustrating a general attitude within the probiotics industry.\n\nThis summary emphasizes the cautious and researched approach necessary when discussing the benefits and recommendations of probiotics in medical and health contexts. The information is presented with an implied need for more solid evidence before making strong health claims."

Massive stone castles stand as fortresses atop the highest ridges. The masculine power and glory of medieval Spain is palpable.\n\nOn these high, dry, sunny plains, the vineyards, too, have a severity. Old vines, gnarled as if in agony, protrude from the rough ground. If the ground holds vines in place everywhere else in the world, in Ribera del Duero the opposite seems true. Earth herself clings to the muscular vines.\n\nRibera del Duero is almost exclusively a red wine region, although simple rosés are made for local consumption. The best reds are bold, concentrated, ripe, mouthfilling, structured, and packed with dark flavors reminiscent of roasted coffee, cocoa, peat, and black licorice. Yet the very best of them are also lusciously refined. Indeed, three Ribera del Duero wines—Único (made by Vega-Sicilia), Pingus, and Pesquera—are among the most outstanding red wines anywhere in the world.\n\nThere are more than 250 wine estates in Ribera del Duero. The major grape variety, tinto fino (also known as tinta del país), is another name for the variety tempranillo. But, according to research by the Instituto Tecnológico Agrario de Castilla y León, there are, of course, clonal differences. After centuries of adaptation, the tempranillo clones that exist in Ribera del Duero are quite different from those in Rioja. Thanks to Ribera del Duero’s harsh, dramatic climate, tinto fino’s smaller berries and tougher skins make wines that are often more powerful (but occasionally less polished) than Rioja.\n\n## THE QUICK SIP ON RIBERA DEL DUERO\n\n- **RIBERA DEL DUERO** is the poster image of _conquistador_ Spain, a land of rugged other mesas. All of its top wines are red and based on the grape tinto fino, the name of a group of clones of tempranillo.\n- **THE MOST LEGENDARY** and expensive red wine in Spain, Vega-Sicilia's Unico, is made here.\n- **RIBERA DEL DUERO'S TOP WINES** are concentrated, richly textured, and among the longest lived of all Spanish red wines.\n\nRibera del Duero is named for the river Duero, the third largest river on the Iberian Peninsula. The river crosses the great _meseta_ (high plateau) of north central Spain, ultimately plunging down into Portugal, where it becomes the Douro (linked famously to Port wine) and finally empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn Ribera del Duero, the river forms a 22-mile-wide (35-kilometer) valley with flattopped mountainous on either side. Vineyards, interspersed among fields of grain and sugar beets, are scattered along a 71-mile-long (115-kilometer) strip on the north and south sides of the valley. According to the region’s official _Denominación de Origen_.\n```"

It features other grassy and citrusy orange-scented compounds, adding to the overall flavour.\n- **Vegetable Family**: Cauliflower is part of the Brassicaceae family, sharing volatile compounds with other genetically related species such as broccoli, which contain compounds like dimethyl sulphide, trisulphide, nonanal and erucin. \n- **Nutrient Content**: Cauliflower derives much of its flavour from iberverin, a character impact compound, and is also responsible for the flavour of cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and sauerkraut.\n\n### Section 2: Nomenclature and Versatility\n- **Terminology**: The terms \"brassica\" and \"cruciferous vegetables\" are used interchangeably. \"Cruciferate\" was the original term for the group before modern botanical terminology became established in the early 20th century.\n- **Culinary Uses**: Cauliflower molds to various culinary forms, from raw picks to roasting and frying. The plant consists of various cultivars with varying shapes, sizes, and colors from white to green and purple, which are equally nutritious and rich in antioxidants like polyphenols and glucosinolates.\n\n### Section 3: Cauliflower when boiled vs. roasted\n- **Flavour Reduction When Boiled**: Boiling leads to a loss of flavour and enhanced kitchen odour because the hydrophilic (water-attracting) aroma molecules in cauliflower are leached out into the cooking water.\n- **Enhanced Flavour When Roasted**: Fats used in roasting or sautéing help to trap these aroma molecules during cooking, resulting in enhanced flavours. This principle also applies to asparagus and particularly for vegetables with high concentrations of hydrophilic aroma molecules.\n- **Practical Tip**: To manage cauliflower's natural odour during cooking, it's suggested to add some oil or butter to the cooking medium to trap unpleasant sulphurous compounds.\n\nIn summary, the document provides insights into the composition, culinary uses, and cooking methodologies related to cauliflower, emphasizing the impact of different cooking methods on its flavor and aroma profile."

    "contenu": "### The Structure and Qualities of Meat\n\n#### Production Methods and Meat Quality\nFull-flavored meat comes from animals that have led a full life. However, exercise and age also increase muscle fiber diameter and the cross-linking of connective tissue: so a full life also means tougher meat. In centuries past, most people ate mature, tough, strongly flavored meat, and developed long-cooked recipes to soften it. Today, most of us eat young, tender, mild meat that is at its best quickly cooked; long-cooking often dries it out. This shift in meat quality has resulted from a shift in the way the animals are raised.\n\n#### Rural and Urban Styles of Meat\nThere are two traditional, indeed ancient ways of obtaining meat from animals, and they produce meats of distinctive qualities.\n\n**One method** is to raise animals primarily for their value as living companions—oxen and horses for their work in the fields, laying hens for their eggs, cows and sheep and goats for their milk and for wool—and turn them into meat only when they are no longer productive. In this system, slaughtering animals for meat is the last use of a resource that is more valuable when alive. The meat comes from mature animals, and is therefore well exercised and relatively tough, but flavorful. This method was by far the most common one from prehistoric times until the 19th century.\n\n**The second way** of obtaining meat from animals is to raise the animals exclusively for that purpose. This means feeding the animals well, sparing them unnecessary exercise, and slaughtering them young to obtain tender, mild, fatty flesh. This method also goes back to prehistory, when it was applied to pigs and to the otherwise useless male offspring of hens and dairy animals. With the rise of cities, meat animals were confined and fattened exclusively for the urban elite who could afford such a luxury, an art represented in Egyptian murals and described by Roman writers.\n\nFor many centuries, rural and urban meats coexisted, and inspired the development of two distinct styles of meat preparation: roasting for the tender, fatted meats of the wealthy, and stewing for the tough, lean meats of the peasants.\n\n#### The Rural Style Disappears\nWith the Industrial Revolution, draft animals were slowly replaced by machines. City populations and the middle class grew, and along with them the demand for meat, which encouraged the rise of large-scale specialized meat production. In 1927 the U.S. Department of Agriculture enshrined the identification of quality with urban-style fatness when it based its beef grading system on the amount of “marbling” fat deposited within the muscles.\n\n#### Mass Production Favors Immaturity\nToday nearly all meat comes from animals raised exclusively for that purpose. Mass production methods are dictated by a simple economic imperative: the meat should be produced at minimum cost, which generally means in the shortest possible time. Animals are now confined to minimize the expenditure of feed on unnecessary movement, and they’re slaughtered before they reach adulthood, when the growth of their muscles slows down. Rapid, confined growth favors the production of white muscle fibers, so modern meats are relatively pale. They’re also tender, because the animals get little exercise, because rapid growth means that their connective-tissue collagen is continuously taken apart and remade."

Full of wild strawberry, ripe watermelon, and juniper berry flavors, they are like a cool shower on a hot day. Spanish rosés can be made from a number of different grapes, but most are made from either garnacha or tempranillo. Often they are made by sangrée—sangrado in Spanish—the process of “bleeding” pink juice off a red wine-to-be. With the possible exception of the coastal northwest, they are made all over Spain, although many of the best known come from Rioja and Navarra. Garlicky seafood dishes and paella are especially good partners, but the wine is so delicious, all it really needs is a summer evening.\n\nRioja is not known for its white wines (90 percent of the wine produced is red), although good basic white wines are made. These are simple, crisp, fresh wines, almost always made mainly from the grape variety viura (known as macabeo in other regions of Spain). The New York Times wine reporter and critic Eric Asimov may have captured white Rioja wines best when he called them “pinot grigios with a brain.” Although it is rare now, one can also still occasionally come across the traditional style of white Rioja—viura that has been made in oak then aged in oak for years until it takes on a resiny, honied, waxy, oxidized character. These old-style white Riojas—today made principally by the two firms Marqués de Murrieta and R. López de Heredia—can be spellbinding wines, though they are nothing if not an acquired taste.\n\nIn the past, most of Rioja’s 375 or so bodegas owned no land at all, but instead bought grapes and/or wine from the region’s 17,000 small growers, most of whom owned fewer than 10 acres (4 hectares) of land. Today, while the majority of bodegas still buy some grapes and wine from growers, there is a strong movement toward ownership of vineyards.\n\n### SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCERS OF RIOJA\n\n- Baron de Ley Finca Monasterio\n- Bodegas Artadi\n- Bodegas Breton\n- Bodegas Fernando Remirez de Ganuza\n- Compañía de Vinos Telmo Rodriguez\n- Contino\n- Coto de Imaz\n- CUNÉ\n- Finca Allende\n- Finca Valpiedra\n- La Granja Nuestra Señora de Remelluri\n- La Rioja Alta\n- Marqués de Cáceres\n- Marqués de Riscal\n- Martinez Bujanda\n- Muga\n- R.

He's also a Roman Catholic priest and a lawyer.\n\nDeath & Co is an 85-minute walk from the Holy Trinity Parish on Eighty-Second and Broadway. When I first moved to New York, I'd leave the church on Sunday night (which is a priest's Friday night) and walk downtown to the bar. If there was a wait to be seated, I’d read my book or chat with Frankie, the doorman, about his screenplay in progress. He was always politely amused that I would sit under the awning and wait. Later I found time to come down on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well. Then Death & Co became my home away from home.\n\nI like to begin the evening with a Ti Punch. Each bartender makes it differently and swears his or her variation is the best. Joaquin's is essentially a rum snow cone, and Thomas's doesn't have a hint of ice. After the Ti Punch, I'll have a one-to-one martini, then a Rob Roy. I can’t be in bar where I don’t feel comfortable ordering a martini.\n\nThough you usually go to a bar to turn off your brain, sometimes you want to turn it on. In the latter case, the Death & Co bar staff are always willing to teach their craft, and their depth of experience means that you're always in excellent hands, no matter who's behind the bar. Being a bartender there is a hard job. Those folks could be making more money slinging rum and Cokes anywhere else. Every night they have to explain to someone why the bar doesn’t serve vodka, and they're constantly asked, “What's your favorite drink?”\n\nI regard the work of the priesthood largely as encountering people who feel lost. Everyone eventually wonders about his or her place in the world, and that tends to be when they go to church. I think my task is to show them that we're all at home in this universe and that it’s a good place that’s warm and inviting. That’s hospitality—creating a sense of home for people. It’s not a stretch to say a bartender performs a similar service."
