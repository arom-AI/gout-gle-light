Their purpose is to enhance the flavor of that ingredient—a portion of meat or fish or grain or vegetable—either by deepening and broadening its own intrinsic flavor, or by providing a contrast or complement to it. While the meat or grain or vegetable is always more or less itself, a sauce can be anything the cook wants it to be, and makes the dish a richer, more various, more satisfying composition. Sauces help the cook feed our perpetual hunger for stimulating sensations, for the pleasures of taste and smell, touch and sight. Sauces are distillations of desire.\n\nThe word **sauce** comes from an ancient root word meaning “salt,” which is the original concentrated flavoring, pure mineral crystals from the sea (p. 639). Our primary foods—animal flesh, grains and breads and pastas, starchy vegetables—are pretty bland, and cooks have found or invented a vast range of ingredients with which to make them more flavorful. The simplest are seasonings provided by nature: salt, pungent black pepper and chilies, sour juices of unripe fruits, sweet honey and sugar, distinctively aromatic herbs and spices. More complex are prepared condiments, many of them foods preserved and transformed by fermentation: sour and aromatic vinegar, salty and savory soy sauce and fish sauce, salty and sour pickles, pungent and sour mustard, sweet and sour and fruity ketchup. And then there are **sauces**, the ultimate composed flavorings. The cook conceives and prepares sauces for particular dishes, and can give them any flavor. They always include seasonings, sometimes condiments, and sometimes artfully intensified flavors of the primary foods themselves, or of other foods, or of the cooking process.\n\nIn addition to their heightened flavor, sauces give tactile pleasure by the way they move in the mouth. Cooks construct sauces to have a consistency somewhere between the resistant solidity of animal or plant tissues and the elusive thinness of water. This is the consistency of luscious ripe fruit that melts in the mouth and seems to feed us willingly, and of the fats that give a persistent, moist fullness to animal flesh and to cream and butter. The fluidity of a sauce allows it to coat the solid food evenly and lend it a pleasing moistness, while the substantial, lingering quality helps the sauce cling to the food and to our tongue and palate as well, prolonging the experience of its flavor and providing a sensation of richness.\n\nA last pleasure that a sauce can provide is an attractive appearance. Many sauces are nondescript, but others have the vibrant color of their parent fruit or vegetable, or the depth of tone that comes with roasting and long cooking. Some have an attractive sheen, and some are intriguingly transparent. The visual beauty of a sauce is a sign of the care with which it was made, a suggestion of intensity and clarity of flavor and of presence on the tongue: an anticipation of pleasures to come.\n\nThere are several basic ways of making sauces. Many of them involve disrupting organized plant and animal tissues and freeing the juices that carry their flavor. Once extracted from their source, the juices can be combined with other flavorful materials, and then often benefit from thickening to help them linger on the food and in the mouth. The cook thickens juices by filling them with a variety of large molecules or particles that obstruct the flow of the water molecules. Most of this chapter deals with different thickening methods and their applications.\n\nSauces are closely related to two other basic preparations. **Soups** are also liquid foods of various consistencies, and may differ from sauces only in being somewhat less concentrated in flavor, so that they can be eaten as a food in themselves, not an accent. And **jellies** are thickened liquids with enough gelatin in them to set at room temperature, thus becoming a temporarily solid food that melts into a sauce in the mouth.\n```"

The essence of nouvelle cuisine is moving away from heavy, white sauces, epitomized by Michel Guérard's statement that \"the great sauces of France must be thrown away.\"\n\n### Post-Nouvelle: Diverse and Innovative Sauces\nIn the 21st century, traditional brown and white sauces became scarce, leading to a resurgence in their appreciation and a move towards more diverse and innovative sauces. Modern chefs and home cooks now often rely on simpler, less laborious methods producing a broader spectrum of sauces from vegetables, nuts, spices, and other contrasting ingredients. These sauces are typically thinner and might include novel combinations such as soy- or fish-based sauces. Additionally, new culinary tools and materials like liquid nitrogen and pulversizers are being used to create new forms of food suspensions, foams, and jellies.\n\n#### Summary\nThe evolution from nouvelle to post-nouvelle cuisine reflects a broader trend towards simplicity, variety, and innovation in sauce-making. This includes moving away from traditional thick sauces to exploring a wide array of textures and flavors suited to contemporary tastes.\n```"

Therefore, the length of time that the wine stays on its skins once fermentation is complete depends on the style of wine being made. Some winemakers have found that very long periods of post-fermentation maceration can help to create a smoother tannin structure.\n\n## Press Wine\nWhen the maceration has finished, the free run wine is drawn off the skins and the remaining mass is pressed, creating press wine. At the start of pressing, this press wine may be similar in composition to the free run wine, but as pressing continues the wine becomes deeper in colour and higher in tannin. Some winemakers will separate the wine from different stages in the pressing (these are called press fractions). Later press fractions may then be used to adjust colour and tannin in the final blend.\n\n## Whole Bunch Fermentations\nMost wine is made by crushing the fruit. However, some winemakers include whole bunches of uncrushed grapes in the fermentation. In some cases the uncrushed fruit may make up the entire vat; in others, only a small percentage may be used to make a more subtle contribution to the flavour of the wine. Importantly, if whole bunches are used, the winemaker must ensure that the grape stems are fully ripe; if not, the tannins in the stems can give the finished wine an undesirable bitter taste.\n\nThe objective of this technique is to create an oxygen-free environment for the uncrushed fruit. This lack of oxygen has a number of outcomes. First, the berries create some alcohol in their cells, without the involvement of any yeast. This is referred to as intracellular fermentation. Second, and more importantly, a range of distinctive fruity aromas is created inside the berry, which gives wines made in this way unique qualities.\n\nThere are three forms of whole bunch fermentation:\n\n### Carbonic maceration\nThis involves placing only whole, uncrushed bunches into vats that are then filled with CO2 to remove all the oxygen. This causes the intracellular fermentation to start. Once the level of alcohol in the grape reaches 2 per cent the grape skins start to split and the grapes release their juice. The grapes are generally pressed at this stage to separate the juice from the skins. Yeast then complete the fermentation off the skins. Importantly, this method extracts colour from the grapes, but little tannin, and the resulting wines are soft and full of fruit, with distinctive notes of kirsch, banana, and bubble gum and cinnamon-like spice.\n\n### Semi-carbonic maceration\nThis is a similar but slightly different technique that does not involve filling the vats with CO2. The vats are filled with whole bunches. The grapes at the bottom of the vat are crushed under the weight of the grapes above and some juice is released. Ambient yeast start to ferment the juice. This fermentation produces CO2, which fills the vat and the remaining intact berries undergo carbonic maceration. As the intact grapes begin to split and release their juice the grapes are pressed and yeast complete the fermentation off the skins.\n\nSome notable premium Pinot Noirs are made using this technique although the alcoholic fermentation continuously on the skins. In this instance the grapes will be progressive broken up using punching down over the course of the first few days. An ever-decreasing amount of carbonic maceration takes place until all the grapes are broken. The alcoholic fermentation will then continue on the skins and may be followed by a post-fermentation maceration. This approach can result in a better integration of aromas from intracellular fermentation with aromas from the grape variety. It results in wines with a fresher fruit character.\n\n### Whole bunches with crushed fruit\nA further variation is to mix whole bunches with crushed grapes in the fermenting vessel at the start of the fermentation. Although the whole bunches in the vat are not blanketed in CO2, they are largely submerged by the crushed grapes and kept away from oxygen, therefore intracellular fermentation takes place. The whole bunches are progressively crushed during the fermentation as the cap is regularly punched down. More 'carbonic' characteris can be achieved by raising the percentage of whole bunches that are present at the start of the fermentation. This technique is thought to give the wine a silkier texture and a brighter, fresher fruit character.\n\n## Maturation Options\nThe option of whether or not to use oak is perhaps the most important decision when it comes to pre-bottling maturation in red wine production. Virtually all red wines undergo MLF and their more robust flavours and textures, compared with most white wines, mean they generally benefit less from extended time on their lees. Oak is widely used in red winemaking. As with white wines, this may be in the form of oak barrels, or oak staves or chips that have been added to an inert vessel. The trend for winemakers to mature their premium red wines entirely in small new oak barrels is declining in most wine regions. Now, many wine producers are aiming for greater subtlety and integration, using oak vessels of different ages and larger sizes. However, a winemaker’s best wines will still often be aged for longer periods in oak regardless of the size of the vessels.\n```"

Here is a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### Fermentation for Beverages\nThis section discusses the method to make beverages suitable for those avoiding alcohol, including children. It details the process as:\n- **Fermentation Duration:** Ferment for as short a time as possible to minimize alcohol production.\n- **Probiotic Involvement:** Utilize probiotic bacteria which allows carbonation and limits acidity.\n- **Alcohol Content:** Aims to keep alcohol accumulation below the legal limit for non-alcoholic beverages (0.5 percent), which is often so low that it is usually imperceptible.\n- **Commonality of Alcohol in Foods:** Notes that many common foods and beverages (e.g., bread, orange juice) contain small traces of alcohol.\n\n### Carbonation\nDescribes personal and general perceptions about carbonation in beverages and the process of natural carbonation through fermentation.\n- **Preference for Carbonation:** Author expresses a personal preference for carbonated beverages, shaped by cultural and individual experiences.\n- **Process of Natural Carbonation:**\n  - **Timing of Sealing:** Advises to wait until fermentation shows visible signs of activity (vigorous bubbling) before bottling.\n  - **Type of Bottles:** Suggests using bottles that can withstand some pressure, such as bail-top bottles, beer bottles with crimp caps, or soda bottles.\n  - **Duration of Post-bottling Fermentation:** Indicates that the time for post-bottling fermentation can vary (typically measured in hours) depending on temperature and the level of activity.\n  - **Final Step:** Recommends refrigerating the bottled beverage before enjoying it. \n\nThis text provides both practical advice for those looking to produce low-alcohol fermented beverages and also reflects on the author's nostalgic connection to carbonated drinks."

    "contenu": "Sure, here is the structured content based extracted from the image:\n\n### CHAPTER 3\n\n#### Basic Concepts and Equipment\n\n**Broadly speaking, fermentation** is the transformative action of microorganisms. Some definitions emphasize the role of enzymes, as it is through the action of enzymes they produce that cells digest and thereby transform nutrients. Indeed, certain ferments, such as amazaké (see Amazaké in chapter 10) or rice beers (see Asian Rice Brews in chapter 9), use molds as sources of enzymes, although the molds themselves do not grow. Biologists use a more specific meaning defining fermentation as anaerobic metabolism, the production of energy without oxygen. Most ferments—alcohol fermented by yeasts, and foods fermented by lactic acid bacteria—meet the biologists’ more restrictive definition. But foods created by oxygen-dependent bacteria and fungi, such as vinegar, tempeh, and molded cheeses, are also widely understood to be products of fermentation.\n\n#### Substrates and Microbial Communities\n\nThe food we are fermenting is known in the literature as the **substrate**. It is both food for our microbial friends, and the medium upon which they grow. On any raw food that we wish to ferment, many different types of organisms are present. Microorganisms are not only inherently there, but are also commonly used to be products of fermentation."

Dry wines have no residual sugar, and sweet wines are made either by stopping fermentation early or adding sweet grape juice post-fermentation.\n\n### Malolactic Fermentation\n- **Purpose:** Sometimes induced to allow or enhance a second bacterial fermentation to consume the wine’s malic acid and convert it into lactic acid, reducing tartness and enhancing aroma.\n- **Bacteria Involved:** *Leuconostoc oenos*.\n- **Potential Contributions:** Adds buttery diacetyl, which contributes a distinctive aroma similar to cultured butter. \n- **Prevention of Further Development:** Some winemakers work to prevent a spontaneous malolactic fermentation to maintain the original wine’s sharpness and flavor.\n\n### Maturation \n- **Process:** After fermentation, the new wine is drained out of the fermentation tanks.\n\n### Racking and Fining\n- **Purpose:** Solid particles and yeasts are cleared from the wine through racking. Fining involves using substances that bind to undesired particles, which then settle and can be removed.\n- **Temperature Specifics:** Temperatures vary with wine type. Less than 60°F/16°C for reds and around 32°F/0°C for whites.\n- **Materials Used for Fining:** Include gelatin, egg white, bentonite clay, and synthetic materials.\n- **Outcome:** Enhances the wine's flavor and body by removing foreign particles and contributing to clarity.\n\n### Bretanomyces, the Controversial Barrel Yeast\n- **Characteristics in Wine:** Classic reds from Burgundy and Bordeaux may have aroma notes suggestive of a barnyard due to *Brettanomyces* yeast.\n- **Perception:** Some consider the \"brett\" aroma a defect due to potential contamination, while others view it as adding complexity to the wine’s flavors.\n\n--- \n\nThis content encapsulates various processes and details pertaining to the production and enhancement of wine, explaining both biochemical changes and methodologies used to influence the final product’s flavor and quality."

Here’s the structured content based on the key points covered:\n\n### Processing of Salt\n- Salt can be derived from rock salt by adding sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide to the brine, which removes magnesium and calcium.\n- Salt from seawater is also purified through a gradual crystallization process in open-air pans.\n- The crystallization of sodium chloride from the brine dictates the shapes of salt crystals that form.\n- Any magnesium salts, which are insoluble, settle and are separated from sodium chloride crystals.\n\n### Crystal Shapes of Salt\n- **Granulated Salt:** Produced either rapidly in closed tanks or slowly in open containers. Granular salt is susceptible to moisture absorption and clumping; thus, additives like aluminum and calcium silicate are often included.\n- **Flake Salt:** Formed when partial crystallization occurs on the surface, leading to pyramid-shaped flakes. These are used for baking and as a finishing salt due to their delicate structure.\n\n### Types of Salt\n- **Granulated Table Salt:** Typically dense and may include additives to prevent moisture absorption and caking. It is designed to dissolve slowly.\n- **Iodized Salt:** Fortified with potassium iodide to prevent iodine deficiency. Iodized salt reacts with moisture to develop a distinctive taste.\n- **Flake Salt:** Created through surface evaporation; the flakes are large and irregular, ideal for finishing touches on dishes.\n\n### General Information on Salt Production\n- About 50% of salt worldwide is derived from the sea, and in the U.S., 95% comes from salt mines.\n- Edible salts generally have a sodium chloride content ranging from 98 to 99.7%.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the document’s insights into different salt forms and their production and use."

    "contenu": "**HOW SHERRY IS MADE**\n\nBefore diving into the specific winemaking processes of Sherry, it's crucial to note that Sherry comprises several distinctive styles, making it highly individual. The spectrum of Sherry styles includes:\n- **Manzanillas and finos**: Noted for their tangy, crisp, green earthiness.\n- **Amontillados, palo cortados, and olorosos**: Known for their lusty, roasted, nutty flavors.\n- **Creams**: Characterized by sweet, lush toffee, and fig flavors.\n\nNone of these types entirely capture what might be thought of as a typical array of white or red wine flavors. Sherry's flavor and aroma complexity results from a unique aging and blending process within a system of old barrels called a solera.\n\n**HOW THE SOLERA WORKS**\n\nThe solera system is foundational to Sherry production, where each type of Sherry maintains its solera— a network of barrels that undergo a series of processes:\n1. **Grape Harvesting**: Grapes are picked when slightly underripe, generally in August, with potential alcohol content around 12% but not overripe.\n   \n2. **Juice Fermentation**: The crushed grapes are fermented in stainless-steel tanks, akin to other white wines. Post fermentation, the wine is fortified with grape spirits, varying lightly for styles like fino and more for styles like oloroso.\n\n3. **Initial Aging**: Post-fermentation, the wine is aged in barrels for six months to a year, a phase critical for developing initial wine characteristics. \n\n4. **Entry into Solera**: The matured wine then enters the solera system where it progressively blends and ages. It begins in barrels termed botas, palletized in layers up to five rows high—potentially more, depending on the solera's size, but usually around four or five.\n\n5. **Flow of Wine in Solera**: \n   - The oldest wine rests in the bottom barrel layer. Here, small amounts (saca) are occasionally drawn and bottled.\n   - When wine is drawn from a bottom barrel (also referred to as criadera #1 or suelo), it is refilled with an equal quantity from the barrel directly above it.\n   - This process continues upwards such that each barrel is replenished with wine from the one above until the topmost barrel, which receives the newest batch of wine.\n\nThis dynamic method of fractional blending ensures the consistent style and quality of Sherry as it ages, matures, and gradually prepares for distribution. The complexity and craft of the solera system underscore Sherry's unique place in the wine world, providing an endless variety of nuanced flavors and styles."

Here is the structured content summarized:\n\n---\n\n### Descriptions of Cabernet Franc Wines\n- **Flavor profile:** The off-dry wines are harder to find, great with food, and range from raspberry to red cherry flavors, slightly tart Asian or Latin fare enhances the wine's flavors.\n\n### Pairing Pointers\n\n#### Cabernet Franc goes well with:\n- **Green herbs and herbal-scented recipes:** Examples include veal saltimbocca, rosemary-marinated pork, or dishes with sage and prosciutto.\n- **Cooked tuna:** It pairs well with food having a texture similar to seared tuna, especially dishes that include sautéed spinach.\n- **Goat cheese:** Dishes with goat cheese, greens, and possibly toasted walnuts or dishes like stuffed phylo with goat cheese and spinach.\n- **Mexican food:** Enchiladas with a sauce, particularly enjoying the enchiladas suizas with green chile sauce.\n- **Chocolate:** Works well with sweet desserts such as chocolaty ones enhanced with red berries or a chicken mole.\n\n#### Cabernet Franc isn't good:\n- **Wrong wine selection:** An example given is picking a coconut-chocolate macaroon type of wine when the dish calls for a green, leafy French wine.\n- **Rich shellfish dishes:** Flavors between proteins in most shellfish dishes and Cabernet Franc usually clash, especially with green vegetables or bell peppers included.\n\n### Summary\nCabernet Franc can be a versatile wine pairing for a variety of dishes, particularly those that include herbal, cheesy, or modestly spiced profiles. However, choosing the right type of Cabernet Franc is crucial, especially avoiding those that mimic other wine styles poorly or pairing it with rich shellfish dishes."

    "contenu": "### SUGARS, CHOCOLATE, AND CONFECTIONERY\n\n**Chewy Jelly and Paste Candies; Marzipan**\n- **Chewy Jelly and Paste Candies:** Different types include those made by incorporating a sugary syrup into a solution of starch, gelatin, pectin, or plant gums, and then allowing the mixture to solidify into a dense, chewy mass. In Japan and Asia, sweets often use agar (a seaweed extract) which is effective in unusually small amounts (as little as 0.1% of the mixture).\n  \n- **Marzipan:** A paste of sugar and almonds, historically significant in the Middle East and Mediterranean. It is appreciated as a sculptural material, colored to resemble fruits and vegetables, among other shapes. Made by finely grinding almonds and sugar with nut proteins and carbohydrates.\n\n**Turkish Delight**\n- **Turkish Delight (lokum rahat)**: A revered kind of candy in the Middle East and the Balkans, known for being based on starch and flavored with essence of rose, giving it a translucent and slightly velvety texture.\n\n**Licorice**\n- **Licorice:** Commonly created from wheat flour and molasses (30% and 60% respectively), licorice extract making up about 5%; often flavored with anise and paired with ammonia, an aroma traditionally found in overripe cheeses.\n\n**Jelly Beans and Gummy Candies**\n- These popular candies are generally made from a mix of sucrose and corn syrup combined with gelatin and pectin, turning more elastic and crumbly over time they also produce a complex interaction when eaten, providing varying textures and tastes. Generally, they retain about 15% water content after preparation.\n\n**Fizzy and Crackling Candies**\n- Developed in the 19th century, these candies involve embedding a baking powder-like mixture in a very low-moisture sugar syrup. They release carbon dioxide when mixed with acidic components in the mouth, adding a tartness or provoking a crackle effect. Notably, Pop or Space Rocks represent a 20th-century advancement, designed to burst and crackle dramatically in the mouth due to trapped gasified candies formed under pressure."
