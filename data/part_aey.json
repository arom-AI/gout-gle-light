It indicates that although food is preserved and some of its composition changes via fermentation, this process makes certain nutrients easier to break down and assimilate. For instance:\n- Minerals become more bioavailable.\n- Difficult-to-digest compounds are broken down.\n- In soy ferments, fungi and bacteria break down proteins into amino acids.\n- LAB (lactic acid bacteria) in milk convert lactose into lactic acid.\n- Meat and fish become tender as proteins are enzymatically digested.\n\n**Section Title: Nutritional Enhancement**\n\n**Content:**\nIt discusses how the fermentation process can lead to an increase in the levels of B vitamins including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), and niacin (B3) compared to the raw ingredients before fermentation. Moreover, it addresses a controversy over the content of Vitamin B12 in fermented plant sources, stating that foods like tempeh which were previously thought to contain high levels of active B12, have been found to actually have inactive analogues of B12."

Nevertheless, it is a grape to be reckoned with. It’s one of France’s most prolific producers (ranked as high as fourth in the late 1970s). With the focus on sexier, more-complex grapes with higher pedigrees, however, Cinsaut has fallen out of favor. It is still used as a blending grape in southern France and is an important component in one of the world’s greatest rosés, from Tavel in the southern Rhône Valley. In fact, this red grape is almost always at its best as a rosé. But it’s worth looking at all of the styles and interpretations of the variety before our recipe leads us to one of these great pink wines.\n\n#### Alternative Names\nBlue Imperial, Bourdales, Cinq-sao, Cinsault, Hermitage (South Africa), Oeillade (Australia), Ottavianello (Italy), Picardin, Prunella, Salerne (France)\n\n#### Styles\nMedium- to full-bodied dry rosé; medium- to full-bodied dry red\n\n#### Sometimes Blended With\nOther grapes from the classic Châteauneuf-du-Pape blend, including Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah, Counoise, Vaccarese, and Clairette; grapes from the Cabernet family (France)\n\n#### Flavor Lexicon\n- **Red**\n  - Fruit: Blueberry, plum, prune\n  - Wood: Cinnamon, toasted almond\n  - Earth: Farmyard\n  - Other: Meat, white pepper\n\n- **Rosé**\n  - Fruit: Raspberry, sour cherry, strawberry, watermelon \n  - Floral: Tea leaf\n  - Earth: Dust\n  - Other: Pink peppercorn\n\n#### Similar Sips\nXinomavro, lighter Pinotage, lighter Grenache-driven Rhône and red or rosé blends"

He explains that the ability to manipulate these elements can make any dish exciting. Carmellini also stresses the importance of contextualizing the seasoning based on the dish’s origin, citing that one wouldn't use rice wine vinegar in a French bouillabaisse nor would one thicken an Indian curry with strawberries. He believes in tailoring seasoning to enhance dishes like adding vinegar or lemon if too fatty or using lime zest and juice in a Thai-style coconut curry to cut the richness.\n\n---\n\n**Sharon Hage of York Street in Dallas**\n\nSharon Hage describes her method of building flavors in a dish using a structured approach she calls \"the four seasons.\" Her process begins with dry ingredients, with salt being the first addition. Following salt, she adds heat components like red pepper flakes or horseradish. Her next layer involves the addition of acidic components such as lemon juice, vinegar, or verjus. Hage emphasizes the sequence and marriage of heat and fruit along with the importance of sumac as an acidic component in her dishes.\n\n---\n\nThis document effectively highlights different philosophies and practical tips from experienced chefs on how to create a balanced and exciting culinary experience."

But Jumilla (pronounced who-ME-ah), south of Madrid and 50 miles (80 kilometers) inland from the Mediterranean coast, is a high-altitude, arid valley flanked by the southern towns Alicante, Albacete, and Murcia. Although they are scorchingly hot during the day, the vineyards benefit from cool nights, thanks to their location some 1,000 to 3,000 feet (300 to 900 meters) above sea level.\n\nThe main grape here is the red variety monastrell, a late-ripening variety that needs considerable heat. While monastrell is indigenous to Spain, it was brought to southern France, Australia, and California more than a century ago and rechristened mourvèdre or mataró. (French mourvèdre continues to be better known than Spanish monastrell.) The wines produced from it are usually rustic, easy-drinking, fruity, ripe, and lively, although occasionally you find a very serious, complex example that can be stunning. They are widely exported—often at bargain prices. Interestingly, in many of Jumilla’s vineyards, these monastrell vines remain ungrafted (that is, on their own roots), phylloxera having never penetrated the arid soils here. Small amounts of syrah, tempranillo, merlot, and cabernet sauvignon are also grown—often for the purpose of blending with monastrell."

THE SLOVENIANS DRINK AN AVERAGE OF 11 GALLONS (43 LITERS) OF WINE PER PERSON PER YEAR.**\n\nWhile not as well known as its neighbors—Austria, Hungary, Croatia, and the Italian province of Friuli-Venezia Giulia—Slovenia has much in common with all of them, including similarities of climate, geography, and history and, importantly, the ability to produce phenomenal wines. This small country (half the size of Switzerland) currently ranks twenty-seventh in wine production volume worldwide, yet it’s on track to become one of those old wine regions that emerges brilliantly new again.\n\nLike many former Communist countries in Central Europe, Slovenia suffered under the political upheaval of the twentieth century. The country’s fine wine industry—once centered around carefully cultivated vineyards and prestigious, historic wineries—was dismantled and neglected until little was left except cooperatives that produced cheap, low-quality wine in bulk. But like Hungary, Croatia, and the Republic of Georgia, Slovenia emerged from Communist rule with a fierce rededication to making the renowned wines of its past.\n\n![Northern Slovenian villages border Austria and the Alps. The country, at the same latitude as Piedmont, has a mixture of climates—from an alpine climate in the north to a more Mediterranean climate in the south near Slovenia’s border with Italy.](image-url)\n\nThe first accounts of winemaking in Slovenia date from 500 B.C. to 400 B.C., when Celtic and Illyrian tribes here began growing grapes and making wine. From the fall of the Roman Empire, around A.D. 600, until the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1918), Slovenian vineyards were mainly cultivated by monks and, as was true in Burgundy, much innovation occurred. \n\n---"

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n---\n\n**The richer oak-aged styles, fuller in flavor and texture, are better treated like a mildly oaked Chardonnay. Pairing with nuts accentuates the light oxidation that occurs with bottle aging. Crostini, with different toppings, are also lovely with these wines.**\n- If you come across a Verdejo made in a sherry style, treat it like sherry and pair it with the kinds of things you’d serve with dry sherry: olives, nuts, semi-hard cheeses, seafood, and brothy soups.\n\n### PAIRING POINTERS\n\n**Verdejo goes well with:**\n- Vegetables, especially green-vegetable soups. Verdejo can pair with some bitter greens too difficult for other wines to handle, such as watercress, sorrel, and spinach. Minestrone, purées, and many bisques are also good matches.\n- Almost anything emphasizing or enhanced with fresh herbs, such as a Greek salad, chicken breasts grilled with or over rosemary or lemon thyme, or a dish served with salsa verde, herb pesto—or one of my favorites, citrus-spiked guacamole.\n- Sharp and tangy ingredients. Verdejo is defined by its bright and vibrant structure. Vinaigrette is often the enemy of wine, but with Verdejo, a vinaigrette-dressed salad, or grilled fish, meat, or poultry drizzled with a vinaigrette (especially served at room temperature), can be a solid match.\n- Pure and clean ingredients. Try a Verdejo with a tuna poke or a crawfish boil, simply grilled swordfish with garlic-caper butter, or an asparagus salad with toasted walnuts and goat cheese.\n- Dishes that are spicy and hot. Verdejo’s bright acidity and low alcohol help cleanse and refresh your palate. And if you can find a wine with ripe fruit and a hint of sweetness, all the better.\n\n**Verdejo isn’t good:**\n- On its own (sometimes). Some people find it too intense for sipping before a meal. I prefer to drink it with food.\n- With sweet dishes. With the exception of a few Verdejo wines that are perceptibly off-dry, most examples don’t pair well with the likes of Chinese orange chicken or honey-glazed ham.\n- With rich red meats. Although preparing the meat with spices or herbs can work by playing down the meatiness (a lamb brochette with an herbal marinade is quite good), prime rib or a cowboy steak is not the best match.\n- With salty dishes. Too much salt kills the fruit and leaves the wine tasting quite tart. And blue cheese is a no-no.\n\n---"

Below is the structured content extract:\n\n---\n**Winemaking Styles in Northern Rhône**\n- **Modern Direction**: Winemaking styles in the northern Rhône are evolving with modern techniques.\n- **Traditional Methods**: Key among traditional methods is including stems with grapes during fermentation, which adds aroma and flavor with notes of sandalwood, spice, and a briary character; this also increases tannin in the wines.\n\n**Production and Cost**\n- The production of wines in Northern Rhône is limited, leading to more expensive wines, especially top Côte-Rôties and Hermitages, due to the difficult vineyard terrains.\n\n**Côte-Rôtie Wines**\n- Described as dramatic with incisive, earthy, and gamy flavors.\n- All wines from this region are based on the syrah grape, occasionally blended with a small amount of white grapes.\n- **Vineyard Locations**: Some of the best vineyards have slopes with grades of up to 60 degrees, facing south.\n\n**Côte-Rôtie Vineyard Characteristics**\n- **Côte Brune and Côte Blonde**: Two famous slopes in Côte-Rôtie, known for producing distinct types of wines; Côte Brunes are tannic and powerful while Côte Blondes are more elegant and racy.\n- **Top Vineyards**: La Mouline, La Landonne, La Chatillonne, La Garde, La Chevalière, and La Turque. These vineyards may produce wines named after the specific vineyard, resulting in expensive and high-quality products.\n\n**Wine Blending and Vinification**\n- Producers often blend grapes from various vineyard sites to enhance complexity.\n- Exceptional vineyards may be vinified separately, and wines named after specific vineyards tend to be more expensive and exquisite.\n\n**Regulatory Notes**\n- Côte-Rôtie, along with Hermitage, can legally blend a small quantity of white grapes in predominantly syrah red wines, a practice mainly for practical reasons in vineyard management.\n\nThis summary captures the essence and focal points discussed in the document regarding Côte-Rôtie and its winemaking approach in the Rhône region."

    "contenu": "The structured content of the document consists of two main sections: an article and a table. Below, I will provide the structured text representation of the article and the Markdown format for the table.\n\n### Article: The Importance of Aroma\n\n#### Flavour associations: Learning to like\n\nOur reasons for liking or disliking certain foods are rarely inherent – most of the time, our preferences are shaped by a series of experiences. It is less a matter of being 'born that way' than a matter of psychology.\n\nWhile studying the digestive system in dogs, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) noticed that after a while, his dogs started salivating before even receiving any food. He discovered that any stimulus that was associated with food (in his classic experiment, it was the sound of a buzzer or a metronome) would eventually lead to a salivary response on its own. Similar learning processes also govern what humans learn to like and dislike. The principles of classical conditioning help explain how we can grow to like flavours that we may initially dislike. A positive consequence of a food ingested is the reward that is needed to establish an association. This reward can come in the form of energy (from sugars, for example) or from physiological effects, like those of alcohol or caffeine. Both these substances taste bitter, but their pleasurable consequences can overcome our inborn dislike of bitterness, even to the extent that we learn to like bitter aromas. Less harmful rewards, such as the refreshing sensation of cool water in the mouth, can also work. When such a bodily reward is coupled to a specific flavor, this flavour will over repeated exposure start to become liked.\n\nWe can use aroma to link a new (neutral or disliked) flavour through the association with a flavour that we already like. This type of transfer of liking is known as evaluative conditioning, or flavour-flavour learning in the context of food. Repeatedly pairing a new flavour with a flavour we know and like lets us learn to like a new flavour too. Sweetness is a universally liked taste, which makes it a good candidate when it comes to learning to like flavours. Adding sugar to bitter coffee or sour plain yogurt makes them instantly more palatable. Over time we acquire a taste for the unsweetened version – the association with sweetness has done its trick.\n\nAssociating a flavour you like with a new flavour you do not like will lead to you liking the initially unliked flavour more. In the context of Foodpairing, this is a very interesting finding. If one flavour in a new combination is liked, any other flavour in that pairing will over time become liked too.\n\n### Table: Flavour–flavour learning: Combining disliked and liked ingredients in order to learn to like disliked flavours\n\n```markdown\n| PERSON | Dislikes               | Likes                                                                              |\n|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PERSON 1| broccoli, fennel, black salsify | carrot, blue cheese, coconut, mango, beetroot                                      |\n|         |                        | blue cheese with mango and fennel salad                                            |\n| PERSON 2| Brussels sprouts, asparagus | walnut, leek, walnut                                                             |\n|         |                        | roasted Brussels sprouts with pomegranate, walnut and roast chicken               |\n|         |                        | pomegranate tarragon endive                                                        |\n```\n\nEach row in the table illustrates how combining disliked and liked ingredients can help individuals develop a liking for the previously disliked flavors."

    "contenu": "# Liguria\n\nKnown as the Italian Riviera, Liguria is the crescent-shaped region arcing from the French border down to Tuscany. Virtually in the center is Genoa, Liguria’s capital and one of Italy’s most historic and busiest ports. The steeply terraced vineyards, perched on the ridges of the Apennine mountain range, descend right to the Ligurian Sea. (Astoundingly, some of the vineyards can be reached only by boat.) So little land is available for these mountain-clinging vineyards that the production of Ligurian wine is necessarily minuscule. And the steep incline means that vineyards can be farmed only slowly and painstakingly by hand. Traditionally, much of the wine here was little more than a basic commodity, meant for washing down the local cuisine. (Pesto and olive oil, both Ligurian specialties, are especially famous.) But today, a new commitment to quality has taken hold.\n\n## Wine Regions and Types\n\n### Cinqueterre\n- **Location:** Genoa’s east\n- **Type:** Wine known as Cinqueterre (translates as \"five lands\")\n- **Characteristics:**\n  - Made near five fishing villages.\n  - Neutral-tasting but nonetheless popular white wine is made from bosco and albarola varieties, plus vermentino.\n  - Best producers use as much vermentino as possible for better character.\n  - **Cinqueterre Sciacchetrà** is a sweet version made from grapes left in the sun to dry and concentrate, though rarely found in export markets.\n\n### Riviera Ligure di Ponente\n- **Local specialty:** White grape pigato (means “spotted”)\n- **Characteristics:**\n  - Pigato can be minerally, bold, and flavorsome, making it excellent with pesto.\n\n### West of Genoa area\n- **Wines made:**\n  - **Ormeasco:** Fruity, quaffing reds.\n  - **Vermentino:** Dry, floral, somewhat resinous white wine, originating in the fourteenth century from Spain or Corsica.\n  - **Dolceacqua (also Rossese di Dolceacqua):**\n    - Made from Rossese, the best red grape of the region.\n    - Noted favorite of Napoléon; used with rabbit braised with olives.\n\nEach of these wines reflects the unique geographical and agricultural properties of Liguria, transforming limited land resources into renowned local specialties. These wines highlight the adaptability of viticulture in challenging terrains and play a crucial role in both local cuisine and the broader wine market."

Attempting to save such a person is not advised as exposure can be instantly harmful.\n\n3. **Specific Risks with Liquid Nitrogen**:\n   - **Transportation**: Liquid nitrogen should not be transported in elevators or in cars due to the risk of spills and the inability to escape in case of an accident.\n   - **Storage**: Liquid nitrogen must be stored in open containers or in a special vessel called a dewar to control the pressure build-up inside a sealed environment, which can be very dangerous.\n\n4. **Applications of Liquid Nitrogen**:\n   - The document describes how liquid nitrogen can instantly freeze herbs, fruits, drinks, etc., without contamination. Although it has these advantageous applications, there are concerns regarding overchilling drinks and the potential hazards it poses, like damaging taste buds permanently from excessively chilled items.\n\n5. **Economics and Supply**:\n   - Details about the cost and regular supply of liquid nitrogen are provided, specifically referencing Booker and Dax, where they have a 160-liter dewar refilled weekly. Comparative costs between different sizes of dewars are also mentioned, showing economic considerations for different volumes.\n\nIn summary, the document cautions the reader about the hazardous properties and necessary safety protocols for handling liquid nitrogen, while also discussing its unique uses and operational logistics in supply and cost management."

Overnight, we’ll marinate peeled beets in Barolo vinegar, shallots, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Using Russian and Polish cooking principles, marinating the beets ensures that the vinegar is able to penetrate them so that they are sure to be tangy.\"\n\n2. **Katsuya Fukushima, Minibar (Washington, DC)**\n   - Quote: \"I wanted to take beets that are associated with winter and make them into something summery, so I used them for a ceviche. We roasted and pureed them with lime and froze them into a sorbet. We served the beet sorbet flat in a bowl so it looked like soup. From there, we layered thinly sliced raw bay scallops with segments of lime, cilantro, and red onion oil. The dish is very fresh tasting. The other key to this dish was that we had on all the flavors of ceviche but did not marinate the scallops in the acid, which makes them rubbery. The scallops treated this way are more delicate, like sushi.\"\n\n### Descriptions of Dishes\n\n- **Roasted Beet Tartare with Chianti Vinegar and Ricotta Salata**\n  - Chef: Mario Batali, Babbo (New York City)\n\n- **Roasted Beet Salad: Cabrales Blue Cheese, Endive, and Walnuts**\n  - Chef: Daniel (location unspecified)"

RED\n- paprika\n- parsley\n- pasta\n- pecans\n- pepper: black, white\n\nIn the narrative section, Michael Anthony from Gramercy Tavern in New York City shares his approach to preparing cabbage. He describes making a fine chiffonade of cabbage that is fried until the edges just get brown, which he discovered by accidentally cooking the cabbage too long initially. He explains that this cooking method actually resulted in a delicious dish, which they now serve with caraway seeds and walnuts, further enhanced with Calvados, cider vinegar, and olive oil. He notes that this combination, although not traditional, complements each other very well, suggesting that it could pair well with braised pork belly or roasted breast of squab. The text emphasizes the lightness and unexpected success of combining these elements."

    "contenu": "**Title:** The Importance of Freshness\n\n**Content:**\n\nFor manzanilla and fino—two light-colored styles of Sherry that experience flor—freshness is critical. In some restaurants and bars outside of Spain, it is not uncommon to be served from a bottle that has been open for months, leading to almost rancid flavor.\n\nIn Jerez, a freshly opened bottle of fino or manzanilla is ideally served well chilled and kept no longer than a single day. Typically, the bottle is finished with the meal, which is the norm in Spain where Sherry is often sold in half-bottles. By comparison, amontillados, olorosos, palo cortados, and creams, which are served at cool room temperature, will last several months after the bottle has been opened, with only a slight diminution of flavor. This is because these Sherries are less fragile and slightly more oxidized initially. If they contain Pedro Ximénez, their sugar content will also act as a preservative.\n\nThe freshness of fino and manzanilla is crucial as they begin to lose their zesty character six months after leaving the solera. The challenge with Sherry, which by law cannot carry a bottled-on or drink-by date, is mitigated by buying only top Sherries and from wine shops that regularly restock. \n\n**Subtitle:** Serrano or Shrimp?\n\n**Content:**\n\nIn Jerez, the traditional pairing of bone-dry fino and thinly sliced serrano ham (or better yet, jamón de Jabugo) is unbeatable. However, pairing gamas a la ajillo (garlic shrimp) and a glass of manzanilla could be considered the ultimate appetizer/aperitif combination due to the salty, briny, olive-scented flavor of manzanilla which complements the fresh shrimp sautéed in olive oil, red chile, and garlic."

DNA analysis confirmed it as distinct from Merlot.\n\n- **Historical Background**\n  - Jean-Michel Boursiquot, a French ampelographer, distinguished Carménère from Merlot based on differences in ripening and taste.\n  - It was initially confused for Merlot in Chilean vineyards.\n  \n- **Production Changes**\n  - Some producers removed old Carménère vineyards to replant with true Merlot.\n  - Others saw an opportunity for innovation in the Chilean wine landscape.\n\n- **Wine Characteristics**\n  - Low in acid and tannin compared to Cabernet Sauvignon.\n  - Produces wines with plush textures and rich flavors (mocha, coffee, green tobacco, spice).\n  - Superior quality Carménère has a notable character but basic versions lack excitement.\n  \n- **Blending Practices**\n  - Blending Carménère with Cabernet enhances the wine, providing structure from Cabernet and fleshy, spicy notes from Carménère.\n  - Example: Neyen’s Espiritu de Apalta benefits significantly from this blend.\n\n- **Genetic Information**\n  - Carménère is a natural cross between Cabernet Franc and Gros Cabernet.\n  - It is distinct from Cabernet Sauvignon, and Gros Cabernet is no longer cultivated.\n\nThe document also features a photo of Chilean \"huasos\" (cowboys) in a rodeo, highlighting their skill in roping a bull. Rodeo is noted as Chile’s national sport since 1962."
