For the honor of having Death & Co be a place that our industry loves to visit, I will be forever grateful. Thank you to every single bartender, chef, spirits maker, brand ambassador, and liquor-industry hooligan for making Death & Co your first stop in NYC and your home away from home, and for teaching us something new every single night.\n\nAbove all else, thank you to my partner in all these boozy shenanigans, Dave Kaplan. He gave me a gig at his exciting new bar when I was in no way qualified to be there, and has since become the counterbalance to my professional neurosis. The day I became a co-owner of Death & Co will forever be one of the greatest of my life. Thank you for including me in this book and allowing me to smudge some pages up here and there.\n\nDave has probably thanked the same people I thank here, but I love them, too, so there. The D&C crew changed my life, both professionally and personally, and I will forever be grateful for the chance to work with such passionate people. That first cocktail Joaquin Simó made me opened my eyes to great drinks, and experiencing it became the most important moment in my professional life. It sent me down the path to putting words on this page. That first terrifyingly shaky trial shift (I forgot the agave nectar in a Oaxaca Old-Fashioned!) with Phil Ward, who turned into a mentor—a man of few words, certainly, but always with insight and wisdom—taught me the value of not accepting mediocrity. Brian Miller, dodging your formidable shake and blistering wit, and being inspired by your obsessive commitment to your work, has been invaluable to every page in this book. Jessica Gonzalez kept pretending she wasn’t a badass bartender, but then she stepped behind the stick and made us all look like newbies. Thomas Waugh, thank you for moving to New York, changing our perspective on cocktails, and bringing an unbridled creativity to the table. Jillian Vose, your leadership in the next era of Death & Co has been invaluable, your dedication unmatched, and your cocktails jaw-dropping; we’d be lost without you. Brad Farran, a lot of your ideas seemed so ridiculous at first, but goddamn do your drinks taste good; thank you for livening up the bar every night and making our guests excited to be on our bar stools. Eryn Reece, by the time this book is out, I’m sure your maniacal professionalism will have taken you great places; I just hope you don’t forget us little people, okay? Tyson Buhler, I couldn’t be more grateful for your time at Death & Co; as with Eryn, your assured greatness will take you far—you’ll probably be a senator or something by the time this book is in print. Way to make us all look like dumb-"

    "contenu": "## The Hôtel Dieu and the Hospices de Beaune\n\nOne of the most prestigious wine events anywhere is the Hospices de Beaune, a charity auction held each November in Beaune’s stunning Hôtel Dieu (literally, “God's House”). Built in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of the duchy of Burgundy, and his wife, Guigone de Salins, the Hôtel Dieu is perhaps the most magnificent refuge ever created for the sick and the destitute. Its numerous enormous rooms include large galleries with curtained bed chambers where the sick slept, two to a bed (for warmth), chapels for the bedridden to attend daily Mass, grand kitchens, and a pharmacy outfitted with distillation stills for the making of medicines. The building's steep roof is covered in dazzlingly colored glazed tiles and can be seen from miles away. Sunlight hitting the roof creates a halo of amazing light. The Hôtel Dieu (now a museum and wine domaine) owns almost 150 acres (60 hectares) of vineyards (much of it classified as Premier or Grand Cru), which have been donated to it over centuries. Each year since 1851, the wines made from these vineyards have been sold in a highly publicized auction that brings in considerable sums to benefit the hospitals of Beaune.\n\n### Bouzeron\n\nBouzeron is the northernmost village of the Côte Chalonnaise. It is known primarily for aligoté. In fact, perhaps the best wine made from aligoté in France is produced here, by Aubert de Villaine, codirector of the prestigious Domaine de la Romanée-Conti in the Côte d’Or.\n\n### Rully\n\nThe village of Rully used to be one of the centers of sparkling wine production in Burgundy, and a fair amount of Crémant de Bourgogne (a sparkling wine produced using the Champagne method) is still produced there. Otherwise, the village is known mostly for its simple pinot noirs and somewhat better chardonnays, which can be crisp and lemony, with nutty overtones.\n\n### Givry\n\nGivry is better known for its pinot noirs, although chardonnays also come from there. Quality, of course, depends on the producer, but there are some very good wines with earthy and cherry flavors.\n\n### Montagny\n\nFinally, Montagny, the small, southernmost village of the Côte Chalonnaise, is exclusively devoted to chardonnay. Many Burgundy insiders consider Montagnys the best-value white Burgundies going, and this village has the highest number of Premiers Crus in the Côte Chalonnaise—forty-nine. Indeed, about two-thirds of the 740 acres (300 hectares) here are ranked Premier Cru and encompass more than fifty named sites. Because of the high proportion of top-rated vineyards within this single, small appellation, the significance of naming the individual vineyard is diluted. Thus, unlike the rest of Burgundy, a majority of Montagny Premier Cru wine is sold without reference to a specific vineyard.\n\n### Some of the Best Producers of the Côte Chalonnaise\n\n- A. & P. de Villaine\n- Dureuil-Janthial\n- François Raquillet\n- J. M. Boillot\n- Joblot\n- Louis Jadot\n- Louis Latour\n- Meix-Foulot"

It is characterized by a terpene called perillaldehyde, offering a fatty, herbaceous, and spicy aroma. Varieties include green, some red to purple, and anthocyanins-lacking types with no perillaldehyde, offering a dill or lemon flavor. Widely used in Japanese cuisine, particularly with seafood and grilled meats. It is also popular in Korean cuisine in pickled plums, umeboshi, and perilla oil.\n\n- **Rosemary**: Known scientifically as *Rosmarinus officinalis*, Rosemary thrives in Mediterranean scrublands. Its narrow, tightly rolled leaves emit a strong composite scent combining notes of pine, floral elements, eucalyptus, and clove. It is prevalent in southern France and Italy, traditionally flavoring grilled meats and complementing sweet dishes. The herb's essence is best preserved through drying.\n\n- **Sage**: Belonging to the genus *Salvia*, the largest in the mint family with approximately a thousand species, sage is used widely for its aromatic and medicinal qualities. Common sage, *S. officinalis*, is known for its camphor content and is occasionally used due to potential toxicity to the nervous system. Other varieties include Greek sage (*S. fruticosa*) and lavender sage (*S. lavandulaefolia*), each offering distinct aromatic profiles.\n\n- **Savory**: Divided into summer savory (*Satureja hortensis*) and winter savory (*Satureja montana*), these herbs are part of the *Lamiaceae* family. Savory is particularly noted for its mixture of oregano and thyme-like flavors due to its carvacrol and thymol content. It is believed to closely resemble oregano, with native variants like *S. douglasii* from North American regions offering a milder, mint-like flavor.\n\n- **Thyme**: *Thymus*, from which Thyme derives its name, has historical roots in Greek sacrificial rites where it was used for its aromatic qualities. The term thyme is associated with the Greek words for \"spirit\" and \"smoke.\" The genus includes 60-70 species, primarily found in Mediterranean areas. It possesses a variety of flavors ranging from common *Thymus vulgaris* to types inflected with lemon, mint, and nutmeg. Noteworthy for containing thymol, thyme offers a distinctively strong yet balanced aroma."

This aging also facilitates the combination of acetic and other acids with various compounds, forming new, less pungent, often aromatic substances.\n\n##### Common Kinds of Vinegar\n- **General**: Cooks can choose from several different vinegars, all featuring the basic qualities essential to vinegar.\n- **Wine Vinegars**:\n  - Made from yeast-fermented grape juice.\n  - Have a winey character with aromatic and savory by-products of yeast fermentation.\n  - Examples include balsamic and sherry vinegars.\n- **Cider Vinegars**:\n  - Produced from yeast-fermented apple juice.\n  - Characterized by apple-specific aroma components and associated esters.\n  - Apple cider vinegars are noted for a malolactic fermentation which softens acidity.\n- **Fruit Vinegars**:\n  - Typically ordinary vinegars flavored by contact or made from fruits.\n  - Noted for potentially higher risks of spoiling if fruits with less than about 10% sugar are used without additional sugar.\n\n##### Making Vinegars in the Kitchen\n- **DIY Vinegar Making**:\n  - Vinegars can be made from leftover wine or fruits.\n  - Using a cultured yeast or a vinegar “mother” helps minimize off-flavors.\n  - Optimal conditions include warmer temperatures (up to about 85°F/30°C) and large surface exposure to air.\n  - Additional table sugar can be added to fruits with low natural sugar to boost alcohol and acetic acid levels and prevent spoiling.\n\n---\n\nThis document section comprehensively covers the final steps in the production of vinegar post-fermentation, the types of vinegars, and guides on making vinegar at home."

Hawthorn strainer\n\n### Julep Strainer\n- **Description**: The Julep strainer is oval-shaped with large holes, allowing for fast straining of stirred drinks.\n- **Features**: Fits inside the mixing cup; the pouring lip of the mixing cup remains unobstructed for fluid pour.\n\n### Hawthorn Strainer\n- **Description**: Equipped with a spring around its edge to fit into a metal shaking tin for straining into multiple glasses.\n- **Functionality**: Designed to strain drinks and remove unwanted bits such as chunks of mint and small ice pieces. This strainer is particularly effective at filtering out debris that would not be caught by the Julep strainer.\n- **Additional Tools**: Often used in combination with a fine tea strainer to catch smaller particles, alleviating issues with large items slipping through.\n- **Complex Usage**: It is considered more challenging to use compared to the Julep strainer. The Hawthorn strainer sits on the outside of the cup and tends to be prone to drips and spills.\n- **Operational Detail**: Bartenders often use an index finger to adjust the strainer up and down (\"adjusting the gate\"), which changes the pouring gap and controls the flow.\n- **Pouring Techniques**:\n  - **Closed Gate**: Holds back ice crystals.\n  - **Open Gate**: Allows more ice crystals to pass through, providing a different texture and cooling quality to the drink."

    "contenu": "# Cinnamon\n\n## Introduction\nThe spices **Cinnamomum zeylanicum** and **Cinnamomum cassia** are often referred to interchangeably as cinnamon, but they are not the same. The sweet brown sticks commonly used in Western, Middle Eastern, North African and Latin American cuisine come from the dried inner bark of **C. zeylanicum** (also known as C. verum), an evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. The bark of the cassia tree, which grows in China and some parts of Southeast Asia, is more potent with a slight bitterness. Most of the jars of ground cinnamon found in supermarkets contain a blend of cinnamon and cassia – or just cassia.\n\n## Historical Context\nCinnamon is thought to have already been used by the ancient Greeks and Romans, probably supplied to them by traders from the Middle East. Finding a source of cinnamon was one of the motivations for the European explorers of the 15th and 16th centuries, and it was discovered to be growing in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) by the Portuguese. Sri Lanka still produces most of the world's cinnamon supply. The French later introduced it to the Seychelles Islands.\n\n## Essential Oils\nEssential oils in the bark of the **C. zeylanicum** tree contain very high concentrations of cinnamaldehyde, which gives the spice its distinctive cinnamon-y flavour. To a lesser degree, camphoraceous volatile compounds like 1,8-cineole, also called eucalyptol, along with clove-scented eugenol, contribute to the spicy fragrance of cinnamon.\n\nLike cinnamon, cassia contains cinnamaldehyde, 1,8-cineole and eugenol, but in different concentrations. The bark of the cassia tree contains less cinnamaldehyde and more coumarin, a molecule with a sweet odour similar to freshly mowed hay. Coumarin is also a key aroma molecule for tonka beans.\n\n## Uses\n- **Cinnamon leaves** have a stronger clove-like scent than the bark. The dried leaves are used in herbal teas or as a substitute for bay leaves in Jamaican stews, curries and pilafs.\n- **Apples and cinnamon** are a popular dessert pairing, from the classic French tarte aux pommes to American apple pie.\n- **Cinnamon in savory dishes:** Used as a sweet and savory seasoning in Middle Eastern or North African dishes, such as Moroccan chicken tagine with apricots and almonds.\n- **Chinese five-spice powder** is a blend of ground cassia, star anise, cloves, fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorns.\n- The pairing of **chocolate with cinnamon**, usually in liquid form, was popular in 16th-century Spain, when the spice was first shipped there.\n\n## Related Aroma Profile: Cassia Bark\nCassia has a warmer, bolder flavor than true cinnamon, with more nutty, woody and phenolic smoky notes. The nuttiness comes not only from almond-like benzaldehyde but also coumarin, which has a hay-like smell with nutty notes.\n\n## Aroma Profile Table\n\nThe table presented on the right-bottom side of the image categorizes different aromas associated with cassia bark (Chinese cinnamon) and their presence (shown as shaded circles) in various food items.\n\n| Food Item            | Cassia Bark (Chinese Cinnamon) Aroma Profile |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Pan-fried wild pigeon| ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Conference pear      | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Melon                | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Baked hare           | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Javape plé           | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Baked flying cohabus | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Dark roasted almond  | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Lime                 | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Cooked black salsify | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n| Poached grey mullet  | ● ● ● ● ●                                      |\n\nEach dot (●) represents a presence of the aroma."

    "contenu": "### Wine at Home\n\n**Home is where we eat most of our meals and drink most of our wine.** But since wine can seem so complicated, even regular drinkers may feel less comfortable serving wine to their guests than when serving other drinks. Most of us don't have wine cellars for storing dozens of bottles or sideboards for dozens of wineglasses, nor should we need to. It’s just a beverage, after all.\n\nWine is a unique agricultural product, in many ways closer to produce or cheese than to vodka or whiskey. Unlike other drinks, it occupies a strange limbo between the perishable items chilled in the refrigerator and the dry goods stored in the cupboard. Beer doesn’t keep well, so we know to buy small amounts and keep it fresh. Spirits are stable enough so that we don’t worry about the bottles spoiling after they’ve been opened. But wine can be perplexing. Some wines can keep very well for years or even decades, whereas others are best consumed when fresh. Yet, they can all be easily damaged with too much heat or light. The serving of wine can be more puzzling still. Beer and cocktails may be sipped from nearly any vessel, but wine benefits greatly when served in specialized glassware. Service temperature dramatically affects wine’s nuance and aromatics, too.\n\n**There is no question that serving wine presents a bit of a challenge.** But whether your family enjoys wine regularly or only when entertaining guests, getting a handle on a few basic concepts will help. Learning a little about how wine works—how it keeps, how it spoils, how to showcase it—will allow us to feel more comfortable with it in our homes every day as well as when pulling a cork on a bottle to share with guests."

Let's break down its structured content:\n\n---\n\n### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n**Introduction:**\nAlthough I am the lone author of this book, and any errors, misinterpretations, or omissions you may encounter are my sole responsibility, in many ways the process of writing it has been highly collaborative. My education in fermentation, although experiential and without any single central mentor figure, has been highly interactive, informed and guided by an uncountable number of communications, in person and via the Internet. I learned the things that made me decide it was time to write this book not only from the people who shared family recipes, or a microbiologist’s perspective, or sent me interesting articles, but from all the people who have posed questions that forced me to reflect and research and further experiment, in order to understand fermentation more deeply, and learn to better explain it. I have no single teacher, but literally thousands of you reading this book have been my teachers. Thank you.\n\n**Acknowledgments to Individuals:**\nMany people, some quoted in the book, many more not, shared fermentation wisdom they have gleaned. With apologies in advance to anyone I have neglected to include in this list, I thank the following people who shared information, ideas, articles, books, images, and stories:\n- Ken Albala\n- Dominic Anfiteatro\n- Nathan and Padgett Arnold\n- Erik Augustijns\n- David Bailey\n- Eva Bakkeslett\n- Sam Bett\n- Áron Boros\n- Jay Bost\n- Joost Brand\n- Brooke Budner\n- Justin Bullard\n- Jose Caraballo\n- Astrid Richard Cook\n- Crazy Crow\n- Ed\n\n(Note: The list of names is apparently incomplete as the document ends abruptly.)\n\n---"

Since the text is in French, I will provide a summarized translation.\n\n### Section 1.3: The 6 Families of Bordeaux Wine\n\n#### Text Summary (Translated):\n\n- **Bordeaux & Bordeaux Supérieur - Red and Rosé Wines for Every Day**:\n  - Bordeaux wines, coming from the largest regional appellation AOC Bordeaux, are usually made from a blend of various grape varieties. Commonly, the Merlot dominates, but is often complemented by Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.\n  - The diversity within Bordeaux wines is vast, yet they generally maintain a common style: balanced, fruity, and smooth, which are easy to drink soon after bottling. Such wines are versatile with food and do not require elaborate ceremonies, making them suitable for everyday enjoyment.\n  - Specifically, wines under the Bordeaux Supérieur appellation tend to be more powerful and are produced under stricter conditions. To ensure quality, these wines must be aged for a minimum of four months and typically have a good aging potential.\n  \n#### - **Typical Aromas**:\n  - Representative flavors include spicy (pepper) and red fruits, with a hint of vanilla. These characteristics can be influenced by the method of winemaking and can complement a wide variety of dishes including red and white meats, grilled dishes, and cheese.\n\n#### Graphic Visualizations:\n1. **Pie Chart**:\n   - Bordeaux red/rosé, 70.8%\n   - Bordeaux supérieur red/rosé, 21.1%\n   - Other (not detailed), 0.1% \n   - Claret, 1.3%\n   - Bordeaux rosé, 6.2%\n  \n2. **Suggested Slide Reference**:\n   - Slides 30 and 31: Detail about Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur wines.\n\nOverall, the image is an educational slide focusing on the diversity and properties of Bordeaux wines, emphasizing their daily suitability and potential complexities within the categories of Bordeaux & Bordeaux Supérieur."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"Washing\" describes a process of \"milk washing\" in cocktail preparation, emphasizing how it can be used to reduce the astringency of alcoholic drinks and to enhance their texture. Here’s a structured outline of the content:\n\n### Washing\n\n**Introduction:**\n- The document starts with a narrative from 2012, where ESPN tasked the author with creating an alcoholic version of the \"Arnold Palmer\" drink. The author concludes that a nonalcoholic Arnold Palmer is superior because alcohol accentuates the tea's astringency.\n\n**Experimentation:**\n- The author experimented by serving several alcoholic Arnold Palmer variants to a film crew, which were not received well due to the intensified astringency from the alcohol.\n- Further reflections led the author to consider how milk is used in the U.K. to soften the astringency of tea due to the binding proteins—casein.\n\n**Process Description:**\n- The author devised a method involving steeping tea in vodka to infuse it, then adding milk to curdle by introducing citric acid, thus clarifying the liquor by removing astringent compounds. This method effectively made the drink more palatable even when chilled.\n- The process is referred to as \"milk washing,\" which not only reduces harshness but also improves the texture of drinks when they are shaken.\n\n**Explanation of \"Washing\" Concept:**\n- The author explains that washing in the context of liquid preparation can involve cleansing away unwanted flavors or substances. This is analogous to washing clothes to remove dirt.\n- Two types of washing in cocktail preparation are detailed:\n  1. **Booze-washing:** Adding elements like milk, gelatin, hydrocolloids, or eggs to bond with and allow for the removal of unwanted compounds in the liquor.\n  2. **Fat-washing:** Using fat to extract favorable flavors into a liquor, which can then be used to concoct flavorful beverages.\n\n**Purpose of Milk Washing:**\n- Reduces astringency.\n- Enhances texture for shaken drinks.\n\nThe text effectively introduces a specialized technique used in cocktail mixing, highlighting how traditional methods (e.g., adding milk to tea) can be innovatively applied in modern culinary practices."

Here is a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Winemaking Process**: \n   - **Grape Crushing**: The grapes are crushed using a wooden hopper and rollers, a method reminiscent of old traditions, such as the scene depicted in the 1950s television show \"I Love Lucy\" where Lucille Ball crushes grapes with her feet.\n   - **Fermentation**: After crushing, the grape skins, stems, and pulp begin fermenting almost immediately:\n     - **White Wines**: The juice is fermented after quickly straining out skins and solids.\n     - **Red Wines**: Fermentation occurs with the skins, which contribute color and tannins.\n\n2. **Specific Winemaking Practices**:\n   - **Pratale (Location unspecified)**: After the initial open vessel fermentation, the wine is transferred to air-locked vessels. The described process varies in the timing of fermentation:\n     - **Etain and Martin's Approach**: They prefer to ferment the wine for a few months until dry before bottling.\n\n3. **Cultural References**:\n   - **Lightly Fermented Wine**:\n     - **Turkey**: Known as 'sira,' it is lightly fermented, sweet, and bubbly with about 2 percent alcohol.\n     - **Germany**: It's called 'federweisser,' a young, partially fermented grape juice.\n\n4. **General Information**:\n   - **Fruit-based Alcohols**: While grapes are commonly used, the document notes that any fruit can be fermented into alcohol.\n   - **Historical Context**: Wine from grapes is noted to have become a global favorite, originating from the Zagros Mountains, in what is today Armenia and Iran, according to Patrick McGovern.\n\nThis concise review highlights both the winemaking process and its cultural significance across different regions."
