Here's a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Dom Pérignon\n- **Background**: Dom Pérignon, a monk whose real name was Pierre Pérignon, contributed significantly to the evolution of Champagne.\n- **Role**: At the age of twenty-nine, he was appointed as the *procureur* (administrator) at the Abbey of Hautvillers, which is now owned by Moët & Chandon.\n- **Contributions**:\n  - **Vineyard Management**: Increased the abbey’s vineyard holdings and enhanced the value of its wine, which by 1700 was worth four times that of basic Champagne.\n  - **White Wine Mastering**: Innovated the production of clear white wine from grape skins known as \"white wine.\"\n  - **Viticulture Practices**: Introduced strict viticulture management techniques including severe pruning and minimal fertilizer use, ensuring grapes were of high quality.\n  - **Harvesting**: Emphasized early morning grape picking to retain delicate aromas and flavors.\n  - **Pressing**: Implemented quick pressing of grapes to minimize oxidation.\n  - **Vinification**: Innovated keeping wines from different vineyards separate and advocated blending several still wines for complexity.\n  - **Packaging**: Experimented with glass flasks to preserve the wine's freshness.\n- **Impact**: All these innovations enhanced the quality of Champagne, which was key to the future commercial success of Champagne.\n   \n### Contribution to the Sparkle of Champagne\n- **Innovation Acknowledgement**: Champagne historians believe Dom Pérignon saw the inherent value in sparkling Champagne, which he helped to popularize.\n- **Voltaire's View**: The document features a quote from Voltaire stating, \"The sparkling froth of this fresh wine is the dazzling image of us, the French.\"\n\n### British Influence\n- **Historical Context**: Around the time of the Industrial Revolution, British wine merchants began importing the still French Champagne and bottling it in Britain.\n- **British Modification**: To cater to local tastes, British merchants added sugar before sealing the bottles, which interacted with natural yeasts to restart fermentation, resulting in a stronger sparkle to the wine when opened.\n- **Cultural Impact**: This new bubbly Champagne was found amusing and distinctive by the British, enhancing its popularity and distinctiveness.\n\nThis document provides an insightful look into the early technological and procedural enhancements in Champagne production, largely influenced by the efforts of Dom Pérignon and later refined by British merchants."

Restaurants need to maintain a profit margin for business sustainability.\n- **Problems**: The restaurateur must set a reasonable price based on customer demographics, purchasing power, and the desire for social recognition. It queries whether to use a variable or fixed markup.\n- **Variable Margin**: The calculation formula is highlighted, which can adjust the selling price by applying different coefficients ranging from 2.5 to 5 based on the cost price excluding tax, where a higher cost implies a higher selling price. The choice of coefficient impacts whether to opt for a large and fixed margin.\n\nThis structured analysis provides a clear perspective on different pricing strategies concerning the sale of wine in a restaurant context, discussing the implications of pricing decisions based on staff compensation and tax considerations."

    "contenu": "### WHAT ALLOWS A WINE TO LAST?\n\nIn order to withstand time and age well, wine must have the right amount of sugar, acid, or tannin. These are the three preservatives in wine. Without a significant amount of any of them, most wines are better off being drunk at the next opportunity.\n\nSugar is clearly a preservative. If you needed some honey and found a jar that had been sitting in the back of your kitchen cabinet for ten years, you’d nonetheless (rightfully) use it. (And a bottle of French Sauternes in your cellar is destined to go the long run.)\n\nLike a jar of honey, an old bottle of vinegar (acid) could always be employed in a salad dressing. Wines high in acid—German rieslings for example—have amazing aging potential.\n\nTannin is the third preservative, but since it comes from the grapes’ skins, it is a factor mainly in red wines. Yet it’s the most obvious entity in most collectors’ cellars, filled as they are with high-tannin wines such as Bordeaux, Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, and Barolo, for example.\n\n#### Caption for Image:\nTo take wine from a barrel, winemakers use a tool called a \"thief\" that can be inserted into the bung hole. A “barrel sample” is usually not fully ready to drink, but it can give the taster an inkling of the wine’s character and what’s to come."

Below is the structured content organized for clarity:\n\n### Cheeses and Pairings\n\n1. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Anchovies**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite (a type of cooked pressed cheese).\n   - Pairing: Anchovies.\n\n2. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Anis**\n   - Cheese: Le mahón from Menorca, described as a pasteurized cow's milk cheese with a salty and citrusy flavor.\n   - Pairing: Traditionally served in thin slices with oregano, olive oil, and black pepper. Noted for being consumed in the CantaI mountains in southern France. Suggested to be served with crackers that incorporate aromatics like tarragon, arnica, and gentian along with sea salt.\n\n3. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Artichaut (Artichoke)**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Preparation: Young artichokes, finely chopped and sautéed with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. The artichokes are prepared by removing all external tough leaves, and slicing them thinly almost to the base, ensuring not to cut off the base entirely.\n   - Recommendation: Serve the mixture over slices of the cheese. Topped finely with Parmesan cheese.\n\n4. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Asperge (Asparagus)**\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Pairing: Asparagus, with a suggestion that folklore attributes mysterious powers to asparagus. The tips of the asparagus should be carefully prepared and served with the cheese, which is described to have a harmoniously sulfurous taste.\n\n5. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Banane (Banana)**\n   - Cheese: Comté, described as young with flavors like nutmeg, apricot dry, caramel, and sweet and sour cream.\n   - Pairing: Banana, especially recommended as a pairing because when heated with the cheese, it releases flavors that complement the nutty and spicy tastes noted in Comté. Suggested to be placed in a slice of bread (possibly of Espelette variety), baked until the cheese melts which emphasizes the distinct flavour fusion inspired by the heat of a pepper.\n\n6. **Fromage à pâte pressée cuite & Basilic (Basil)**\n   - Location: Mention of a restaurant known as La Merenda by Dominique Le Stanc, located in Nice at the Hotel Negresco.\n   - Cheese: Fromage à pâte pressée cuite.\n   - Dining experience: The document describes an innovative dining setup involving minimalism and a selective menu chalked on a slate, where pesto features as a variant devoid of pine nuts, instead made with basil.\n\nEach cheese is showcased with a unique pairing, emphasizing the sensory complementations and cultural culinary practices associated with these pairings."

Here's the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n### Page Title:\nLemon\n\n### Content Description:\n#### Lemon aroma profile\nThe aroma of freshly squeezed lemon juice is primarily a mixture of citral and geranial. The lemony fragrance of these compounds is supplemented by woody-scented terpenines, which have a citrusy nuance, and pinene, which has a camphoraceous, woody, piney scent. Lemons also contain other floral, green, fruity and spicy notes (as indicated in the pairing grid). Lemon and lime have the same pH level, but we perceive lime juice (see the pairing grid on page 87) to be more refreshing due to its fresh, green, grassy notes, which are also present in the fruit's peel, and its hints of camphor and cooling mint.\n\n### Visual Aroma Wheel:\n- Citrus\n- Floral\n- Green\n- Fruity\n- Spicy\n- Resinous\n- Woody\n\n### Lemon Pairing Chart:\nThe chart compares the aroma characteristics of lemon with other foods and flavors in terms of six specific scent profiles: Citrus, Floral, Green, Spice, Resinous and Woody represented in colors (green, purple, yellow, red-brown, aqua blue, dark brown):\n\n```markdown\n| Flavor                   | Citrus    | Floral    | Green     | Spice     | Resinous  | Woody     | Camphor/Cool |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Lemon                    | ●●●●●   | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●●●     | ●       | ●●●          |\n| Cantaloupe               | ●●●       | ●●●      | ●●●●     | ●●        | ●         | ●       |              |\n| Cedar's Orange Pippin apple | ●●●●  | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●         | ●●        | ●       |              |\n| Banana                   | ●●●●      | ●●       | ●●●      | ●         |           |         |              |\n| Mace                     |           | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●●●●     | ●●●       | ●●●●    |              |\n| Oyster                   |           | ●●●●     | ●●●●●    |           |           |         | ●            |\n| Sea urchin               |           | ●●●      | ●●●●     |           |           |         |              |\n| Sumac                    | ●●        | ●●       | ●●●      | ●●●●      | ●         |         |              |\n| Dry-aged beef            |           |           | ●●●      | ●●●●●     | ●●●●      | ●●●●    | ●            |\n| Chicory (Belgian endive) |           | ●●●      | ●●●      | ●●        | ●●        | ●●      | ●●            |\n```\n\nNote: Each colored dot represents the strength or presence of the respective scent profile, with more dots indicating a stronger presence. \n\nThis structured summary provides insight into various flavor characteristics and how they compare to the aroma of lemon."

Tout au long de l'année, le viticulteur effectue un travail minutieux de la vigne qui vise à améliorer la qualité des raisins.\n\n#### Key Annual Activities:\n1. **Fin Octobre:**\n   - **Activity:** Les vendanges sont terminées.\n   - **Details:** Des engrais organiques et minéraux sont apportés à la vigne afin d'éviter toutes carences lors de la prochaine croissance. La protection de la vigne contre les gelées futures est assurée par la buttage (butte de terre placée au pied de chaque cep) et par l'herbe présente autour des pieds qui offre une bonne protection thermique.\n\n2. **Novembre à Mi-Mars:**\n   - **Activity:** Les sarments sont taillés.\n   - **Details:** Ce travail permet d'améliorer la production et la qualité des vignes. C'est une tâche pénible, longue et minutieuse. La palissage est également entrepris pour conserver les rameaux conservés lors de la taille.\n\n3. **Mi-Mars:**\n   - **Activity:** Le cycle végétatif redémarre.\n   - **Details:** La sève monte et s'unit à travers les plaies de taille : la vigne \"pleure\". Les bourgeons apparaissent et sont prêts à éclore, c'est le débourrement. Les gelées nocturnes peuvent compromettre la récolte en brûlant ces bourgeons.\n\n4. **Avril:**\n   - **Activity:** Développement des bourgeons et croissance des rameaux.\n   - **Details:** La croissance des rameaux est très rapide (près de 15 cm par jour). Les meilleurs rameaux sont sélectionnés et attachés au palissage. Les autres sont supprimés lors de l'ébourgeonnage. Les embryons de grappes qui apparaissent sont traités contre les maladies et les insectes nuisibles. Les rameaux sont relevés et palissés régulièrement puis écmés ou rogna. La vigne est déchaussée afin d'aplanir le plan de travail et d'enlever les mauvaises herbes. L'utilisation de cavillonneuse et parfois la main à l'aide d'un tire-cavillon pour retirer les cavillons (reste de terre entre les pieds de vigne).\n\nThis structured format provides an outline of the document’s content focused specifically on the vineyard work throughout different times of the year, highlighting major tasks and their purposes."

A *lieu-dit* is usually tiny (smaller than an appellation or AOC) and usually not inhabited. Sometimes the *lieu-dit* appears on the wine’s label along with the AOC. *Lieux-dits* do not necessarily carry a rank, such as Premier or Grand Cru.\n\nThe term *climat* is sometimes used interchangeably with *lieu-dit*, but the two are actually slightly different. A *climat* is a specific parcel within a vineyard that has unique terroir characteristics. Most *climats* are within classified vineyards. For example, the Grand Cru vineyard Clos de Vougeot has sixteen *climats* that make it up. The name of a *climat* may appear on the label, as is the case with the seven *climats* that make up the single vineyard Chablis Grand Cru (see Chablis, page 212)."

Here are the key points expressed in the document:\n\n1. **Wine Aging and Quality Evaluation**:\n   - The text explains the decision-making process regarding when a wine should be consumed based on its current state and projected development. \n   - Wines that are enjoyable now but are expected to improve in the next few years fall into the category of ‘**can drink now, but has potential for ageing**.’\n   - If the wine is believed to be significantly better after a few more years, suggesting that its current quality would diminish if drunk now, it is considered ‘**too young**.’ This is particularly applicable to wines that are highly tannic at release and need time for the tannins to soften.\n\n2. **Indicators of Decline**:\n   - On the other hand, the text also addresses the situation when a wine is past its prime. If a wine has gone through its aging process and is close to the end of its optimal drinking window, with further changes unlikely to be positive, it should be classified as ‘**drink now: not suitable for ageing or further ageing**.’\n   - The document mentions that if the wine has declined to the point where negative changes dominate, making the wine less enjoyable, it is considered ‘**too old**.’\n\nThis insight helps consumers and wine enthusiasts make informed decisions about when to drink or age wines based on their present qualities and anticipated future development."

Below is an outlined summary of the document’s content:\n\n1. **Types of Fining Agents:**\n   - **Egg Whites**: Protein coagulants, used to attach to the tannin and suspended particles.\n   - **Casein**: A milk protein, serves a similar function to egg whites.\n   - **Gelatin**: Made from skin, tendon, and muscle, used for fining.\n   - **Isinglass**: A gelatinous substance derived from the air bladders of sturgeon, also used for fining.\n\n2. **Functioning of Fining Agents:**\n   - The fining agents work by attaching to tannin and other particles in the wine similar to the mechanism of a Velcro patch, allowing them to be removed easily.\n\n3. **Process Description:**\n   - The fining agent is stirred into the wine, binds with the particles and settles at the bottom of the barrel. The clear wine can then be siphoned off.\n\n4. **Influence on Wine Flavor:**\n   - The flavor of the wine can be impacted by the type of fining agent used as each agent contributes different flavors due to the variety of protein molecules they consist of. \n   - For instance, wines fined with egg whites may taste different from those fined with gelatin.\n\n5. **Specific Uses:**\n   - **Egg Whites**: Notably used in Bordeaux wines, excellent for pulling out excessive tannin.\n\n6. **Activated Carbon as a Fining Agent:**\n   - Derived from charcoal, used for removing extensive impurities.\n   - Leaves the wine neutral in smell and taste, often used in extreme situations like smoke taint from forest fires.\n\n7. **Limitations and Extreme Uses:**\n   - Activated carbon is typically reserved for severe cases such as wines affected by smoke taint, which has been a significant issue in the past decade especially in regions prone to massive forest fires.\n\nThis structured content highlights the different fining agents, their roles, and impact on wine, along with a specific focus on the challenges and use of activated carbon in crisis scenarios."
