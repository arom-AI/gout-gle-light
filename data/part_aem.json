    "contenu": "# Banana\n\n## Aroma Molecules\nOf the 42 different aroma molecules that determine the fragrance of a banana, the compound **isoamyl acetate** smells closest to the actual thing, though it has more of a fruity, overly ripe banana scent. It is frequently used as a flavorant to make banana-flavored foods.\n\n## History and Cultivation\nHumans first learned to cultivate the banana in Papua New Guinea as early as 5000 BC. Today, over a thousand different varieties of banana exist, but an astounding 44 percent of all the bananas consumed around the world are Cavendish bananas, descended from a plant that was first propagated in England back in 1834 by the head gardener at Chatsworth House, the Derbyshire estate of William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire. But it was not until disease wiped out the Gros Michel cultivar in the 1950s that the Cavendish surpassed it to become the world’s most popular fruit. Today, the familiar Cavendish banana ranks as the fourth most valuable cash crop in the world after rice, wheat, and milk.\n\n## Development Challenges\nMost sold commercially now, wither hits the Cavendish, the world's most commercialized fruit, and its high yields and convenient, self-contained packaging, make it more than just a breakfast food, a healthy afternoon snack or a dessert, bananas are an important, nutrient-rich source of energy for many food insecure populations around the world. Unfortunately, the global supply of Cavendish bananas may be under threat. A new strain of Panama disease – the fungus that killed the Gros Michel variety – has been discovered and there is a danger it could spread rapidly through banana plantations. Work is being done to develop new, disease-resistant cultivars.\n\n## Culinary Uses\n- **American banana split**: Three scoops of ice cream – vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – sandwiched between two halves of a banana, drizzled with hot fudge and strawberry and pineapple syrup. This super-deluxe ice cream sundae is finished with whipped cream, chopped nuts, and maraschino cherries.\n- **Malaysian otak-otak**: Little banana-leaf-wrapped parcels of fish and crab mousse mixed with coconut milk and seasoned with chili, lemongrass, makrut lime leaves, and turmeric.\n- **Salvadoran tamales**: Banana leaves are also used to wrap these tamales made from harina de maíz (cornmeal) filled with shredded chicken, hard-boiled eggs, chickpeas, potatoes, capers, and spicy salsa roja.\n\n# Banana Cake with Dulce de Leche Gelato\n\n## Food Pairing Recipe\nThis banana cake's warm ginger and cinnamon spice notes pair nicely with sweet caramel gelato made from dulce de leche. To balance the sweetness and add more depth of flavor, we infused Colombian coffee into the cream base. Serve the banana cake with the dulce de leche gelato and add a drizzle of sweet coffee caramel. A coffee crumble made with fresh coffee grinds adds crunchy texture. Next, we added a few dots of silky cream cheese mousse to help round out the flavors and give this dessert a satisfying, fatty mouthfeel. Fruity slices of fresh banana make a refreshing counterpoint to this dessert's roasted, caramellic flavors."

    "contenu": "# WATER AND FROST\n\nLike sunlight, the water that vines receive must be part of an overall balanced environment. There is no optimal amount. How much water vines need (and when they need it) depends on a number of factors, including the age and size of the vines, the length of the growing season, the temperatures during the growing season, wind, humidity, the drainage and water-holding capacity of the soil, and the spacing of the vines, to name a few.\n\nVines are not arbitrary in the way they grow; they search for water. Well-drained soils encourage the roots to burrow deeper into the earth, where they find a more stable environment of moisture and nutrients. Vines with fully developed root systems can handle drought or other climatic difficulties better.\n\nIn the world’s generally dry wine regions—including parts of California, Washington State, Australia, Chile, Spain, and Portugal—lack of rainfall can be exacerbated by long, droughtlike summers. In the New World, these wine growing regions generally allow irrigation, although increasing limitations on water resources are destined to make viticulture more difficult in these places.\n\nIn most of Europe, irrigation is forbidden (under severe vintage circumstances, restrictions are sometimes temporarily lifted). In Europe, natural rainfall and moisture is often sufficient to grow healthy vines. Prohibiting irrigation is seen as a way of ensuring quality, since vines given excess water can produce swollen grapes with diluted flavors. This “dilution effect” is also, of course, one of the reasons winemakers fear too much rain.\n\nNot surprisingly, timing is everything. In the spring, right before flowering, vines need some water to jump-start growth. Without water at this critical moment, the flowers will not set properly—and therefore will not create grape berries. Water is also critical during veraison, that time in summer when the grapes begin to change color. A lack of water then can lead to excessively small grapes that never achieve maturity.\n\nOne form of water—frost—is unconditionally a threat to grapes and grapevines. Spring frosts may kill buds and shoots and thus destroy the potential for a crop. Early fall frosts can destroy entire swaths of vineyards, or ravage foliage enough that ripening is impeded, resulting in weakly flavored wines. Even in winter, when the vine is dormant, an excessive cold snap can be ruinous. Below 25°F (-4°C), the vine’s trunk may split, leaving it open to infection. After prolonged below-freezing temperatures, the entire vine and root system can die."

Here is the structured content:\n\n---\n\n**Neusiedlersee, Austria: Wine Production Insight**\n\n- **Geographical Significance & Wine Production:**\n  - Neusiedlersee is described as \"a vast shallow lake in the north of the province\" which is key for sweet wine production in Austria. The vineyards for sweet wine production are ideally located on low-lying ground adjacent to the lake, benefitting from autumn mists that arise from both the lake and the adjoining wetland regions.\n\n- **Optimal Conditions for Specific Wine Types:**\n  - These geographical and climatic conditions are deemed ideal for the production of botrytis-affected wines (such as botrytis cinerea, which contributes to the complexity and sweetness of certain dessert wines). Welschriesling is highlighted as one of the most widely used grape varieties for these sweet wines.\n\n- **Variety and Expansion:**\n  - The best red wines in Austria, however, are found away from the lake, predominantly in elevated and hillier terrains to the south. Zweigelt is the most widely planted variety, supported by plantations of Blaufränkisch and St Laurent, along with international varieties like Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\n- **Designations and Regions:**\n  - Neusiedlersee is an important DAC (Districtus Austriae Controllatus, an Austrian wine appellation system similar to France's AOC) particularly for Zweigelt. Additionally, three DACs are appointed for Blaufränkisch, with Mittelburgenland mentioned as the largest of these.\n\n---\n\nThis summary provides insights into the unique aspects of wine production in Neusiedlersee, Austria, highlighting both the regional specialties in white and red wine production and the geographical conditions that influence these wine varietals."

The text elaborates on the chemical and physical properties of alcohol, its impact on food and flavor, as well as an interesting phenomenon observed with strong wines and spirits known as \"tears\" or \"legs.\" Below, I have summarized the main points covered in the document in structured content:\n\n### The Nature of Alcohol\n\n#### Properties of Alcohol\n- **Volatility**: Alcohol is more volatile than water, allowing it to evaporate at a lower boiling point of 78°C/173°F.\n- **Flammability**: Alcohol's flammability enables the creation of flaming dishes in culinary applications without burning the food, as alcohol’s combustion absorbs the heat.\n- **Freezing Point**: Alcohol has a much lower freezing point than water (−173°F/−114°C), which facilitates concentrating alcoholic liquids in colder environments.\n\n#### Interaction with Food\n- Alcohol affects food by:\n  - **Evaporation**: Helps carry and modify flavors through evaporation during cooking.\n  - **Aromas Binding**: Alcohol can bind aromas in foods and drinks, inhibiting their release; this is prominent in dishes with high alcoholic content.\n  - At low concentrations, alcohol can enhance the release of fruity esters and other aromatic molecules during cooking, improving the dish's flavor profile.\n\n#### Alcohol and Flavor\n- **Sensory Experience**: Alcohol affects the senses of taste, smell, and touch, adding complexity to the flavor of food.\n- **Physical Impact**: High concentrations of alcohol can produce an irritating and warming sensation in the mouth and throat.\n- **Flavor Retention**: In cooking, alcohol acts as a solvent for flavor compounds, though much of it evaporates or is diminished by long cooking durations.\n\n#### The Tears of Strong Wine and Spirits\n- Describes the phenomenon of \"tears\" or \"legs\", which are films of liquid formed inside a glass of strong alcoholic beverages. This occurs due to the interplay between alcohol and water, where alcohol reduces the attraction between water molecules, creating a dynamic that leads to the formation and movement of these tears along the glass.\n\nThis summary captures the document's key points about the nature and characteristics of alcohol, particularly regarding its culinary relevance and its unique physical behaviors."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various methods and substances related to the preparation and preservation of plant-based ingredients, highlighted under different headings within a section titled \"EDIBLE PLANTS.\" Below is the structured content of the document concerning these methods and substances:\n\n### Ice Cream Textures\n- The texture of ice cream, including its smoothness and creaminess, is influenced by the sugar and solid contents in the plants, and the process of freezing. The formation of small crystals is encouraged for a smoother texture, achieved by stirring and churning during freezing. Serving ice cream immediately after removing it from the freezer ensures it remains soft and creamy.\n\n### Vegetable Stocks\n- Vegetable stock is a flavorful liquid made by simmering vegetables until they soften, which breaks down their cell walls and releases nutrients into the water. These nutrients include salts, sugars, acids, and aromatic amino acids. Carrots, celery, and onions are typical ingredients due to their aromatic qualities. The text details the process of maximizing surface area for better extraction, and the importance of not diluting the extracted flavors excessively. Proper proportions and the method of preparation (uncovered simmering) are prescribed for optimal results.\n\n### Flavored Oils, Vinegars, Syrups, Alcohols\n- Extracting flavors from fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices into liquids like oils and syrups involves several preservation considerations to prevent spoilage and maintain flavor, especially given the risks from microbes like botulinum bacteria. Flavors extracted more rapidly in hot conditions and precautions for cold storage are discussed. The section also mentions the inclusion of alcohol (like vodka) for its neutral flavor and preservative quality in flavor extracts like vinegar and syrups.\n\n### “Chlorophyll”\n- The section elaborates on a culinary technique for extracting chlorophyll from green leafy vegetables to create a vibrant green coloring agent. This involves grinding, soaking, and gently simmering the greens to protect against damaging enzymes and to allow the chloroplasts to rise and create a distinct green color. The nuanced differences between chemical and culinary chlorophyll are also pointed out, along with the tip to add chlorophyll at the last minute to acidic foods to preserve its vivid color.\n\nOverall, the document serves as an informative guide on the various techniques used to extract and preserve natural flavors and colors from plants, explaining both the methods and scientific principles behind them."

Here’s the content presented in a structured manner:\n\n### Page Content Heading: FLAVORINGS FROM PLANTS\n\n#### Mastic:\n- **Description:** Mastic is highlighted as a resin obtained from the bark of a small Mediterranean evergreen tree, used mainly in Greek dishes and alcoholic beverages (ouzo). The primary aromatic components are terpenes, notably pinene and myrcene.\n- **Uses:** Mastic is not water-soluble and must be finely ground, then mixed with another powder ingredient, such as flour or sugar, to help disperse it evenly in recipes.\n\n#### Nigella:\n- **Description:** Nigella is derived from the seed of `Nigella sativa`, a close Eurasian relative of ornamental plants. It has a flavor described as a milder form of thyme or oregano, with a hint of caraway.\n- **Uses:** It is commonly used in Indian, Middle-Eastern, and South West Asian breads and other dishes.\n\n#### Saffron:\n- **Description:** Saffron, made from the flower of `Crocus sativus`, is noted as the world's most expensive spice due to the intense labor required to harvest and process it. It was originally domesticated in Greece during the Bronze Age and has spread globally.\n- **Historical Spread:** From Greece in 500 BCE, it traveled to the Middle East, then westward to Spain by the Arabs and to England via the Crusaders.\n- **Production:** It requires a labor-intensive process where dried stigmas must be collected and processed on the same day they open.\n- **Stats and Context:** Producing a small amount (1 pound) of dried saffron involves 70,000 flowers. Iran and Spain are the largest current producers and exporters.\n- **Uses:** In Spain, Iran, and other countries, it is primarily used in rice dishes like pilaf, paella, and others.\n\n#### Saffron Part Details:\n- **Saffron Crocus Parts:** Explains how pure saffron consists of dried stigmas, which are the deep red tips that catch pollen.\n- **Quality Indications:** Second-quality saffron often includes pale, relatively flavorless styles.\n\n#### Color and Chemical Composition:\n- **Saffron Color:** Derived from carotenoid pigments, specifically mentioning crocin as the most abundant form, which is a molecular sandwich of pigment molecules with sugars on each end. This combination makes it water-soluble, thus ideal for extracting in hot liquids.\n- **Usage as a Colorant:** Due to its solubility, saffron is effective as a coloring and flavoring agent in milk and rice dishes. \n\nThis detailed description provides insights into the cultivation, historical significance, and uses of mastic and saffron within various culinary applications across different cultures."

While some bars might offer any random cocktail, this particular bar takes the responsibility seriously and seeks to find the perfect drink for every guest, which involves quick thinking and decision-making by the bartenders.\n\n**Process Described:**\nThe process involves bartender Alex Day, who starts with the current menu and narrows down choices based on the situation. For efficiency in communication, each drink specification uses bartender's shorthand where each number represents the quantity (in ounces) of each ingredient, and \"DB\" stands for “dash of bitters.”\n\nUnfortunately, the image does not display the entire flow chart or additional detailed content beyond this descriptive part, so I'm unable to provide further structured data about the flow chart’s contents.

Here’s a structured summary of the key content provided in the document:\n\n### 1.3 Les 6 familles de vins de Bordeaux\n\n#### Saint-Emilion-Pomerol-Fronsac - Le royaume du Merlot\n- **Location**: Approximately 40 km east of Bordeaux, centered around the town of Libourne, along the Dordogne River.\n- **Area**: The vineyards cover around 12,000 hectares.\n- **Climate**: Characterized as an oceanic temperate climate with Mediterranean influences.\n- **Soil**: Composed mainly of calcareous and gravelly soils.\n- **Predominant Grape**: Merlot, which finds ideal growing conditions here due to the soil composition.\n- **Notable Wine**: Exclusively produces red wines.\n- **Cabernet Franc Influence**: Although Merlot predominates, the influence of Cabernet Franc is significant, as it thrives particularly well in the calcareous soils.\n\n#### Historical and Cultural Significance\n- **Medieval Village**: Saint-Emilion itself is a medieval village founded by the monk Emilion. The village developed religious orders and heightened viticulture quality.\n- **Quality Assurance**: Since 1951, the *Jurade of Saint-Emilion* has controlled wine production, emphasizing quality through a specific label that guarantees the quality as judged by a tasting jury. This system predates the AOC appellation controlée rules applied in Bordeaux since 1974.\n- **UNESCO World Heritage**: In 1999, Saint-Emilion and its vineyards were classified as a World Heritage site, celebrating not just the wines but the region's cultural heritage and picturesque landscapes. This designation intended to safeguard both natural and human-shaped environments.\n- **Viticulture**: Vineyard management remains small-scale, dominated by family-owned plots where the average estate often does not exceed five hectares, in contrast to other regions of Bordeaux, where plots average around 13.5 hectares.\n\nAdditionally, the document includes educational details about the region's climatic influences, soil types, and viticulture development over centuries, emphasizing important contributions from local religious communities and ongoing quality initiatives."

Rehydrate the dry seaweeds. Desalinate fresh seaweeds by rinsing them thoroughly. Also rinse the capers and peel the shallot. Chop the seaweeds and shallot finely, squeezing out as much water as possible.\n2. In a blender, combine all ingredients except the oil and mustard. Mix until you get a smooth texture.\n3. Add the oil and mustard, then mix again until the mixture is well-emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.\n4. Store the tartare in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\n**Chef’s Tip:**\n- If using salted capers, rinse them long and thoroughly to remove excess salt, which provides a balanced acidity for the tartare. Optionally, enhance with a bit of lemon or vinegar according to taste.\n- Avoid using kombu, as it might make the texture too thick.\n\n**Good to Know:**\n- This tartare is excellent as an appetizer on bread and can also be served with steamed vegetables or cooked leafy vegetables, making it a versatile dish.\n- For more about rehydrating dry seaweeds and desalinating fresh seaweeds, refer to page 99 and 97, respectively. \n\n--- \n\nThis recipe appears to be from a larger publication possibly oriented towards innovative or vegetarian dishes, indicated by the tab \"Les recettes\" and a category listing including \"Champignons / Cèpes / Algues.\""

The deeper nature of a good wine is revealed by its taste, complexity, and how long its flavor persists.\n   - Swirling, sniffing, and sipping (the three S’s) are emphasized as the starting point to understand and appreciate the quality of wine, and to tune in to the subtleties of flavor relating to one's taste buds.\n\n2. **Labeling and Appearances:**\n   - Front labels may be misleading. Instead, the information on the back label provides more insight into the wine's origins, the types of fruits used, and insights into the aging process and regions of origin.\n\n3. **Engaging the Senses:**\n   - When tasting, one should allow the wine to envelop the tongue to fully discern its flavors. By doing so, one can better appreciate the influence of weather conditions and climates on the wine's production.\n\n4. **Personal Taste:**\n   - Wine appreciation is subjective. Finding a wine that resonates with one's personal taste involves exploring different varietals from various regions.\n   - There's an encouragement to explore wines globally, indicating that a fine wine not only offers taste but also beauty and enjoyment.\n\nThe document approaches wine tasting not just as a sensory experience but also as an intellectual pursuit that involves understanding the processes behind wine production and appreciating the nuances brought forth by geographical and climatic factors. The conclusion holds that a deep, thorough examination and enjoyment of wine can be both a personal and explorative journey."

    "contenu": "---\n### Mourvèdre\n\nSpain is the ancestral home of Mourvèdre, which is the fourth most widely planted red-wine grape in the country. Grape sleuths have tracked its origin to Valencia, specifically to the town of Murviedro. Interestingly, there’s also a municipality called Mataro near Barcelona. Origins aside, Mourvèdre/Monastrell is grounded in the region of Murcia and its *denominaciones de origen* (or DO, the Spanish equivalent of the French AOC or Italian DOC) of Jumilla and Yecla, and in Valencia, where it thrives in Alicante. Although it has traditionally been used to boost volume rather than quality, some growers are experimenting with reducing the yields. In Murcia, where many vineyards are very old, the fruit is capable of making excellent wines full of black fruit, rich dark spice, fresh green herbs, and a leathery gaminess. Local Monastrell-based *rosados* are also very good, but they’re hard to find in the United States.\n\nFrance’s Mourvèdre is a wonderful interpretation of the grape. It’s planted across the southern swath of the country, from the Languedoc, not far from the Spanish border, west to Provence and specifically Bandol, where it is at its best. In the western Languedoc, Mourvèdre’s chief role is as a blending grape with Cinsaut, Carignan, and similar grapes that dominate the vineyard landscape. Mourvèdre produces inky-dark wines, and its depth can supplement qualities lacking in the main varieties of the region. Its success as a blending wine has motivated many producers to produce varietal Mourvèdre wines, which can be quite good and exceptional values. Farther east, in the heart of the Rhône Valley, the variety plays a similar role in Côtes du Rhône blends, though it’s not widely planted; it plays a larger part in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, where it’s thought to add a specific structure and spice to the mix of thirteen grapes. It’s in Provence, though, that Mourvèdre, under the label of Bandol, makes the most interesting wines. It may not always comprise 100 percent of the cuvée, but it’s usually far more than the minimum percentage required for the appellation, and its signature notes of cracked black pepper, gamy meat, spice, and scented black fruit are unmistakable. It makes a similar, though lower-key contribution in the rosé wines from the same appellation and is, of course, a component of most red and rosé wines labeled Côtes de Provence.\n\nIn the United States, Mourvèdre, often called Mataro, is a beloved grape, though the acreage planted to it is not vast. In California, where it is most widely planted, it is said to lack some of the structure and pigment for which it is known in Europe, but nevertheless it makes very good wines both on its own and in Rhône-style blends (Ridge Vineyards has made a tasty Mataro for years). The American wine shows more fruit and less pepper and spice than its European cousins, although promising new plantings in eastern Washington have more in common with the Old World bottlings. Australia’s Mourvèdre (or Mataro) is concentrated in South Australia and is an integral part of several popular GSM (Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre) blends. Sadly, a lot of the older Mataro vineyards have been ripped up and planted with other varieties, to the detriment of Rhône-style blends Down Under. There’s no significant quantity of Mourvèdre grown in the rest of the world, although it can be found in both South Africa and Portugal, and undoubtedly in small quantities elsewhere, too."

The deep, navigable river quickly became so important to trade that the harbor at its mouth is credited with helping New York City become one of the world’s most prominent cities.\n\nThe vineyards of the Hudson River Valley, first planted in 1677 by French Huguenots, are the oldest in New York State. They begin just 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Manhattan. Of the region’s thirty-nine wineries, most are small or medium size, and production focuses on vinifera and some hybrid varieties. Perhaps the most forward-thinking winery in the region is Millbrook, owned by John Dyson, the former state commissioner of agriculture and markets and also the owner of the prominent Sonoma pinot noir-oriented winery Williams-Selyem.\n\n---\n\n**Caption:**\n*Wish you were here!

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content in markdown format from the document:\n\n# CALCULATING DILUTION\n\nAfter lots of testing, the author came up with an equation to estimate dilution from stirring and shaking that takes only initial alcohol content into consideration. It works well for the range of alcohol content in cocktails. Ignoring sugar content in these equations, alcohol by volume must be input as a decimal (22 percent would be 0.22) and dilution is returned as a decimal percent. Dilution measurements derived by measuring a series of cocktails and fitting them to a curve using Excel.\n\n**Equations for Dilution:**\n\n- Dilution of a stirred drink stirred quickly with 120 grams of ¼-inch cubes for 15 seconds: \n  - **Dilution ratio** = -1.21 x ABV^2 + 1.246 x ABV + 0.145\n- Dilution of a shaken drink shaken with 120 grams of ¼-inch cubes for 10 seconds: \n  - **Dilution ratio** = 1.567 x ABV^2 + 1.742 x ABV + 0.203\n\n# STRUCTURE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRINKS\n\nThe guidelines for specific drink styles are based on the analysis of forty-five classic cocktails—built, stirred, shaken, and shaken with egg white—and ten carbonated and blender recipes of my own. In the chart here accompanying the recipe sheet, you can peruse all the values for yourself. All the numbers represent typical ranges, not hard-and-fast rules, and outliers in the typical ranges that are presented.\n\n## Built Drinks\nBuilt drinks are typically almost entirely liquor, so their alcohol by volume is very dependent on the strength of their base liquor. As sipping drinks served on a rock, built drinks must taste good over a range of dilutions. This range makes it impossible to come up with a sugar-to-acid ratio—the proper ratio would constantly change as dilution changed. As a result, built drinks typically contain little or no acid.\n\n### Recipe Example for Built Drink:\n- **Recipe volume:** 2⅓–2½ ounces (70–75 ml)\n- **Initial alcohol by volume:** 34–40%\n- **Initial sugar and acid content:** roughly 9.5 g/100 ml sugar, no acid\n- **Dilution:** roughly 24%\n- **Finished drink volume:** 2⅓–3⅓ ounces (88–93 ml)\n- **Finished alcohol by volume:** 27–32%\n- **Finished sugar and acid content:** roughly 7.6 g/100 ml sugar, no acid\n\n## Stirred Drinks\nStirred drinks usually have some acidity but are not tart. They have a wider range of alcohol levels than other drinks do."

    "contenu": "### WARNING: THIS LABEL IS MISLEADING\n\n**“Contains Sulfites.”** With the initiation of that federally mandated warning label in 1988, wine drinkers began to worry. What were sulfites and why were they suddenly being put into wine? In the confusion that followed, wine was blamed for everything from headaches to rashes.\n\n**The facts are these:** Wine has always contained sulfites. The compounds occur as a natural by-product of fermentation. Historically, winemakers have also added small, controlled amounts of sulfites to wine to prevent oxidation and spoilage.\n\n**Widespread concern over sulfites** first occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the dawn of the salad bar. Cut vegetables and fruits were routinely sprayed with large amounts of sulfites (up to 2,000 parts per million—[ppm]) to keep them from wilting and turning brown. The FDA received reports of cases of adverse reactions from several hundred people. In response, strict regulations were enacted to protect the estimated 0.4 percent to 1 percent of the population, most of them severe asthmatics, who are considered at risk.\n\n**Historically, however,** the regulations on sulfites in wine have been stricter than those applied to salad bars. In wine the upper limit is 350 ppm. In practice, most wines today contain 100 ppm or less. In wineries where the grapes are healthy and unbruised, and where sterilized equipment is used, the amount of sulfites in the wine may be far less. Several wines around the world are now made entirely without added sulfites. And, of course, wine isn't the only product in the sulfite discussion.\n\n**Sulfites are found in** beer, cocktail mixes, cookies, crackers, pizza crust, flour tortillas, pickles, relishes, salad dressings, olives, vinegar, sugar, shrimp, scallops, dried fruit, and fruit juice, among other foods and beverages.\n\n**When sulphur is used in winemaking** in small, judicious doses, it cannot be smelled or tasted. Nor is it responsible for headaches, according to scientists. Current research suggests that wine-related headaches are probably more often the result of a simple imbalance: More alcohol has been consumed than water. And there’s another possibility as the culprit—glycoproteins. Discovered in 2010 by Italian scientists, glycoproteins are proteins coated with sugars and are produced naturally as grapes ferment. The Italian research team found that many grape glycoproteins have structures similar to known allergens, including proteins that trigger allergic reactions to ragweed and latex.\n\n**Finally ready to be separated** from the skins for good, the wine is drained off to begin the aging process. This wine, known as free run, is the best possible, and all luxury wines are made from it. The remaining mixture of wine and solids is gently pressed to release additional wine. This lightly pressed juice (called first press) may not be as virgin al as free run, but it often contains valuable tannin, as well as flavor and aroma components.\n\n**Fruity red wines meant to be quaffed** but not contemplated will usually be kept for a few months in a tank or vat, then bottled. More serious reds will go into small barrels for periods ranging from several months to a few years, depending on the potential complexity and structure of the wine. The barrels are virtually always oak. In them, complex chemical interactions will take place that gradually and subtly alter the wine’s aroma, flavor, and texture (see What Oak Does, page 48).\n\n**An important part of barrel aging** is the racking of the wine. Racking is simply the process of allowing solids to settle to the bottom of the vat or barrel, then pouring or drawing the clear wine off. Depending on the grape variety, a red wine may be racked numerous times as various types of solids continue to precipitate out. Racking also aerates the wine, helping it mature.\n\n**During aging, there’s another winemaking process** that is sometimes utilized: fining. Fining helps remove excessive tannin, thus, hopefully, making the wine softer and less bitter, and improving its balance. Fining can also clarify minute solids such as unstable proteins."

    "contenu": "The document is divided into several sections discussing various aspects associated with \"Wine and the Law.\" Here is a summary and structured analysis of the document:\n\n### Title: Wine and the Law\n\n### Text Analysis:\n\n1. **French Wine Labeling - PGI and Traditional Terms**\n   - The text explains the French term \"Indication géographique protégée (IGP)\" used on wine labels instead of the traditional \"Vin de Pays\", highlighting the local laws governing where and how wines can be produced.\n   - The use of PGI aims to protect the wine’s quality, prevent fraud, and ensures that the wine’s identity matches its geographical origin.\n   - PGI allows non-traditional varieties to be used (e.g. Sauvignon Blanc in the south of France), offering flexibility beyond the stricter PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) regulations.\n\n2. **EU vs. Non-EU Wine Labels and Regulations**\n   - This section contrasts wine labeling conventions in the EU and non-EU countries.\n   - The document mentions an example of wine labels from Burgundy (Chablis) and California (Robert Mondavi Winery), illustrating differences in label contents such as the region, variety, and wine category.\n   - In non-EU countries, almost all wine labeling does not conform to the GI system, allowing greater flexibility but varying greatly between countries.\n\n3. **European Wine Production Flexibility**\n   - The category without a GI (Geographical Indication) offers more flexibility in production, allowing for multi-regional blends and wines sourced from different EU countries without strict production location restrictions. Specific individual regulations for each geographic designation are outlined in a referenced book section.\n\n4. **Legally Defined Quality and Style Indications**\n   - This segment touches on the evolution of wine labeling to reflect both style and quality, which is strictly defined by local laws within the EU and observed by all member countries.\n   - It references traditional wine distinctions such as those from Australia, noted for high-quality fortified wines traditionally labeled using Sherry terms like Fino and Amontillado, although direct copying of these terms is now restricted.\n   \n5. **Safe Consumption**\n   - The last part briefly mentions the safe consumption of alcohol, acknowledging both its cultural acceptance in moderation and potential health risks when consumed excessively.\n\n### Notable Features:\n- **Structured Data:** An inferred table could outline the comparison of EU and Non-EU label features, noting key differences in labeling practices.\n- **Visual Elements:** There are images of wine labels that serve as examples of the concepts discussed.\n- **Referenced Sections:** Specific regulations related to the discussed topics are said to be elaborated in Section 3 of the book, indicating further detailed reading available beyond this introduction. \n\nThis breakdown helps in understanding the document's comprehensive dive into the intricacies of wine law and labeling, particularly in distinguishing between practices in European and non-European regions."

    "contenu": "This document discusses the author's personal technique for making yogurt and insights into yogurt cultures. Here’s the structured summary of the main points covered in the document:\n\n1. **Yogurt Making Technique:**\n   - The author skims off the top of the stored yogurt, consumes it, and leaves around half an inch in the container.\n   - The remaining yogurt is filled with whole milk and left to sit at room temperature for 24 hours covered with cheesecloth.\n   - The vessel is shifted every three or four times it's made to a clean container without cooking or stirring.\n   - The process described by the author is simple and has been used successfully for nine years, although the resulting yogurt is somewhat runny.\n\n2. **Experience with Aged Yogurt:**\n   - The author mentions neglecting the yogurt for three to four weeks, which leads to the formation of a yellow/brown/orange rind of spoilage.\n   - Despite this spoilage, digging underneath can reveal salvageable white yogurt, allowing for the continuation of the batch.\n\n3. **Yogurt Cultures:**\n   - Mentions a rumor about a long-lived “Bulgarian-Japanese yogurt culture,” suggesting an unrealistic lifespan, though unverified.\n   - Through personal experience, the author has maintained not one, but two cultures (Bulgarian and Greek) for over a year.\n   - Discussed the challenge with store-bought yogurt cultures, which tend to lose effectiveness after a few generations due to their lab-origin strains, in contrast to traditional cultures which are more robust and self-perpetuating.\n\nThis passage appears to be from a book by the author discussing traditional methods of making yogurt at home and exploring different cultures associated with yogurt-making."
