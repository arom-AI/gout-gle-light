    "contenu": "### BORN TO RHÔNE\n\n**Randall Grahm and Bonny Doon Vineyard**\nRandall Grahm, the owner of Bonny Doon Vineyard, is an MIT-educated intellectual from the mid-eighties. Grahm was initially known for his innovative approach in winemaking at Bonny Doon, located in Santa Cruz. He is recognized for his idiosyncratic wines and unique methods of showcasing them, such as suspending Bonny Doon's flying machine from the ceiling of the tasting room.\n\n**A Shift to Rhône Varieties**\nDuring the 1970s in Los Angeles, Grahm started as a wine shop sales clerk and later founded Bonny Doon with financial support from his family. Grahm's turning point came within a decade when he embraced Rhône varieties, particularly syrah, grenache, marsanne, and roussanne. His first notable success was Cigare Volant, a style inspired by French Rhône wines. This wine catapulted him to fame and he began producing many successful varieties, which had been largely overlooked by other California winemakers at the time.\n\n**Other Notable Wineries in Monterey**\n- **David Bruce Winery**: Known for its pinot noirs, this winery embraces variations that range from great to eccentric, building a cult following.\n- **Mount Eden Vineyards**: Famous for its estate chardonnays, which were first planted in 1948 on a mountain crest in Monterey.\n\n**Monterey County Wine Region**\nMonterey County is the largest appellation in the northern part of the Central Coast, spanning about 40,000 acres of vines. This region, known for its fertile Salinas Valley, is dubbed the \"lettuce capital of the world\" and produces over 50 percent of the U.S. vegetables including broccoli, strawberries, mushrooms, spinach, artichokes, and chili peppers.\n\nMonterey's wine recognition only emerged in the 1960s and 1970s post extensive urban development in cities like San Jose and Santa Clara, which pushed vineyard investments southward due to soaring land prices in areas like Sonoma and Napa.\n\nThe climate of southern Monterey can be extremely hot, but the northern part benefits from chilly tunnel winds from the northern Pacific, crucial for cooling the coastal vineyards and promoting slow grape ripening. However, severe winds can inhibit photosynthesis by causing the bushes to shut down, which poses a challenge in an already cool climate region."

Here's a structured content representation:\n\n### Riesling Wine Characteristics\n- **General Profile**: Rieslings from cooler climates, like Clare and Eden valleys in Australia, are typically vibrant and fresh, known as \"tightrope\" wines due to their balanced nature. In comparison, Rieslings from warmer regions, such as California, tend to be softer and less precise in their mineral flavors.\n- **Misconceptions on Sweetness**:\n  - **Common Assumption**: People often expect Riesling to be sweet.\n  - **Reality**: Most Rieslings globally are dry, with the exception of intentionally sweet styles like Beerenauslese (BA) and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA).\n- **Sweetness Determination**: The International Riesling Foundation (IRF) has developed a Riesling Taste Profile chart to assist in pinpointing whether a Riesling is sweet or dry based on technical guidelines such as sugar-to-acid ratio and the pH of the wine.\n\n### Sangiovese Wine Characteristics\n- **Regions**:\n  - **Primary**: Central Italy, specifically Tuscany (notable for Chianti Classico, vino nobile di Montepulciano, and brunello di Montalcino).\n  - **Other Regions**: Umbria and Emilia-Romagna in Italy; limited production in California.\n- **Genetics and Variations**:\n  - **DNA Research (2004)**: Identified one parent of Sangiovese as being from southern Italy (Calabrese di Montenuovo).\n  - **Varietal Complexity**: Variations in clones (hundreds to thousands) due to genetic instability.\n- **Soil and Style Variance**: Depending on the quality of the soil, Sangiovese wines can vary from poor (dry and dreary) to excellent (earthy, rich, and complex).\n- **Traditional Pairing**: Best combined with peppery extra virgin olive oil due to its earthy and rich flavor profile.\n\nThis summarizes the detailed points mentioned in the document about Riesling and Sangiovese wines."

It's recognized for its ability to influence the wine's astringency, which often results in a mouth-drying sensation. Despite this, tannin is indispensable in the wine-making process, contributing to the wine’s structure, aging potential, and overall quality. It is known for imparting complex flavors which might be bitter, harsh, or coarse.\n- **Source**: Tannins are derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of red grapes, and smaller quantities from oak barrels used during the aging process.\n- **Benefits**: Tannin contributes to the wine's velvety texture and aging capability. Additionally, tannins have health benefits linked to compounds found in them.\n\n#### Background on Zelma Long:\n- **Career Overview**: Zelma Long is noted as a significant figure in the world of wine, particularly notable for pioneering roles for women in the field. She first studied enology and viticulture at the University of California, Davis, began her career at Robert Mondavi Winery, and later moved on to become a prominent figure at Simi Winery and partner at Long Vineyards in Napa Valley. With over 30 years of experience in the industry, she and her husband Phil Freese also manage Vilafonté winery in South Africa, focusing on innovative wine production and vineyard management.\n- **Contributions**: Apart from her winemaking endeavors, Long has a profile in international wine-making consultation.\n\n### Footer:\n- Page Number: 65\n- Section Title: WINE TASTING\n\nThis document provides insights into the importance of tannins in wine production, emphasizing their crucial role in the quality and experience of red wine while highlighting Zelma Long's impactful career in the winemaking industry."

This marinade is also excellent for boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes and skewered. Chicken can marinate for 4 to 5 hours, fish, and shrimp need only a 1-2 hour marinade, as the yogurt and citrus have a tenderizing effect."

    "contenu": "### WHERE AND HOW SHOULD I STORE WINE?\n\nThe ancient Greeks mixed wine with honey (sugar acts as a preservative), poured olive oil on top of it (as a barrier to air), and stored it in large ceramic amphorae buried in the ground to keep the wine cool. For thousands of years, wine lovers have been motivated to store wine in a way that keeps it as wine, rather than expensive vinegar.\n\nBy the sixteenth century, much of the wine traded throughout Europe was high in alcohol and further fortified with brandy to preserve it. The base wine itself may have come from any warm place along the Mediterranean, from southern Spain to Crete. In many cases, the origin did not matter; what was important was that the raw wine be fortified sufficiently that it would still be drinkable when it reached England, Ireland, or northern Europe. Any wine that was not fortified was drunk immediately. These young, fresh wines were highly desirable. For most of history, in fact, young wine was always more expensive than old. Intentionally storing wine to age it came into practice only after the eighteenth century, when bottles came into widespread use. When aged in a bottle with a tight-fitting cork, wine not only did not turn to vinegar, but some of it actually improved—sometimes markedly so, especially if it was red. For the first time, certain older wines began to command a higher price than young wines. And “laying a wine down” to better it began to take on sophisticated connotations.\n\nCork—the historic closure for wine—is a miraculous material. But the 20th century gave us an additional asset: well-made, expensive screw caps.\n\nThe legacy remains. Aging a wine still seems like the right thing to do with a moderately expensive wine, even though the fact that most modern wine is actually not meant to be aged for long periods of time. Virtually all white wines and rosé wines are made to be drunk fresh and young. Even among red wines, only those with firm structure and impeccable balance are meant for the long haul. The French make a distinction."

Below is a structured summary of the document:\n\n1. **EU and National Wine Laws**\n   - **Context**: Each wine-producing country in Europe has specific national designations for wine, such as France's Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée (AOC) and Italy's Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC). \n   - **Introduction of EU Laws**: In 2009, the European Union introduced its own set of wine laws that apply to all member countries, including major wine producers like France, Italy, and Spain.\n\n2. **Main EU Wine Designations**\n   - **PDO (Protected Designation of Origin)**: This labeling is used for wines that are produced, processed, and prepared in a specific geographical area, and whose quality or properties are significantly or exclusively determined by the geographical environment.\n   - **PGI (Protected Geographical Indication)**: This designation allows wineries to use either their national labels or the PGI designation from the EU. For example, wines from the Bordeaux or Champagne areas can use either the French AOC or the EU PGI labels.\n\n3. **Usage and Impact of These Designations**\n   - **French Wineries**: They have the choice to label wines under commonly known national terms (e.g., *vin de pays*) or the newer EU terms like PGI.\n   - **Adaptations**: The term PGI, abbreviated from the French *Indication Géographique Protégée*, is gaining preference, and the use of traditional terms like *vin de pays* is now accompanied by the mandatory use of the PGI logo on labels.\n\n4. **Goals of EU Regulations**\n   - **Protection and Unification**: The EU aims to provide consumer protection and a unified labeling system that clearly identifies the quality and origin of wines. The EU system incorporates older systems like AOC and DOC and adds new categories like PDO and PGI.\n\n5. **Cultural Impact and Global Influence**\n    - **Historical Context**: French wines, often from renowned estates and châteaux, have been exported globally since the 17th century, influencing wine production in regions including South Africa, the Americas, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n6. **Future Content**\n    - The document mentions that it will explore France's most important wine regions in subsequent sections, suggesting a detailed look at the significance and hierarchy of these regions, possibly evaluating areas like Bordeaux, Champagne, and Burgundy.\n\nThis document not only elucidates the regulatory landscape for wine labeling within the European Union but also emphasizes the global cultural influence and historical significance of wine production, particularly in France."

It explores the role of garnishes and the formulaic approach to cocktail making, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and balance. Below is the structured content from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Document Content\n\n#### 1. **Introduction to Cocktail Garnishes**\n   - **Purpose of Garnish**: Garnishes allow the drinker to adjust the cocktail to their liking. It can affect tartness levels and impart aroma, which is a crucial yet often overlooked component of balance.\n   - **Impact of Garnishes**: A lime wedge adds aroma and acidity which creates a greater impression of freshness. Citrus twists can suggest acidity without overpowering the drink's flavor.\n\n#### 2. **Cocktail Recipes Overview**\n   - **Common Formulas**: The document mentions that over four hundred recipes start with a basic template that gets modified slightly (like changing the type of glass or adding a different mixer) for variety.\n   - **Example Cocktails**: \n     - Fizz and tiki-style drinks are adjusted by glass type and mixers.\n     - Swizzles are usually poured over ice in a tall glass.\n     - Fundamental rules can often trace classic cocktails back to the origins like Manhattan or martini.\n\n#### 3. **Beyond Balance in Cocktails**\n   - **Approach to Creating New Cocktails**: The creation of new cocktails begins with identifying balanced drinks and adjusting them. The main focus should be on simplicity and finding the right combination of ingredients.\n   - **Philosophy**: Simplicity in cocktails often results in profound flavors, and when creating new drinks, one should intellectually assemble the cocktail's elements to understand why certain ingredients work well together.\n   - **Highlighted Cocktails**:\n     - **Gin Martini**: Suggested as the epitome of elegance in a cocktail.\n     - **Daiquiri**: Recommended for a refreshing experience.\n     - **Negroni**: Suggested as an ideal pre-meal drink.\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach helps in breaking down the essence and guidance provided in the document concerning the craft of cocktail making."

    "contenu": "# COMMON FRUITS OF TEMPERATE CLIMATES\n\n### Types of Apples:\n\n#### 1. Cider Apples\n- **Example**: European native *Malus sylvestris*\n- **Characteristics**: High-acid fruits rich in astringent tannins. These tannins help control the alcoholic fermentation and clarify the liquid.\n- **Uses**: Mainly used only in cider making.\n\n#### 2. Dessert or Eating Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Crisp and juicy with a pleasing balance between sour and sweet when eaten raw. They become relatively bland when cooked.\n- **Common in**: Supermarkets and produce markets as dessert apples.\n\n#### 3. Cooking Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Distinctly tart when raw and well-balanced when cooked. They maintain structure well when heated in pies or tarts. Some early \"codling\" varieties turn into a fluffy froth.\n- **Notable Varieties**: \n  - France: *Calville blanc d’hiver*\n  - England: *Bramley’s Seedling*\n  - Germany: *Glockenapfel*\n\n#### 4. Dual-purpose Apples\n- **Characteristics**: Adequate either raw or cooked; best when young and tart, mellows as it ages.\n- **Examples**: \n  - *Golden Delicious*\n  - *Granny Smith*\n\n### Cooking Potential of Apples:\n- Can be tested by wrapping a few slices in aluminum foil and baking at a hot oven for 15 minutes, or microwaving till the covering bloats.\n\n### Apple Flavor Development:\n- **Connoisseurship**: Noted by Edward Bunyard on the evolution of flavor post-harvest.\n- **Storage**: Best stored in a cool and dry place and inspected periodically to catch volatile ethers at their developmental peak.\n- **Aging**: Apples mellow with time because they consume some of their cell acid for energy.\n\n### Fruit Aroma Compounds: Esters\n\nMany fruits develop their aroma from esters, which are a combination of an acid and an alcohol. Here are some examples of ester aroma compounds in fruits:\n\n- Ethyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Ethyl acetate (common in apples)\n- Hexyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Hexyl acetate (common in pears)\n- Ethyl alcohol + Butyric acid = Ethyl butyrate (common in pineapple)\n- Isoamyl alcohol + Acetic acid = Isoamyl acetate (common in bananas)"
