    "contenu": "# VIN BRULÉ AND PANETTONE\n\nOn cold December mornings, there is nothing better than butter-slathered, toasted panettone, the large, cylindrical, Italian bread that is studded with candied fruits and raisins. With its church-dome-like, rounded top, panettone is traditional at Christmastime (and, come December, can be found in gourmet stores globally). Panettone is thought to have been created in Milan, in Lombardy, in the sixteenth century. The renowned bread is, in fact, now protected by a DOC for traditional Italian food products.\n\nNext door, in the Piedmont region of Italy, the bread is served in the late afternoon (or on Christmas Eve) with vin brulé (local dialect for “burnt wine”). Akin to English mulled wine, vin brulé is spiced and lightly sweetened wine, served steaming hot. To make it, the Italians combine a bottle of barbera or nebbiolo d'Alba with ¼ cup sugar, 2 cinnamon sticks, 4 pieces star anise, 2 cloves, several white peppercorns, and a couple of bay leaves. The mixture is heated almost to boiling, then put on very low heat and allowed to simmer for 30 minutes—whereupon it is drunk from mugs, with toasted panettone on the side.\n\n# FRANCIACORTA WINES\n\nFranciacortas are made as nonvintage wines as well as vintage-dated (known as Franciacorta millesimato). Rosé Franciacortas are also made, as well as a special category called Satèn (the word was chosen for its similarity to the English word satin). Satèn are sparklers with less carbon dioxide, and thus are slightly softer and less bubbly than traditional sparkling wines. Finally, like Champagne, Franciacorta sparklers spend quite a long time on the yeast lees—from 18 months for Franciacorta non-vintage to 60 months for Franciacorta Riserva.\n\n# LUGANA WINE REGION\n\nIn the same general area as Franciacorta, but farther east, near Lake Garda, is the small region of Lugana, where the dry white wine based on trebbiano di Lugana, considered one of the most tasty, aromatic types of trebbiano, is made. Although most trebbiano-based wines are innocuous, Lugana—especially Lugana Superiore—can be nicely refreshing. Some of its appeal may be related to the fact that it’s the wine usually served with the region’s other specialty: fresh trout from the impressive Lake Garda.\n\n# OLTREPÒ PAVESE REGION\n\nThe Oltrepò Pavese, known as the land of castles for the thirty-eight medieval fortresses that still stand imposingly across the landscape, is just a half hour’s drive from Milan, but this is where the major share of Lombardian wine is made. The large (33,000 acres/13,400 hectares), hilly area is south of northern Italy’s important Po River, hence the word Oltrepò (“on the other side of the Po”). Most of the wine here is of quaffing quality or just slightly better, based on a huge number of grape varieties. The reds, for example, are usually the product of barbera, cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, and/or Croatina, a simple, indigenous red. The humble whites are based on riesling italico (also known as welschriesling, a grape also grown in Austria and eastern Europe and not the same as true riesling), cortese, chardonnay, moscato, malvasia, and/or pinot grigio. Quite a bit of easy-drinking, well-priced spumante also comes from here, as well as a relatively new, higher-priced category of sparklers called Cruasé. A Cruasé is always a rosé made by the traditional method (secondary fermentation in the bottle) predominantly (85 percent) from pinot noir. Like Franciacorta, Cruasé is a DOCG. The name comes from cru—a worthy piece of ground—and rosé."

Here is the structured content based on the details in the image:\n\n### Cherry Pairings:\n1. **Cerise & Noisette**:\n   - Description: Pairing cherries with a handful of hazelnuts and a few dried sour cherries along with muesli and accompanied by a cigarette. The dried cherries bring a spicy flavor with strong notes of tobacco, and a clear tannic flavor of tea, complemented by the milky sweetness of hazelnuts.\n\n2. **Cerise & Noix**:\n   - Description: A partnership akin to the melancholic nature found in Alan Bennett’s writing. Walnut, overshadowed by other fruits like macadamia and pecan, gets a chance to shine with cherries. The recipe recommends making a cake with walnuts and cherries, enhanced by the sugars from cranberries.\n\n3. **Cerise & Noix de coco / Cerise & Pêche**:\n   - Description: These pairings suggest different combinations; one with coconut and another with peach, although the specifics are not detailed in the excerpt provided.\n\n4. **Cerise & Poisson fumé**:\n   - Description: Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall suggests a seasonal combination of smoked sea fish and cherry tart made with a compote of sour cherries. This is served with watercress salad and bread slices with nuts.\n\n5. **Cerise & Vanille**:\n   - Description: The pairing utilizes the prized Tahitian vanilla mixed with cherries, a combination heavily cherished since its creation by Escoffier in 1887 for Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. The dish involves cooking cherries in a thick and sweet sauce, where the cherries are poached and then served with a creme anglaise infused with the vanilla. This dish emphasizes a vanilla aroma, even if the vanilla used is more common.\n\n### Watermelon Description:\n- **General Note**:\n  - A description of cold watermelon resembling a mix of cherry and cucumber flavors, likened to a granita. Mentioned in Mark Twain’s \"The Tragedy of Pudd’nhead Wilson\" as a luxurious item. When eating watermelon, you shouldn’t expect any kind of discomfort or disagreement. Watermelon juice, being reddish and seedless, delivers a savory taste with a finish of vegetables, like carrot juice. Compatibility of watermelon with other ingredients is limited due to its watery nature, but its herby and acidic flavors mix well with other components.\n\nThis layout captures the essence of the original document, emphasizing both food pairings involving cherries and the cultural reflections on watermelon."

Suggests experimenting with walnut oil and tarragon vinegar salad dressing.\n\n3. **Nuts & Aubergine:**\n   - Description: Often paired in dishes with eggplants, zucchini, celery, and fennel, seasoned with aniseed. The Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli prefers to bake them with a mix of garlic, aubergine, ricotta, nutmeg, egg, and parmesan, advising to buy nuts with shells on for freshness during the winter months (December to February).\n\n4. **Nuts & Banana:**\n   - Idea: Suggests a unique presentation for bananas, peeling and cutting them into unblemished slices before sprinkling them with macerated walnuts and serving as a carpaccio, possibly paired with Mars bars for an added indulgence.\n\n5. **Nuts & Basil:**\n   - See _Basil & Nuts_ (not detailed in the document).\n\n6. **Nuts & Beetroot:**\n   - Description: Compare beetroots to weathered peasant faces and recommend pairing nut kernels with cooked beetroot slices and sweet potatoes in a red quinoa salad, seasoned with grilled nuts and either maple syrup or honey dressing.\n\n7. **Nuts & Beef:**\n   - See _Beef & Nuts_ (not detailed in the document).\n\n8. **Nuts & Broccoli:**\n   - Suggestion: Mix them in a pasta dish with sautéed broccoli to add a unique yet heart-healthy element to seafood dishes.\n\n9. **Nuts & Coffee:**\n   - See _Café & Nuts_ (not detailed in the document).\n\n10. **Nuts & Cinnamon:**\n    - Flavor Affinity: Described as having an autumnal affinity with cinnamon, caramel, and maple syrup, ideal for flavors similar to caramel candies.

Here are the key points structured:\n\n### Homemade Fermentation Methods\n- **Kefir and Yogurt**: These are the easiest sources for homemade starters.\n  - **Kefir**: Separates into curds and whey after two to three days of fermentation. The whey can be poured off carefully to prevent mixing.\n  - **Yogurt**: To process, lay a colander lined with cheesecloth over a bowl, put yogurt in, and let the whey drip out. The longer it hangs, the firmer the yogurt gets.\n\n### Use of Commercial Starters\n- **Experiment Example**: \n  - The author tried a commercial starter from Caldwell Bio-Fermentation Canada.\n  - Experiment involved fermenting cabbage with 1.8 percent salt; one half with the Caldwell starter and the other half without (spontaneous fermentation).\n  - Results indicated both methods were effective, though the Caldwell starter batch showed a faster decrease in pH but both batches reached food safety pH levels in less than 24 hours and had similar texture.\n\n### Criticism of Commercial Starters\n- The author is critical of commercial starters, seeing them generally unnecessary.\n- Criticism focuses on marketing techniques of commercial starters that play on fear and exaggerate the dangers of spontaneous fermentation.\n- Example given of Caldwell Bio-Fermentation stating spontaneous fermentations can be risky, which the author disputes.\n\nThe document highlights a practical approach to fermentation, balancing traditional methods with modern, commercial options while also critically analyzing the marketing and necessity of commercial products in fermentation practices."

Here's a structured summary of the key points raised in the document:\n\n1. **Concerns about Plastic Types**:\n   - The author highlights BPA (Bisphenol A) and phthalates, chemicals associated with certain plastics, expressing concerns about the chemicals migrating from HDPE (high-density polyethylene) into food.\n   - Specific concern is noted about using plastics for primary fermentation vessels due to the potential for chemical leaching.\n\n2. **Reuse of Plastic Bottles**:\n   - A significant concern is discussed regarding the reuse of number 1 plastic (PET) bottles, commonly used for water and soft drinks.\n     - The Environmental Health Perspectives study found that concentrations of phthalates in PET bottles can vary and leach into products with lower pH more readily than into bottled water.\n     - National Geographic’s Green Guide mentions that PET bottles are safe for a single use, but reusing them can lead to the leaching of chemicals.\n   \n3. **Personal Use and Practices**:\n   - The author mentions using 1- to 3-liter plastic soda bottles for carbonating partially fermented beverages. One plastic bottle is sometimes used alongside glass bottles to gauge carbonation by feeling the bottle’s rigidity, providing a physical indicator of the fermentation status.\n   - There's also a caution about the danger of unchecked carbonation leading to explosions, referencing a further discussion on \"Carbonation in chapter 6\".\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**:\n   - A balance is discussed between the risks of potential developmental problems in fetuses and infants from chemical exposure against the physical dangers of using glass bottles, which can explode.\n   - The choice of materials (plastic or glass) depends on personal circumstances, such as whether the individual is pregnant or caring for an infant, where practical considerations may dictate the choice.\n\nThis document highlights the author's cautious approach to using plastics in food-related processes, concern for chemical exposure, and the practical considerations necessary when choosing storage materials."

Below is the structured content transformed from the text in the image:\n\n---\n\n### Gravy Preparation\n\n- Gravies are made by deglazing cooking liquids with flour, followed by cooking until raw flour aroma dissipates.\n- Commonly, 1-2 tablespoons (10-20 grams) of flour per cup (250 ml) of deglazing liquid is used.\n- The gravies are thickened by cooking until the mixture achieves the desired consistency.\n- These sauces are typically made just before serving and have a slightly coarse texture even when lump-free due to their preparation method.\n\n### Thickening with Starch and Plant Particles\n\n#### Starch-Based Sauces\n- Starch granules are initially heated in a fraction of the deglazing liquid, allowing them to gather and crowd together.\n- The paste formed is then broken down into finer pieces and mixed back with the remaining liquid, resulting in a smooth consistency.\n\n#### Plant Particles\n- Sauces that incorporate plant particles tend to separate into solid particles and thin fluid.\n- These particles comprise clumps of carbohydrate and protein molecules that do not disperse as uniformly as starch, thus providing less effective thickening compared to finely dispersed starch molecules.\n- Plant-cell fragments used as thickeners can be less than 1 millimeter in size, creating a grainy texture and less efficiency in thickening.\n\n### Purees\n- Purees are made by crushing fruits or vegetables, breaking down cell walls and releasing the juices.\n- The document explains the origin of the term \"puree,\" derived from the Latin word \"purus\" meaning pure, which reflects the process of creating a fine, consistent mush by purifying the plant material.\n- The term also extends to certain cooking methods, like draining cooked legumes to achieve a desired consistency.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe extract talks about culinary methods for preparing different types of sauces and purees, illustrating the science of thickening agents and the impact of physical characteristics of the ingredients on sauce texture and consistency."

Even though high-tannin wines literally “dry out” the mouth, we don’t call them dry wines. Instead, that term is reserved to describe the absence of sweetness in wine. So we’re left groping for other words to describe tannin’s drying effects. We might describe a juicy Shiraz or other wine with mild tannin as “soft,” “velvety,” or “plush.” Wines with stronger tannin might be called “firm” or “structured,” or in extreme cases even overtly “tannic” or “tight,” as with young Cabernet Sauvignon. In a strangely appropriate metaphor, tannin character may be referred to as “grip,” and sometimes it really does feel like the wine has taken hold of the flesh in your mouth and won't let go.\n\n**Footer:**\n68 WINE SECRETS"

Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Vinification of a Dry Sparkling Rosé in VSIG (Vin Sans Indication Géographique)**:\n   - The document explains that the process of making rosé wine is similar to white wine. It involves a delicate fermentation called \"Optiflore\", but does not elaborate much on it.\n   - The grape juice is fermented in tanks with controlled levels of free and total sulfur dioxide. The yeast Zymlafore VL1 is used at a concentration of 25 g/hL to assist in a vigorous fermentation kept at a strict temperature of 37°C.\n   - It emphasizes the importance of the double volume of yeast preparation compared to the sugars and mentions rhythmic additions of yeast and nutrients every 20 minutes.\n   - Post the initial phase, more lees (dead yeast) are added to facilitate a complex interaction for a smooth fermentation. A significant aspect discussed is the cessation of fermentation at 10.5 g/L residual sugar at a temperature of 10°C, which crucially defines the mouthfeel and effervescence of the wine.\n   - The pressure in the bottle is controlled to about 4 bar at 20°C with a total SO2 at 4.5 g/L. The wine is then sent to a bottler secured with no entrained enologist or agitators.\n\n2. **Post-Fermentation Handling**:\n   - The document discusses the steps after fermentation like the need for pulling the wine off the lees and refining the liquid. Filtration occurs in several stages using methods like earth (soil) filtration.\n   - It is detailed how certain yeasts are responsible for the decrease in oxygenation and help resume fermentation at 18°C after bottling, determining the final amount of sugar in wine which should be below 4 g/L.\n\n3. **Follow-up of Fermentation Kinetics**:\n   - This section addresses monitoring the continued fermentation post-bottling.\n   - A crucial factor is the ideal fermentation temperature for whites mentioned as 18°C, indicating differences might be expected with added Saccharomyces or in different climatic conditions.\n   - It discloses ideal conditions and interventions like immersion in water baths to manage the slow or fast fermenting conditions due to climatic impacts.\n   - Figures 37 to 39 seem to illustrate the progress and outcomes of fermentation stages from previous batches.\n\nThe document appears to be taken from a scientific publication, thesis, or detailed study given the terminology and references to specific methodologies and conditions which are typical in such documents. The text is detailed about the procedure but does not provide full context or framework which might be found earlier or later in the original source."

Here is a structured analysis of the text:\n\n---\n\n**Main points discussed in the document:**\n\n1. **Winter Activities at Wineries:**\n   After the harvest, wineries spend the winter months analyzing and tasting different lots of wine to make preliminary blends, which involves considerable effort and attention.\n\n2. **Residual Sugar Content in Wine:**\n   - Colas typically have about 11 percent residual sugar.\n   - Typical dinner wines have 0 to perhaps 2 percent residual sugar.\n   - Legally, for a wine to be labeled as a sweet wine in Europe, it must have at least 4.5 percent residual sugar.\n   - Port wine generally contains around 8 percent residual sugar.\n   - Sauternes have 10 to 15 percent.\n   - German Trockenbeerenauslesen can have as much as 30 percent.\n   - Pedro Ximénez wines might have over 40 percent residual sugar.\n\n3. **Role of Sweetness in Wine:**\n   There are specific styles of wine where a slight sweetness is essential to balance the acidity, such as in Champagne, German rieslings, and French Vouvray wines. The sweetness in these wines helps counterbalance their high acidity. An analogy similar to adding a quarter teaspoon of sugar to a bitter espresso is provided to illustrate how small amounts of sweetness affect the balance and perception of the beverage.\n\n4. **Purpose of Sweetness:**\n   Sweetness in wine can either serve as a primary characteristic in dessert wines or act as a subtle counterbalance to enhance cohesion and harmony in the wine’s flavor profile.\n\n---\n\nThis summary captures the key teachings regarding the roles and regulation of residual sugar in wines, illustrating how sweetness can either define a wine type or adjust its flavor dynamics."

    "contenu": "**Title: PRESERVED MEATS**\n\n---\n\n**Fermented Sausages**\n- Fermented sausages develop a dense, chewy texture thanks to:\n  - Salt extraction of meat proteins.\n  - Denaturation by bacterial acids.\n  - General drying of the meat mass.\n  - The flavor originates from bacterial acids and volatile molecules, and from fragments of protein and fat generated by enzymes from both the microbes and the meat.\n\n---\n\n**Confits**\n- Historical background:\n  - Originated from central Asia to Western Europe.\n  - Technique involved burying meat in a thick layer of fat.\n  - The southwest French version known as \"confit\" of goose and duck legs became fashionable in the 19th century.\n  \n- Method:\n  - Preservation involves cramming geese to get fat for unseasonable meat preservation.\n  - Traditionally used for preserving pork in its own lard after slaughter.\n  - Became popular in Bayonne in the 18th century due to economical maize production.\n\n- Modern practices:\n  - Meat is salted, seasoned with herbs and spices, and slowly heated.\n  - Typically stored in a cool, sealed, and sporadic-reheat environment to extend its life.\n  - Contains precautions against botulism including maintaining low storage temperatures (below 40°F/4°C) and using nitrate or nitrite in the salt.\n  \n- Usage:\n  - Confit is now made to be consumed within a few days and is often salted mildly for flavor rather than long-term preservation.\n\n---\n\n**Food Words: Confit**\n- Usage of the term:\n  - Loosely used to describe food cooked slowly and stored in fat, achieving a tender consistency.\n  - Origins from the French verb \"confire\" (to do, to produce) and the Latin \"conficere\".\n  - Initially applied to fruit preserved in sugar or honey, and later to vegetables in vinegar and meats in fat.\n  \n- Modern interpretation:\n  - Focuses on flavor and texture development in foods through slow cooking methods.\n  - The idea of long-term preservation has faded, making way for quicker, flavor-oriented cooking methods."

    "contenu": "The document provided offers a historical overview of the sugar industry and its related practices, including the cultural and economic implications of sugar production and consumption. The document details specific sections:\n\n1. **Historical Background**:\n   - It discusses the spread and establishment of sugar production by the Spanish and Portuguese in the Caribbean islands and parts of Western Africa, Brazil, and Mexico starting around 1550. The involvement of English, French, and Dutch colonists in sugar production is also mentioned.\n   - The document highlights the link between the sugar industry and slavery, mentioning that by 1700, around 10,000 Africans were being traded yearly to the Americas via the Portuguese colony São Tomé to work predominantly in sugar plantations. It mentions that two-thirds of the 20 million Africans enslaved in the Americas were employed in sugar plantations.\n\n2. **Economic and Technological Developments**:\n   - It elaborates on the role of sugar in bolstering the economies of minor port cities like Bristol and Liverpool in England and Newport in Rhode Island through the intricate trade in sugar, slaves, rum, and manufactured goods.\n   - The document states that the fortunes made by plantation owners were significant to the early stages of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n3. **Decline and Changes in the 18th Century**:\n   - The document describes a decline in the West Indian sugar industry during the 18th century, despite its strong beginnings. It attributes the decline to the abolitionist movements, especially in Britain, which impacted the slave-driven sugar economies.\n\n4. **Introduction of Beet Sugar**:\n   - The text covers the introduction of beet sugar as an alternative to cane sugar. In 1747, Andreas Marggraf, a Prussian chemist, demonstrated that sugar derived from beets was chemically identical to cane sugar. This development, according to the document, could foresee the large-scale production of beet sugar in climates more temperate than those traditionally suitable for cane sugar.\n\n5. **Stages of Sugar Cooking in the 17th Century**:\n   - The document describes various stages of sugar cooking that were recognized by the consistency and reactions of the boiling sugar syrup, as understood from the 17th-century French confectionery practices outlined in \"Le Confiseur français\". These stages include:\n     - **Ribbon**: Syrup begins to thicken, doesn’t flow when tested between finger and thumb.\n     - **Pearl**: Achieved when syrup forms a small thread when fingers are opened.\n     - **Feather**: Identified by syrup flinging away like dry feathers when shook in the air.\n     - **Burning Smell**: Recognized when the sugar syrup cools in water without sticking, used for making hard confections like caramel.\n\nThis historical perspective not only provides insights into the economic and cultural ramifications of sugar cultivation and its trade but also emphasizes the technological and scientific advancements in confectionery methods during the era."

Répartissez-les sur la plaque, en une seule couche.\n   - Mélangez dans un bol l'huile d'olive, la fleur de sel, l'origan et le piment.\n   - Versez cette préparation en filet sur les pitas découpées et imprégnez-les en mélangeant avec vos mains.\n   - Enfournez pour 5 à 8 minutes, en les remuant 1 fois et en surveillant attentivement pour cuisson jusqu'à ce que les chips soient dorés et croustillants. Réservez.\n\n3. **Pour le muhammara:**\n   - Lavez les poivrons et faites-les griller sous le grill du four jusqu'à ce que leur peau soit noircie et leur chair tendre. Placez-les dans un saladier, couvrez-les 15 minutes puis pelez-les et ôtez leurs graines. Faites griller dans une poêle sèche les grains de cumin. Pelez et dégermez l'ail.\n   - Mixez ensuite les poivrons avec l'ail, les noix, la chapelure, la mélasse de grenade, le jus de citron, l'huile d'olive, le sel, les épices. Goûtez et si nécessaire ajoutez en sel et en poivre.\n   - Si la texture vous semble trop épaisse, ajustez un peu de jus de citron ou d'huile d'olive. Placez 1 heure au réfrigérateur avant de déguster avec les chips de pita.\n\n### Conseil du chef\n- La muhammara est encore plus délicieuse lorsque les poivrons sont grillés au barbecue. Si vous en avez la possibilité, n'hésitez pas. Pour rendre le goût délicieusement fumé de cette préparation, utilisez du sel fumé (sel fumé d'Anglesey ou sel de Maldon) ou du pimenton de la Vera.\n\n### Bon à savoir\n- Originaire de Syrie, la muhammara a été largement adoptée au Moyen-Orient. On la retrouve sous différentes formes au Liban et en Turquie, sous le nom d'acuka.\n\n### Renvois techniques\n- Préparer l'ail, p. 29\n- Cuire des poivrons, p. 45\n```"
