As of 2013, industry analysts estimated that as much as 50 percent of the foreign wine sold in China may have been fake. Certain individuals among a small army of Chinese bottle scavengers (aka “professional bottle recyclers”) have been known to pay over $300 for a single empty bottle of Château Lafite-Rothschild or Château Pétrus. After their tasting events, auction houses in China now routinely smash empty bottles with a hammer, to prevent the bottles from ending up on the black market and being refilled with cheap wine or worse, a concoction of citric acid, flavoring essence, and food coloring. Of course, skillful counterfeiters have also taken another tack. Instead of using authentic bottles with real labels, many have simply bought facsimile bottles and then replicated the labels of great estates, dispersing the fakes among genuine bottles in wine shops all over Asia.\n\n#### Caption:\nGansu Province, on the ancient “Silk Road” of central China, has a small number of wineries, though the rugged terrain and hot climate present challenges.\n\n---\n\n### INNER MONGOLIA\n\nInner Mongolia has a long history of raisin production and winemaking, especially in the area near Wuhai. The days during the short growing season are hot; the nights, cold. Sunlight is intense and humidity is low. So far so good. But the extremely cold, snowless winter means that the ground freezes hard and deep. As a result, much of the leading research on winter-hardy grape varieties and cold-climate viticultural techniques like deep-ditch cultivation have happened here. As is easily imagined, researchers in Inner Mongolia are also at the forefront of developing new, extremely cold-tolerant hybrids, especially of grapes belonging to the species Vitis vinifera and Vitis amurensis (thus far, the resulting grape varieties have been given names like Red Wine Grape #1 and Inner Mongolia #1). There also exists here a fascinating Vitis vinifera variety called Tuo Xian, thought to be one of the most cold-tolerant vinifera varieties in existence. Its pink berries and huge, foot-long clusters are amazing, but the wine from these grapes is rather basic."

THE SWISS DRINK AN AVERAGE OF 12 GALLONS (47 LITERS) OF WINE PER PERSON PER YEAR.**\n\nSwitzerland is surrounded on all sides by some of Europe’s most prominent wine-producing countries, and although its wines are not nearly as renowned (or numerous), they are worthy of attention. To begin with, much of this small Alpine country (one-tenth the size of California) is just simply too high, and therefore too cold, for grapevines to grow successfully. Switzerland ranks seventeenth in the world in volume of wine production, just after Hungary and Canada. Most of its wines come from the western, predominantly French-speaking part of the country, and especially from the important provinces, or cantons, as they are known in Switzerland, of Valais, Vaud, Neuchâtel, and Geneva. Wine is also made, however, in the southern, Italian-speaking area known as Ticino, and in the more eastern, German-speaking Ostschweiz.\n\nSwitzerland (somewhat counterintuitively, given its climate) is mostly a red wine producing country. The leading variety, in fact, is pinot noir, called blauburgunder, a light, spicy, and often quite good wine, although rarely complex or nuanced in flavor. Some tasty, light red wines are also made from pinot noir-gamay blends, which are called Dôle. In the southern canton of Ticino, merlot has been growing since the early part of the twentieth century, and again, the wines are light, sleek, fairly crisp, and sometimes spicy. But perhaps the most intriguing red variety of all in Switzerland is the indigenous rouge du pays (incorrectly called cornalin locally), which can be the source of super-juicy, spicy wines redolent of black cherries and pomegranates."

The author describes their personal experience wherein they have observed others consuming high meat. While the author has reservations about its safety and appeal, they note that those who consume it often report feeling healthy and attribute their wellbeing to this practice.

This section highlights the problem of sourcing meat and fish, describing most conventional practices in the industry as gruesome.\n  - The author advocates for buying meat from small farmers who practice sustainable, healthy, and ethical farming. They recognize that although these practices are more expensive and demand more land per animal, they are more ethical and sustainable. The author encourages readers to support such practices.\n\nThe text appears to be part of a larger work, potentially a book or an article discussing food practices with a focus on health and ethics."

    "contenu": "### Serving Burgundy—A Few Special Considerations\n\nServing a great Burgundy, whether white or red, in too small a glass is seen as a mistake. Burgundy wines are best appreciated in generous glasses with a design that narrows at the top. This allows the full impact and complexity of the wine's aroma to be experienced.\n\nIt's also important to understand that Burgundies change significantly after being poured. Even after just a few sips, the wine can evolve, revealing new flavors and aromas. This ongoing transformation in the glass contributes to the intellectual pleasure of drinking Burgundy.\n\nFor red Burgundy, especially made from the pinot noir grape, it's suggested not to open the bottle too long before serving or to decant it. Pinot noir is delicate; too much exposure to air can cause its flavors to diminish quickly. It's recommended to drink red Burgundy soon after opening, straight from the bottle.\n\n#### Wine Characteristics in Burgundy\n\nEach village in the Côte d'Or region of Burgundy is renowned for wines with distinctive characters:\n\n- **Chambolle-Musigny** wines are known for their elegance.\n- **Nuits-St.-Georges** produces more structured pinot noirs.\n  \nAmong the red wines from Côte de Nuits, villages like Gevrey-Chambertin, Flagey-Echézeaux, Vosne-Romanée, Nuits-St.-Georges are highly regarded for their robust and structured wines, often infused with complex flavors. By contrast, the Côte de Beaune is known for producing softer and more lush red wines.\n\nBurgundies from all across the Côte d’Or are celebrated for their deep, earthy flavors, often enriched with minerals, spices, licorice, or truffles. These are also considered the most aromatic and long-lasting on the palate, though they are usually lighter in color.\n\nIn summary, a Burgundy's glass, timing of decanting, and understanding of regional characteristics are key in enjoying these sophisticated wines to their fullest."

    "contenu": "The document discusses Cabernet Franc's historical and contemporary adaptation to cooler climates, focusing on regions such as the Loire Valley, Bordeaux, and New York State. It highlights the grape variety's ability to thrive in such environments due to its late ripening, which reduces the risk of frost damage. This adaptation has been shown in the increase of plantings in warmer areas like California's Napa and Sonoma valleys. The character of the grape changes in cooler climates, showing distinct dark and rich flavors.\n\nAdditionally, the document elaborates on New York's production of sweet wines like ice wines and late harvest wines influenced by traditional German styles, all thanks to locally grown vinifera grapes that manage to survive and produce even in colder conditions.\n\nA significant part of New York's viticultural success is credited to two European immigrants: Charles Fournier and Dr. Konstantin Frank. Fournier, previously with Veuve Clicquot in France, later joined New York’s Gold Seal Wine Company and hired Frank who introduced the growing of vitis vinifera varieties by leveraging sophisticated viticultural techniques. This started what was mentioned as a vinifera revolution in New York's wine industry in the 1950s. Frank's ability to cultivate diverse European varietals led to the production of wines from grapes that were previously considered impossible to grow in New York, such as rkatsiteli. \n\nThis narrative showcases the evolution, adaptation, and innovation within the wine industry, particularly through the introduction and success of traditional European grape varieties in New York State."

The climate is moderated by the Pacific Ocean and protected from extreme conditions by the Coastal Range (a mountain range inland from the coast).\n- The geographic positioning of Chile’s vineyards, flipped into the northern hemisphere, would correlate roughly to the latitudes of North Africa or southern Spain. However, the Humboldt Current impacts the region by providing cold Antarctic waters, helping to keep temperatures relatively mild, even in the warmest seasons.\n- Noted for rarely exceeding 90°F (32°C) during the day and having cool nights, the Casablanca Valley, despite being one of the warmest regions, can still be quite cool, necessitating the use of fleece vests during harvest time.\n\n### Highlighted Section\n**THE MOST IMPORTANT CHILEAN WINES**\n\n#### LEADING WINES\n- CABERNET SAUVIGNON red\n- CARMENÈRE red\n- CHARDONNAY white\n- MERLOT red\n- SAUVIGNON BLANC white\n\n#### WINE OF NOTE\n- SAUVIGNON VERT white\n\n### Additional Information\n- Chile houses approximately 506,000 acres (204,800 hectares) of vineyards and over 200 wineries. \n  - *Denominaciones de Origen* (DOs): Atacama, Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Valle Central (Central Valley), and Southern Regions. \n  - Primarily noted DOs: Aconcagua and Valle Central, housing most of Chile’s historic wine centers and a significant portion of exports.\n- The Aconcagua region includes particularly warm areas and the coastal, cooler districts like Casablanca Valley and San Antonio Valley, gaining prominence for viticulture, especially for Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, post the 1990s investment surge."

    "contenu": "The provided document discusses various aspects and techniques related to the fermentation and post-fermentation processes in winemaking:\n\n1. **Pumping Over Technique:**\n   - A technique called \"pumping over\" is used to enhance the interaction between the juice and the thick mantle of skins in the fermentation tank. This involves moving juice from the bottom of the tank to the top, where it is sprayed over the cap of skins to infuse the wine with color, tannin, aroma, and flavor.\n\n2. **Temperature Management During Fermentation:**\n   - The temperature of the must (juice, skins, and seeds mixture) during fermentation should ideally be between 60°F (16°C) and 85°F (29°C). Exceeding 85°F can lead to the volatilization or burning off of delicate aromas and flavors of the wine.\n\n3. **Alcohol Formation and Yeast Activity:**\n   - Through fermentation, most of the sugar in the grape juice is converted into alcohol, typically resulting in a wine with an alcohol content between 10 to 16 percent. Yeasts responsible for fermentation die at about 16.5 percent alcohol due to being poisoned by the alcohol they produce.\n\n4. **Transformation Through Malolactic Fermentation:**\n   - Following alcoholic fermentation, all red wines undergo a process called malolactic fermentation, which is crucial for a wine’s softness and microbial stability. This process is particularly significant for understanding red wines and is generally explained as making wines softer and more stable.\n\n5. **Post-Fermentation Maceration:**\n   - After fermentation, a decision must be made whether to drain the wine off the skins immediately or let it sit with the skins for an extended period. This extended maceration allows for more extraction of color, tannin, aroma, and flavor but needs to be managed carefully to avoid over-extraction, which can result in a wine that is overly tannic and bitter.\n\nThe document suggests careful management of these processes to ensure the production of high-quality wine, emphasizing that different stages and techniques have significant impacts on the final characteristics of the wine."

    "contenu": "The document discusses how humans perceive and communicate about the flavor and aroma of wine, emphasizing that much of what we interpret as \"flavor\" is actually derived from smell rather than taste.\n\n### Main Points:\n\n1. **Flavor Perception and Smell**\n   - Flavor is often thought to be mostly about taste, but it is primarily influenced by smell.\n   - When wine or food is consumed, volatile aroma compounds are inhaled through the nose reaching the olfactory region, enhancing the perception of flavors more significantly than through taste buds alone.\n\n2. **Flavor vs. Aroma Perception**\n   - Tasting wine involves aromatic compounds entering the nasal cavity, intensifying the sensory experience beyond just taste.\n   - The act of tasting food or wine releases aroma compounds that travel through the mouth to the olfactory region at the back of the nose, where they are perceived as more intense due to their proximity to the sensory receptors and warming from body heat.\n\n3. **Challenges with Describing Aromas**\n   - Describing tastes (sweet, dry) and tactile sensations (warm, cold, light, heavy) is relatively straightforward compared to describing aromas.\n   - Aromas are more subjective and complex, making them harder to describe. This difficulty is due to encountering numerous volatile compounds that interact in unique ways, unlike primary colors which are more straightforward for descriptions.\n\n4. **Examples of Wine Aromas**\n   - Distinctive aromas can be associated with certain wines, such as the bell pepper aroma found in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines.\n   - More complex aromas, like the combination of vanilla, cinnamon, and wintergreen suggesting a bubblegum smell, arise from multiple compounds interacting.\n\nThis detailed explanation in the document highlights the complexities involved in accurately communicating the flavor characteristics of wine, demonstrating the intricate relationship between taste and smell in flavor perception."

On the coldest days, you’ll want to warm your home as well as your body with slow-braised dishes, soups, and stews, and on warmer days, you’ll want to keep your home (and yourself) cooler by doing more grilling or on the hottest days serving quick-cooked or even chilled dishes — no matter what season those days may fall in.\n\nSome cooks believe you can serve anything at any time of the year. Our eyebrows have raised upon seeing heavy braised dishes on restaurant menus in August. However, chefs have defended them by arguing that once someone is seated in an air-conditioned dining room, they forget what it’s like outside! Those chefs may be giving customers what they want while they are at the table.\n\nBut what happens when those same customers leave the restaurant after finishing their braised short ribs and walk out into the heat and humidity? They might feel as out of sorts as they would wearing long wool overcoats on such a night! A lighter meal on a hot night won’t sap your energy in the same way. Even in the middle of summer, there will be unseasonably cool days that might suggest a warm dish that would offend the sensibilities on the season’s hottest, most sweltering day. Even during the dead of winter, the sun can break through and create an unseasonably warm day on which hot, slow-cooked braised dishes would not be appealing.\n\nConsidering the weather means taking into consideration the natural rhythms of nature. One of the easiest clues available to inform your cooking is to look out the window, and ask yourself what you feel like eating. If you look out the window on a sunny summer morning, are you more tempted by hot oatmeal — or by granola and yogurt? That afternoon, as the temperature rises, does your mouth water thinking of hot tomato soup — or chilled gazpacho? That night, does the temperature fall enough to make you want to turn on the oven to roast a chicken — or would you rather grill it on your stovetop?\n\nOn our first visit to a certain New York City restaurant on one of the hottest nights of summer, we were surprised to be sent an amuse-bouche from the kitchen that was a tall glass of hot yellow pepper soup. While the soup itself might have been made from seasonal ingredients and tasty in a vacuum, unfortunately what we remember even more vividly was how unappealing we found it, especially as our first taste after a sweltering taxi ride to the restaurant. If the same soup had been served to us cold, we expect it would have been more successful as the welcoming gesture it was intended to be."

Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n## Ice-Shaping Tools\n\n### Ice Picks\n- **Purpose:** For breaking and shaping larger pieces of ice.\n- **Usage:** Ice picks are used occasionally at Death & Co to shape or break apart pieces of 2-inch block ice. While an ice pick might be handy for shaping your own ice at home, it's noted that cheap ice picks with long, straight spikes are more dangerous than useful for extensive ice carving duties.\n- **Recommendation:** Opt for a shorter spike and an avoid-shaped end for delicate carving duties.\n\n### Serrated Knives\n- **Purpose:** For breaking down large blocks of ice.\n- **Description:** When breaking down a giant block of ice into cubes, a long, serrated kitchen knife is recommended. The teeth on these knives function similarly to many ice picks.\n- **Characteristic:** The knife should have a curved cutting edge and deep teeth, making it easier and more efficient for sawing and chipping away at ice blocks than a straight-edged bread knife. \n- **Economic Advice:** It’s advisable not to spend much money on an expensive knife as the wear from cutting ice rapidly dulls the blades. An inexpensive restaurant supply model is preferred.\n\n### Wood Chisels\n- This entry is listed but not discussed in the portion of the document provided.\n\nAdditional Description:\n- The text mentions that a good speed pourer should have a \"long, slightly angled metal spout with a plastic collar that fits tightly inside the neck of the bottle to prevent leaks.\" It is suggested to avoid models with short, plastic spouts and those with hinged lids at the top, as they can make the liquid spray uncontrollably.\n\n--- \n\nThe document serves as a guide for selecting appropriate tools for handling and shaping ice efficiently and safely in culinary or bar environments."

    "contenu": "The text discusses the distribution and cultivation of the Sangiovese grape variety, specifically mentioning its presence in Argentina and California, as well as its Italian roots.\n\n### Document Analysis:\n\n**Geographic Mention:**\n- **Argentina:** The Sangiovese vine found in Argentina primarily in Mendoza is appreciated by Argentine consumers but is less exported due to a differing palate profile that many global wine consumers expect from this grape. The varietal has a strong Italian heritage here.\n- **California, USA:** In the past two decades, Sangiovese has also made a presence particularly in Napa and Sonoma counties. Despite a surge in plantings and varying vinification methods akin to Tuscan models, the grape still constitutes a minor fraction of vineyard plantings in California and other states like Washington.\n\n**Cultivation Insights:**\n- **Planting and Maturation:** The vines in California seem to have a long history, with many vintners of Italian ancestry. Yet, the majority of the Californian Sangiovese plantings are relatively new and need time to mature. Different aging and blending methods are experimented with, invoking Tuscany-inspired practices.\n\n**Wine Characteristics and Choices:**\n- In-depth choices and complex decisions define the vinification of Sangiovese, with factors including:\n  - **Selections and Clones:** Many clones of Sangiovese contribute significantly to the flavor and quality of the wine.\n  - **Barrel Choices:** Choices between aged wood or no wood impact the aging process.\n  - **Blending Practices:** Decisions on whether the grape is used in blended or pure form.\n\n**Expert Opinion:**\n- **Ezio Rivella,** an Italian oenologist, noted the numerous official and unofficial selections of Sangiovese planted in Italy, predominantly in Tuscany. These clones have distinct and unique characteristics, providing nuanced outcomes depending on the cultivation practices and regional variations.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Matching Italian Sangiovese clones with optimal sites overseas remains a significant challenge, contributing to the diverse outcomes and adaptability issues of this grape beyond its native land.\n\n**Note:**\n- A detailed table of wine-growing regions for Sangiovese is mentioned to appear on page 282 of this document."
