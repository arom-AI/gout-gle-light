For biological ageing\n  2. For oxidative ageing\n- Selection based on wine characteristics and the wines' \"flor\" development during ageing.\n\n#### Fortification and Sobretabla\n- After classification:\n  1. Base wines fortified to 96% abv.\n  2. Stored for a few months known as sobretabla.\n\n#### Wines for Biological Ageing\n- These wines require specific handling to develop flor.\n- **Important**: Need to wait and see how the flor develops.\n\n### In the Winery (Naturally Sweet Styles)\n#### Grape Handling\n- Grapes are sun-dried to concentrate sugar levels.\n- This method develops raisin flavors.\n- More on this technique in \"Sweet Winemaking\" in Chapter 8.\n\n#### Fermentation and Fortification\n- Grapes reach desired must weight.\n- Yeast struggles due to high sugar content.\n- Fermentation naturally stalls around a few degrees of alcohol until it stops.\n- Must fortified to 17% abv.\n\n### Maturation in the Solera System\n- **Barrels**: 600-litre oak barrels, system called soleras.\n- **Method**: Uses a fractional blending system with multiple stages or \"criaderas\".\n- **Process**:\n  1. Wine bottled from the final level called solera.\n  2. Each butt in this level replenished from a butt in the level above, each containing slightly younger wine.\n  3. This cycle helps maintain consistent wine character across vintages.\n\n#### Environmental Controls\n- **Location**: Jerez with traditional bodegas.\n- **Design**: Thick whitewashed walls, high ceilings, and windows that point towards cooling poniente winds.\n- **Climate Control**: Modern facilities are now air-conditioned, to maintain required humidity and temperature.\n\n### Glossary\n- **Flor**: A film of yeast known as flor is crucial in the biological ageing of sherry.\n- **Sobretabla**: After fortification, wines are left to settle and integrate for a few months in sobretabla.\n- **Solera System**: A traditional method used for ageing sherry in a system of fractional blending."

Wine production in this area dates back to at least the thirteenth century, with references to \"Chianti wine\" originating from the \"Chianti Mountains\" near Florence. There’s an interesting note suggesting that the earliest Chianti wines might have been white.\n\n**Environmental Influence**\n\nThe beauty of the Chianti region is undeniable, featuring hillsides adorned with olive groves, cypresses, and ancient structures such as castles and stone farmhouses. This picturesque landscape has historically been a source of inspiration for artists and poets, drawn to the area’s soft natural light and serene environment.\n\n**Chianti and Chianti Classico**\n\nThere’s often confusion between Chianti and Chianti Classico wines. While they may seem similar, Chianti Classico is considered a \"top level\" of Chianti wine, distinguished by its specific Denomination of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin (DOCG). The regulations for creating these wines are stringent; for instance, it is not permissible to produce Chianti Classico outside of its designated region and vice versa for regular Chianti.\n\n**Cultural Legacy**\n\nThe document includes a nostalgic image of old-style Chianti fiaschi (flask-like bottles), which evoke memories of a former era, highlighting the deep cultural heritage and traditional practices in winemaking in the region.\n\n---\n\nThis analysis captures the essence of the document, focusing on the geographical distinction, historical context, and the regulatory distinctions between Chianti and Chianti Classico wines."

It highlights the lengthy aging process of Rioja wines, both red and white, which are considered quintessential examples of traditionally styled Rioja wines.\n\nKey points from the document include:\n\n1. **Aging Process**:\n   - Traditional Riojan winemakers utilize significant wood aging, with the region's reds often aged for three to six years, much shorter than the historical fifteen to twenty years or more. In a notable example, Marqués de Murrieta aged their 1942 gran reserva until 1983, a total of 41 years.\n\n2. **Barrel Inventory**:\n   - The region reportedly has over 1.3 million barrels, with many bodegas owning ten thousand or more barrels.\n  \n3. **Pricing and Value**:\n   - Long-aged gran reservas from Rioja are considered some of the best deals in the wine world, offering complex flavors after a decade or more of aging at reasonable prices. However, caution is advised against recent, cheaper Riojas entering the market, often described as crianzas, which may not meet quality expectations.\n\n4. **Designation and Standards**:\n   - Rioja was the first region in Spain to be awarded the DOCa (Denominación de Origen Calificada) status in 1991, requiring that the region meet the highest standards in its winemaking and viticultural practices.\n\nThe document aims to inform about the traditional and evolving practices in Rioja's winemaking, emphasizing the unique aging process and the quality associated with Rioja wines. It serves as an educational piece for those interested in the regional wine industry's intricacies and appeals to those who appreciate aged wines."

    "contenu": "**FLAVORINGS FROM PLANTS**\n\n**Keeping and Brewing Tea**\nWell-made tea is fairly stable and can be stored for several months in an airtight container that is kept cool and dark. Tea quality does eventually deteriorate thanks to the effects of oxygen and some residual enzyme activity; aroma and briskness are lost, and the color of black tea infusions becomes less orange-red, more dull brown.\n\nTeas are brewed in various ways in different parts of the world. In the West, a relatively small quantity of black tea leaves—a teaspoon per 6-oz cup/2–5 gm per 180 ml—is brewed once, for several minutes, then discarded. In Asia, a larger quantity of leaves of any tea—as much as a third the volume of the pot—is first rinsed with hot water, then infused briefly several times, with the second and third infusions offering more delicate, subtle flavor balances. The infusion time ranges from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, and depends on two factors. One is leaf size; small particles and their great surface area require less time for their contents to be extracted. The other is water temperature, which in turn varies depending on the kind of tea being brewed. Both oolong and black teas are infused in water close to the boil, and relatively briefly. Green tea is infused longer in much cooler water, 160–170°F/70–45°C, which limits extraction of its still abundant bitter and astringent phenolics, and minimizes damage to its chlorophyll pigment.\n\nIn a typical 3–5 minute infusion of black tea, about 40% of the leaf solids are extracted into the water. Caffeine is rapidly extracted, more than three quarters of the total in the first 30 seconds, while the larger phenolic complexes come out much more slowly.\n\n**Serving Tea**\nOnce tea is properly brewed, the liquid should be separated from the leaves immediately; otherwise extraction continues and the tea gets harsh. All kinds of tea are best drunk fresh; as they stand, their aroma dissipates, and their phenolic components react with dissolved oxygen and each other, changing the color and taste.\n\nTea is sometimes mixed with milk. When it is, the phenolic compounds immediately bind to the milk proteins, become unavailable to bind to our mouth surfaces and salivary proteins, and the taste becomes much less astringent. It’s best to add hot tea to warm milk, rather than vice versa; that way the milk is heated gradually and to a moderate temperature, so it’s less likely to curdle.\n\nLemon juice is sometimes added to tea to bolster its tartness and add the fresh citrus note to its aroma. It also lightens the color of brewed black tea by altering the structure of the red phenolic complexes (the complexes are weak acids themselves, and take up hydrogen ions from the lemon juice). Alkaline brewing water, conversely, tends to produce blood-red infusions from black tea, and can even make green tea red.\n\n**Iced Tea**\nIced tea is the most popular form of tea in the United States; it first caught on at the 1904 World’s Fair in steamy St. Louis. It's made by brewing tea with about half-again as much dry tea per cup, to compensate for the later dilution by melting ice. The addition of ice to normally brewed tea tends to make the tea cloudy, due to the formation of particles of a complex between caffeine and theaflavin. The way to avoid this is to brew the initial tea at room or refrigerator temperature, over several hours. This technique extracts less caffeine and theaflavin than brewing in hot water, so"

These recipes can be scaled up as necessary. Here are a few pointers on making your own syrups at home:\n\n- **When making syrup, apply heat only when necessary to dissolve the sugar or extract flavor from additional ingredients (such as in Cinnamon Bark Syrup). Heating sugar changes its flavor and texture, and it’s difficult to keep it consistent from one batch to another.**\n\n- **Superfine sugar makes the task of dissolving a little easier, but granulated sugar will work just fine; the process will just require more time and patience. Be aware that 1 cup of superfine sugar will yield a sweeter syrup than 1 cup of granulated, so either measure by weight or make DIY superfine sugar by whizzing the correct quantity of granulated sugar in a blender or food processor. It’s important to always measure the sugar and water separately. If you measure them together, the sugar will already be dissolving, so the final syrup may not have the right proportions of sweetness or density.**\n\n- **Store syrups in a refrigerator until you’re ready to use them. It’s generally best to allow cooked syrups to cool to room temperature before transferring to a storage container and refrigerating. Most infused syrups will keep for 1 or 2 weeks before they start losing flavor, though the higher the sugar content, the longer the syrup will keep. To ensure good results, taste stored syrups before each use.**"

Well, in all of my years of matching wine and food, I have yet to discover a pairing that can show off a complex, mature Cabernet better than a simple rib roast. This dish is all about showcasing the wine—plain and simple. The rarer the better, in my opinion, but that’s personal, as many diners are not enamored of rare meat. Fear not, as the wine will work with all degrees of doneness: blue (very, very rare), rare, medium, and, yes, even well done. The caramelized elements of the glaze (especially the coffee and soy) create a flavorful crust, and the oven roasting brings out sweet charred elements that match well with the wine. —Evan\n\n#### Recommended Producers:\nAged, Developed Cabernet Sauvignons\n\n| Category  | Producer                             | Location                      |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Everyday  | Concha y Toro                        | Central Valley, Chile         |\n|           | Mitchelton                           | Victoria, Australia           |\n|           | Château Citran                       | Bordeaux, France              |\n| Premium   | L'Ecole No. 41                       | Walla Walla Valley, Washington |\n|           | Joseph Phelps                        | Napa Valley, California       |\n|           | Château Sociando Mallet              | Bordeaux, France              |\n| Splurge   | Cakebread Cellars                    | Napa Valley, California       |\n|           | Leonetti                             | Walla Walla Valley, Washington |\n|           | Château Ducru-Beaucaillou            | Bordeaux, France              | \n\n---\n\nThe document provides insight on the ideal wine pairings for a rib roast meal, stressing that complex, mature Cabernet Sauvignons can enhance the dish without the need for a sauce.

These differences are contextualized within a broader academic discussion, referencing Filipino ethnologists R.C. Mabesa and J.S. Babaan, who documented these variations. A 1992 paper by Minerva Olympia from the Philippine Institute of Fish Processing Technology is cited, indicating that despite variations in preparation, the overall quality of the products remains unchanged.\n\nThe document concludes by reflecting on the limits of book learning compared to experiential learning, emphasizing that direct experience is crucial to fully understand and appreciate such dishes and techniques."

He was mortified when the very first cheese sample he sent to the state Department of Agriculture tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, and subsequent batches tested positive for _Staphylococcus aureus_. Levels were not so high that the state prohibited their sale as cheese, and no bacterially produced enterotoxins were found; whether to sell or discard the cheese was \"a management decision,\" he was told. Nathan chose to play it safe and discarded them.\n\nIn the end, the farm culled its herd of the cows that tested positive for _S. aureus_, because as a certified organic farm they cannot treat animals with antibiotics. Nathan's advice to fledgling farmstead cheesemakers is to test cows for _S. aureus_. Test each teat when you get the cows and every month thereafter. Also test every batch of cheese at three days and at maturity for both _S. aureus_ and _L. monocytogenes_. Test a sample from the bulk tank monthly. With culling and frequent testing, Nathan was able to solve the creamery’s contamination problems, with the help of a French cheesemaking technical consultant and a voluntary HACCP plan, which he regards as a “proactive stance that demonstrates responsibility.”\n\nNow that Nathan and his team have the cheesemaking down, they are finding it difficult to sell all the cheese they are making, so they must increase their cave-conditions storage capacity and further develop their marketing. “The learning curve is huge!” he reflects. The dairy has spent many thousands of dollars on bacteriological testing and now routinely spends more than 4 percent of its gross income on testing. Nathan takes the long view and regards these comprehensive safety measures as being imperative."

Here’s the structured content breakdown:\n\n### Legumes\n- **Origin and Definition**: Derived from the Latin word \"legere,\" which means \"to gather.” They are part of the Leguminosae family.\n- **Characteristics**: \n  - They climb on tall grasses and other plants to reach sunlight.\n  - Die over a few months but produce seeds rich in protein due to their symbiosis with bacteria that fix nitrogen from the air.\n  - Attract animals due to their large seeds.\n  - Camouflaged against insects, protected by various chemical defenses.\n- **Examples**: Lentils, broad beans, peas, and chickpeas from the Near East; soy and mung beans from Asia; peanuts, lima beans, and common beans from the Americas.\n- **Cultural Importance**: Used as rotation crops since Roman times due to the nitrogen enrichment they provide to the soil.\n\n### Nuts\n- **Origin and Definition**: From an Indo-European root meaning \"compressed.” \n- **Characteristics**: \n  - Generally large seeds enclosed in hard shells and borne on long-lived trees.\n  - The seeds are large both to make them attractive to animal dispersers (which bury them for later use) and to provide a seedling with an adequate food supply for slow, prolonged growth in partial shade.\n- **Dietary Significance**: Less important in the human diet mainly due to delayed fruiting, cannot produce as much per acre as grains and legumes.\n\n### Seeds and Health\n- **Nutritional Benefits**:\n  - Major sources of energy and protein.\n  - Provide essential B vitamins necessary for energy generation and tissue building.\n- **Historical Context**: \n  - Beriberi affected rice-eating populations in Asia in the 19th century due to milling processes removing vital nutrients.\n  - Pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency, affected populations in Europe and the U.S. in the 18th and 19th centuries, also corrected through dietary enhancements.\n  \nThe text highlights the importance of seeds, discussing their adaptation, nutritional value, and impacts on health historically, including the diseases associated with nutrient deficiencies and the evolution of food processing methods that have helped alleviate these issues."

For absinthe to be acknowledged as legitimate, it must contain the leaves and flowers of grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), a plant in the same family as tarragon, anise seed, fennel, melissa (aka lemon balm), and hyssop, another shrub with a long medicinal history. There are many misconceptions about absinthe, mostly centering around the idea that it causes people to go crazy or hallucinate. It’s true that the wormwood in absinthe contains thujone, a substance once thought to be a powerful hallucinogen. However, true absinthe contains only trace amounts of thujone, as this compound barely survives distillation. And thanks to advances in modern science, thujone levels in absinthe can now be tested, so this spirit is no longer banned in the United States.\n\n#### RECOMMENDED BOTTLE\n**Emile Pernot Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe**: A classic French absinthe with prominent wormwood and anise flavors. We load the stuff into dasher bottles and use it frequently but sparingly, in a similar manner to bitters. It’s also our go-to rinsing absinthe for Sazerac-style cocktails.\n\n### VAN OOSTEN BATAVIA ARRACK\n\nDistilled from sugarcane and red rice, Batavia arrack is believed to be the historical precursor to rum and the ingredient first used in punch, which was invented by British soldiers stationed in India. It’s funky and pungent—and a required ingredient for many classic punches. It has become a rite of passage for Death & Co bartenders, many of whom have had at least a passing obsession with it at some point in their career."

Below is the text content presented in English, followed by the structured table.\n\n---\n\n### How to Sprout Legumes\nSprouting multiplies the nutritional value of seeds, in vitamins, minerals and by transforming their amino acids, making them easier to digest.\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n- 2 to 3 tablespoons of legumes  \n- Water  \n\n**Utensils:**  \n- A sprouting jar or a bowl covered with a cheesecloth and rubber band  \n- Fine strainer  \n\n**Steps:**\n1. Place your legumes on a dish below.\n2. Place them in a sprouting jar or in a green colored bowl covered with cheesecloth using a rubber band.\n\n3. Rinse thoroughly every morning and evening, under the jar if possible or by placing them in a strainer. Continue until a thin root and the leaves have started to sprout (alfalfa, lentil, etc.).\n\n4. The legumes should stay in a humid environment, away from direct sunlight and with adequate water drainage.\n   \n5. Once the desired size of sprouts is achieved, transfer the sprouted legumes to a sealed container and store for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.\n\n**Chef’s Tip:**  \nFor mung beans, azuki beans, lentils, and chickpeas, sprouting enhances digestibility, shortens cooking times, and maximizes nutrient intake. The cooking time is about 15 to 20 minutes, and they are consumed as usual.\n\n**Recipe Ideas:**\n- Muffins with peas, spinach, and sprouted grains, p.224\n- Indonesian Trancam, p.230\n- Gado-gado with tempeh, p.323\n\n---\n\n**Sprouting Times Table:**\n\n| Type of Legume | Soaking Time | Germination Time  |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Azuki          | 14 to 18 hours | 3 to 5 days      |\n| Mung Bean      | 10 to 16 hours | 3 to 4 days      |\n| Lentils        | 8 to 12 hours    | 2 to 5 days     |\n| Chickpeas      | 14 to 18 hours | 2 to 3 days      |\n| Alfalfa        | 4 to 8 hours     | 3 to 7 days     |\n\n---\n\nThis table and guide provide a straightforward method for sprouting various legumes, detailing necessary preparations and expected time frames."

But in the summer of 2011, sitting in my office in the Napa Valley, I picked up the ringing phone and to my utter surprise, on the other end of the line was a monk and the winemaker of the eleventh-century Alaverdi Monastery in Kakheti, Republic of Georgia. He asked if he and his colleagues could meet with me and bring their wines to taste. There is only one answer to that question, and so the next day a bearded man clad in voluminous black robes with a large Orthodox Christian cross hanging from his neck and a rosary in his hand walked into my office, followed by ten other Georgian vintners. Before they sat down, they sang a folk song, for an old Georgian tradition insists that men sing before they drink.\n\n![Qvevri waiting to be filled with wine, then buried underground.](image-url)\n\nMany of the wines they brought with them were so-called “orange wines”—almost neon orange in color—that had been made in qvevri (KEV-ree), large, egg-shaped clay vessels, lined with beeswax and buried entirely underground. Drinking these wines was like nothing I had ever experienced.\n\nOne of the oldest agricultural societies in the world, Georgia is nestled on the isthmus between the Black and Caspian Seas, and lies just north of Turkey and south of Russia and the great Caucasus Mountains. Wine has been made here for over eight thousand years, and Georgia, along with Turkey, Iran, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, is considered one of the world’s earliest sites of grapevine domestication and winemaking. For millennia, much of that wine was renowned. But throughout the twentieth century, Georgia was caught in the political turmoil of the Soviet Union (of which it was a part) and wine quality suffered. Suppressed, the wine industry regressed. Then, in 1991, Georgia gained its political independence."

Here's a structured representation of the textual content from the image:\n\n---\n\n### UNDERSTANDING WINES: EXPLAINING STYLE AND QUALITY\n\n**Caption**: Flat vineyards in the Uco Valley. Here altitude not aspect is the key to quality.\n\n---\n\n### REGIONS AND WINES\n\n**Argentina** has a GI system, in common with most New World countries. The vineyard area is split into three broad regions, of which only Patagonia is widely seen on wine labels. Each region is split into a number of provinces, which, in turn, contain a number of more specific departments.\n\n#### Salta Province\n- **Location**: Close to the border of Bolivia and is the most northerly of the vineyard areas in Argentina. \n- **Altitude**: Some of the highest vineyards in the world, with some located at over 3000 meters above sea level.\n- **Dominant Varieties**: Torrontés is the dominant grape, producing highly aromatic wines, especially in the Cafayate region.\n- **Note**: Many of the large wineries based in Mendoza and some major European wine companies have invested in this region for its superior quality of Torrontés. Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon are the other dominant black varieties planted in Cafayate.\n\n#### La Rioja Province\n- **Location**: Has the third largest area of production in Argentina.\n- **Main Vineyard Area**: The Famatina Valley, where large volumes of grapes can be grown on the irrigated valley floors. Torrontés is a specialty of this province, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Bonarda being the most planted black varieties.\n- **Note**: To avoid confusion with the Rioja region in Spain, these exported wines are generally labeled as Famatina.\n\n#### San Juan Province\n- **Overview**: Argentina’s second most important wine area. The vineyards are located at approximately 450 to 1400 meters above sea level.\n- **Climate**: A similar altitude range to those of Mendoza to the south (where the conditions are hotter and more arid). The province is particularly noted for the quality of its Syrah. Other grapes that flourish are Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda. Chardonnay and Viognier are the most planted white varieties.\n\n#### Mendoza Province\n- **Dominance**: Dominates winemaking in Argentina and accounts for the vast majority of wine produced. The vineyards are planted in different conditions, protected from rain in the west by the huge Andes Mountains and from the east by the vastness of the Argentine Pampas.\n- **Regions**: Mendoza can be split broadly into five divisions: Northern, Eastern, Central, Uco Valley and Southern.\n- **Grapes**: The grapes or wines from these different divisions are often blended to take advantage of fruit from different climates.\n- **Wine Production**: Both Northern and Eastern Mendoza are generally areas where the focus is on high-volume, inexpensive wines. The Mendoza river that flows through these areas provides irrigation water, making growing large quantities of grapes possible.\n- **Notable Wine**: Central Mendoza has the longest history of producing high-quality wines and many of the most famous producers are based here. The Luján de Cuyo department in particular has a reputation for producing superior quality wines.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured content provides a summarized version of the details related to wine regions in Argentina along with their specific characteristics and importance with respect to wine production."
