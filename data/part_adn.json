    "contenu": "```markdown\n# THE TOP TWENTY-FIVE GRAPES TO KNOW\n\n## ALBARIÑO\n\nOne of the liveliest white wines in Europe and considered one of the best wines for seafood, albariño (al-bar-EEN-yo) comes from the region of Rías Baixas (REE-az BUY-shaz), along northeastern Spain’s ruggedly beautiful and very green northwestern coast (it looks like Ireland). In the past decade, albariño has become Spain’s most notable and delicious dry white table wine, even though the dry whites of Rioja (made from the grape variety viura) were once better known. Albariño is floral and citrusy, but not quite as aromatic as, say, riesling or gewürztraminer. It is rarely made or aged in oak and is best when young and snappy. Interestingly, unlike most Spanish (or European) wines, which are named for the place from which they come, albariño is always labeled just that—albariño. (See also Rías Baixas, page 485). Albariño, for all its fame in Spain, probably originated in northeastern Portugal, where it has grown for centuries and where it is known as alvarinho. It is still grown widely there and is the core grape in vinho verde.\n\n## BARBERA\n\nBarbera (bar-BEAR-a), the most widely planted red grape in the northwestern Italian region of Piedmont, rose to prominence there after the phylloxera epidemic (page 30). Genetic research suggests it probably originated someplace else and was brought to Piedmont. Its parents are not known.\n\nEven though nebbiolo (the grape used to make Barolo and Barbaresco) is more renowned, it’s barbera, not nebbiolo, that Piedmontese winemakers invariably drink with dinner. Beginning in the mid 1980s, the quality of barbera rose dramatically. By planting it in better sites, limiting the yield, and aging the wine in better barrels, Piedmontese winemakers began making superbly mouthfilling, rich wines packed with flavor. Top barberas also have a natural vivacity—a precision and vibrancy that comes from the grapes’ relatively high acidity. Today, all of the great barberas come from Piedmont, and the grape is rarely planted elsewhere, although there is a small amount grown in northern California. A century ago, Italian immigrants in California planted it in poor, usually hot areas, hoping to make a hearty, low-cost red wine. After a brief resurgence as part of the “Cal-Ital” movement of the early 1990s, barbera sadly began to decline in importance there.\n\n## CABERNET FRANC\n\nWhile not as well known as its offspring, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, cabernet franc (CAB-er-nay FRONK) plays an important role in many of the world’s top Bordeaux and Bordeaux-style blends. Indeed, on the so-called “Right Bank” of Bordeaux, in the appellations Pomerol and St.-Émilion, cabernet franc can make up 50 percent of the blend or more as is often the case with the legendary Bordeaux wine Château Cheval Blanc.\n\nCompared to its Bordeaux confreres, cabernet franc is generally not as fleshy as merlot, nor is it as structured and intense as cabernet sauvignon. For many wineries, it thus sits in a slightly different niche.\n```"

    "contenu": "The document consists of two sections detailing specific steps in wine tasting to enhance the experience and appreciation of the wine. Below is the structured content of the document:\n\n### 3. TAKE A SIP AND SWISH IT AROUND FOR A COUPLE SECONDS TO COAT THE PALATE.\nProfessionals tasting many wines will spit to keep their heads clear. But even if you swallow, you must allow the wine to hit every surface of your mouth, in a similar way to using mouthwash. When the wine hits the tip of the tongue, notice if it is dry or imparts a hint of sweetness. Inhale after swallowing and reassess the aromas as they become flavors. What began as general impressions of fruit, wood, and earth may coalesce into specifics, such as blueberry or cherry, vanilla or caramel, mushrooms or wet gravel. Acidity makes itself known as a zing along the sides of the tongue that causes your mouth to water. By contrast, tannin has no taste but manifests itself as a tactile sensation after swallowing, as though the tongue were being dried with a towel. When in the mouth, alcohol feels thicker than water, giving a textural sensation of body. Light-bodied wines feel sheer, like water, and full-bodied wines feel richer, like a milkshake.\n\n### 4. TAKE A MINUTE TO CONTEMPLATE THE WINE, NOTING ITS FINISH.\nGreat wines can reverberate on the palate for minutes after they've been swallowed—similar to the elongated note of a tuning fork—whereas poorly made wines often fall with a thud. Wine professionals judge quality by observing the interplay of lingering flavors, taste, and tactile sensations. Is the wine balanced or askew? How much “length” is in the finish? Only careful farming and winemaking can produce this resonance, and it is completely independent of color or power scale. A long and harmonious finish distinguishes fine wine, regardless of whether it is as delicate as Champagne or as dense as Amarone."

    "contenu": "The document discusses Assyrtyko, a type of wine primarily produced in Greece, particularly famous for being cultivated on the slopes of Santorini. The key points covered in the document include:\n\n1. **Characteristics of Assyrtiko Wine:**\n   - Assyrtiko wine thrives on the unique, steep volcanic soil of Santorini. It generally exhibits bright, tart flavors, characterized by mineral, zesty lemon, and yellow grapefruit notes.\n   - Due to its natural high acidity and strong mineral flavor, it's challenging to cultivate, especially because of the desiccating summer winds on Santorini. Local growers adapt by using small baskets to protect the vines in hollows in the soil.\n   - Outside Athens, Assyrtiko is often blended with other grapes to make retsina, a resin-flavored wine.\n\n2. **Cultivation and Blending:**\n    - While Assyrtiko is primarily grown in Santorini, it also blends well with other international grapes, especially Sauvignon Blanc.\n    - Outside Greece, it is not commercially produced, yet its popularity is increasing due to its affinity with food and crisp flavor, which is comparable to other well-known wines like Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño.\n    - Locally in Greece, varieties blended with Assyrtiko, such as Assyrtiko-Chardonnay and Assyrtiko-Sauvignon Blanc, are becoming more prevalent.\n\n3. **Wine Types and Styles:**\n    - The document outlines three principal styles of Assyrtiko:\n      a. Lean and mean style with sharp acidity, typically not aged in oak (most similar to Riesling).\n      b. Textured style with less acidity but more body and ripeness, sometimes featuring oak aging.\n      c. A rare barreled-aged style that is age-worthy and complex, often targeted at drinkers of Chardonnay and other big white wines.\n    \n4. **Other notable information:**\n    - Not all Assyrtiko wines are destined for monovarietal bottlings; many are well-suited to blends.\n    - Assyrtiko also complements Vinsanto, a fortified dessert wine from Greece, which must contain at least 51% Assyrtiko.\n\nIn conclusion, the document emphasizes Assyrtiko's role both as a unique, standalone wine and as a versatile component in blends, celebrated for its crisp, refreshing flavor and strong mineral backbone, making it favored both locally and increasingly abroad."

Here is a formatted version of the text content from the image:\n\n---\n\n**BUILDING A STIRRED COCKTAIL**\n\nWhen making stirred cocktails, always start with a cold mixing glass or pint glass (see \"Mixing Glass,\"). Keep your mixing glass in the freezer between uses, or fill it with ice water for a few minutes and then dump it out.\n\n1. **Add the ingredients**, starting with the cheapest and/or smallest volume ingredients first. This way, if you mess up you can start over without wasting large quantities of ingredients or more expensive spirits and modifiers.\n   \n2. **Give the mixture a couple of quick stirs.**\n\n3. **Add enough ice cubes** to fill the glass about three-quarters full (use Kold-Draft ice or 1-inch ice cubes; see \"Ice,\"), layering the ice as tightly as possible. If you're using a pint glass or large chunks of ice, you may need to crack the ice so it fits more tightly into the glass; otherwise, you'll end up with a stack of cubes, and it will take forever to chill and dilute the drink.\n\n4. **Hold the mixing glass steady** near its base with two or three fingers; any more or higher, and the heat from your hand will warm the glass.\n\n5. **Stir the drink in a steady rhythm**, stopping after about 15 seconds.\n\n6. **Taste the drink.** Trap a bit using a cocktail straw and your finger, or spoon a small amount onto the back of your hand; don’t slurp from the spoon you're using to stir the drink. Is it cold and diluted to your liking? If the answer is no, stir for a few more seconds and taste again.\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach simplifies the process of building a stirred cocktail, providing clear steps and tips to ensure optimal results and minimal waste."

This bouquet pulls up the ocean taste from the shrimp and fish. The grit of the couscous and the light crunch of the asparagus punctuate. There's a sharp, slightly picante edge to the watercress, and light heat from the ginger.**\n\n### SOFT-SHELL CRABS WITH ORANGE AND BLUE CRAB REMOULADE\n\n**SOFT-SHELL CRABS ARE REAL CRABS, but they don't have the deep shellfish flavor of hard-shell crabs. We get that extra layer of flavor in this recipe by making a shellfish sauce with whole hard-shell crabs. The fennel salad on which it is served adds another level of garden crunch and tang that complements the crunchy crust. It may seem wasteful to use whole crabs in the sauce, but that's the only way to get the deep flavor that we're looking for. In classic cuisine, remoulade is mayonnaise with capers, hardboiled eggs, parsley, and cornichon.**\n\n**SERVES 4 AS AN APPETIZER**\n\n### REMOULADE\n\n- **2 cups Basic Lobster Sauce, Crab Variation (page 224)**\n- **1 egg yolk, at room temperature**\n- **¾ cup grapeseed oil**\n- **Kosher salt**\n- **Freshly ground white pepper**\n- **Cayenne pepper**\n\n--- \n\nThis structured content captures the setup, main narrative, culinary details, and the recipe components as they appear in the document."

    "contenu": "**Taste**\n\nEvery ingredient has its **stereotypical taste** (bananas are sweet), plus its **actual taste**, which may be a function of its age or ripeness. For example, a banana may increase noticeably in sweetness as it ripens and its color changes from green to yellow to brown. That is why it’s crucial to taste your ingredients when cooking. If you don’t — and, as a result, don’t end up making other adjustments (for example, slightly decreasing the amount of sugar used when using very ripe bananas) — you’ll find your dishes to be out of balance. Even seemingly similar ingredients (such as regular versus aged balsamic vinegar, or Italian versus Thai basil) can vary dramatically.\n\n**York Street’s Sharon Hage on Classic Flavor Pairings**\n\nI try to eat a lot of different foods and read a lot of different types of books to try to break away from classic pairings. I have had a million pork dishes, and I keep thinking that there has to be something else besides pork with sage! I try all these different things then turn to another cook and say, “Got any sage?”\nThere is a reason for tomatoes with basil, and for lamb with mint. What I don’t make is lamb with mint jelly — but there will likely be some mint someplace on the dish.\nRoasted beets work with salty cheese, whether it is [Italian] ricotta salata, or [Mexican] queso fresco, or another country’s version of salty cheese.\nThe fun part is to discover what the classic pairing is, then present it to people in a way that makes them think it is different, while still being true to you as a chef. It would be hard to imagine summer tomatoes without the basil component. We might add some chives or mint or sumac, but the dish will still have some basil as well."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects related to the perception of sweetness or dryness in wines:\n\n1. **Many Factors Influence Our Perception of a Wine’s Sweetness or Dryness:**\n   - Human senses are sensitive and can perceive wines with identical sugar levels differently due to factors such as acidity, bitterness, carbonation, and alcohol content. Elevated alcohol can increase the perception of sweetness.\n   - Certain sugars like fructose may taste sweeter than others like glucose.\n   - Associative sensations also play a role, where the aroma of the wine (e.g., raisins vs. lemon peel) can influence the perceived sweetness.\n\n2. **The Vast Majority of Wines are Dry, but There are Exceptions That Range from Faintly Sweet to Sticky-Candy Sweet:**\n   - Historically, wines have been made dry to maximize alcoholic strength and minimize spoilage, but some sweetness is considered pleasant. \n   - Techniques such as interrupting fermentation or blending with stabilized juice are used to achieve desired sweetness levels in wine.\n\n3. **Very Few Labels Provide an Indication of Sweetness, and Those That Do Typically Use Unfamiliar Terms:**\n   - Most premium wines are dry and do not include sweetness indicators on their labels.\n   - There is contention over what metrics to use for indicating sweetness, as residual sugar alone may not accurately reflect perceptible sweetness. The document refers to a chart on sweetness terminology, presumably on the next page, which is not visible in this document snippet.\n\nOverall, the document discusses the complexity of determining and describing the sweetness in wines, influenced by various factors and not always clearly labeled."

    "contenu": "The document contains both text and a diagram that illustrates a structured wheel of flavor profiles or categories. The text discusses categorization and the sequential development of flavor families while exploring their complex relationships. Below, I provide a transcription and interpretation of the flavor wheel presented in the image:\n\n### Text Summary:\nThe text describes an exploration of flavor families starting with \"Roncé & Haie\" leading sequentially around the wheel to various other flavor profiles, ending with \"Fromage bleu.\" It acknowledges the challenges and subjectivity in classifying specific flavors, like coriander, which could fit into multiple flavor categories. The author discusses how the preparation of ingredients can significantly affect their flavor profiles, using the example of cabbage, which can range from \"Mustardée\" when raw to \"Sulfurée\" when cooked. The wheel is described as an intuitive guide rather than a definitive framework, intended to help navigate flavor relationships and combinations.\n\n### Flavor Wheel Diagram Content:\nThe diagram shows a circle segmented into various flavor profiles. Here are the flavor categories listed clockwise starting from the top (12 o'clock position):\n\n1. Citron\n2. Fromage Bleu\n3. Roncé & Haie\n4. Fruitée Florale\n5. Framboise\n6. Caramélisé\n7. Terreuse\n8. Moutardée\n9. Sulfurée\n10. Motrin\n11. Stimulante & Sèche\n12. Verte & Fraiche\n13. Poivrée\n14. Fumée\n15. Fruitée Chandelle\n16. Troglodyte\n17. Coriandre\n18. Fruitée (returns to Citron)\n\nThis wheel highlights the continuity and transitions between different taste profiles, underscoring the complex connections in flavor categorization mentioned in the text. The names suggest a mix of straightforward and more whimsically named categories, reflecting a creative attempt to capture the nuanced experiences of taste."

Below is the structured content summarized into two main parts: \n\n---\n\n**California Port-style Wines Background**\n\n- **Nature:** Mixed quality; historical production included inexpensive, syrupy-sweet wines from poor-quality, overripe grapes.\n- **Modern Quality:** Current quality wines use better grape varieties such as Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, and Tinta Roriz; notable examples from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.\n- **Highlighted Producer:** Quady, known especially for its rich, citrusy, mocha-y Port-style wine named Starboard.\n- **Legal Compliance:** Post 2006, U.S. wines that want to use the term \"Port\" can only do so if the brand name hasn't changed and precedes 2006. Prager Royal Escort Port meets these legal requirements as it pre-dates 2006.\n\n**Quote on Wine by Jim Harrison**\n- **Source:** Essay \"Wine\"\n- **Quote:** \n  “The simple physical act of opening a bottle of wine has brought more happiness to the human race than all the collective governments in the history of the earth. Even organized religions are mere spiritual mousetraps compared to the ‘pop’ of a cork, the delicious squeak when you loosen it from the firm grip of the corkscrew. And then the grandeur of the burble as we fill the glass, the very same sound we hear at the source, the wombs of all the rivers on earth.”\n\n--- \n\nThis structure provides a detailed look at the insights given in the document, highlighting the quality improvements of California Port-style wines and a poetic perspective on the joy wine brings to human experiences."

Determine how tightly you push the front of the strainer against the mixing tin to allow or prevent small ice chips from entering the drink.\n  * Choose how to close the gate based on personal preference or the desired texture of the drink. \n\n### Images Description\n\nThree images are shown:\n- Left: Straining a stirred drink.\n- Center: Straining a shaken drink.\n- Right: Double straining a shaken drink.\n\nThese images depict different straining techniques, providing visuals to support the text."

The key themes and particulars from the document are summarized below:\n\n1. **Regional Focus:**\n   - Mention is made of several wine regions in Portugal: Minho, Douro, Dão, Bairrada, and Alentejo.\n\n2. **Historical Overview:**\n   - Historically, Portugal had a dichotomy in its wine production: the renowned Port wines and the less known, often mediocre table wines. These two types of wine production rarely overlapped.\n   - The table wines, often from cooperatives, were predominantly cheap and uninspired except for a few exceptions.\n\n3. **Changes and Developments:**\n   - A significant change began following Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community in 1986.\n   - By the late 20th century, some of the most underrated but quality dry red and white table wines started to emerge from Portugal.\n   - These wines, characterized by bold, distinctive reds and fresh, flavorful whites, became noted for their quality and value.\n\n4. **Contemporary Scene:**\n   - In recent years, top Portuguese wine firms have begun producing high-quality dry wines, especially red wines that are priced comparably to famous international wines like those from Napa Valley or Bordeaux.\n\nThis document does not contain any specific structured table/dataset but provides a descriptive analysis of the evolution and current state of Portuguese table wines."
