Once fermented, they will become Greek vinsánto.**\n\n**Santorini Wines:**\n- Traditionally, wines from Santorini were crisp, dry whites made from Assyrtiko grapes. They were known for their simplicity, purity, and freshness, suitable for the island's seafood-based cuisine.\n- In recent years, Santorini wines have evolved to a riper style and sometimes aged in oak, leading to a broader taste, which some feel deviates from their traditional appeal.\n\n**Santorini Dessert Wine:**\n- Santorini is famous for **vinsánto**, a sweet dessert wine akin to the Tuscan dessert wine **vin santo**. The term \"vinsánto\" is derived from the contraction of \"vin\" (wine) and \"Santorini\".\n- For vinsánto production, Assyrtiko and mandilaria grapes are dried on mats in the sun for around one to two weeks to concentrate the sugars. After half-fermentation, known as \"half-baked,\" the wine is aged in barrels for ten years, contributing to its mellow, rich flavor.\n\n**Crete Wines:**\n- Crete was among the first regions to develop a systematic approach to viticulture and winemaking.\n- Key grape varieties unique to Crete include Kotsifali (noted for its softness) and Mandilaria (noted for its structure). These grapes are blended to produce the renowned red wines of Archanes, a prominent wine region on the island.\n\n---\nThis summary encapsulates the key points about traditional and modern wine-growing techniques and the specific types of wines associated with Santorini and Crete, Greece."

    "contenu": "The document provides detailed insights into the production and aging process of Armagnac, comparing its distillation and aging methodologies to those of Cognac. Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Introduction to Armagnac**:\n   - Armagnac differs from other spirits due to its double distillation process in continuous stills, which refines its flavors and aromas.\n   - The production of Armagnac typically involves smaller, historically rooted producers compared to larger Cognac houses like Courvoisier and Martell.\n   - Distillation carried out by traveling distillers from November to January.\n\n2. **Aging Process**:\n   - It starts when the eau-de-vie (distilled spirit) is aged in oak barrels, particularly from black oak of the Monlezun forest.\n   - Aging in wood allows evaporation of water and alcohol, concentrating the liquid. The final alcohol level is adjusted to 40 percent or 80 proof.\n\n3. **Categorization and Aging Terms**:\n   - Armagnac is categorized by quality terms and age. Terms like VS (Very Superior), VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale), Napoleon, and XO (Extra Old) indicate different lengths of aging:\n   \n     | Category      | Age Description       |\n     |----------------|----------------------------|\n     | VS or *** (Very Superior / Three Star) | 1-3 years |\n     | VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) | 4-9 years |\n     | Napoléon      | 6-9 years |\n     | XO (Extra Old) and Hors d'Age       | 10-19 years |\n     | XO Premium    | More than 20 years |\n\n4. **Vintage Labeling**:\n   - Unlike Cognac, Armagnac can also be designated by the vintage year. The eau-de-vie in a vintage Armagnac must come entirely from that year and be aged in barrels for a minimum of ten years before bottling.\n   - The label must indicate the bottling date to identify when the Armagnac was transferred from barrel to bottle.\n\n5. **Bottling and Aging**:\n   - Armagnac does not continue to age once bottled, as it is protected from the influence of oxygen.\n   - Once bottled, even if the vintage year is different, the maturity of the alcohol is considered the same, provided it was aged the same total time in barrels.\n\n6. **Flavor Profile**:\n   - Quality Armagnac typically features complex flavors reminiscent of prunes, quince, and dried apricots.\n\nThis structured overview highlights the traditional and meticulous processes that define the character and quality of Armagnac."

In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the minced shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes.\n2. Add the ras el hanout to the shallots and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to remove the raw spice taste. Remove from heat and let cool.\n3. In a bowl, combine the crabmeat, cooled shallot and spice mixture, coconut cream, lemon juice, cilantro, and jalapeño. Gently fold using a rubber spatula until well mixed. Season with salt and pepper. The mixture can be prepared an hour or so in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Do not make it any further ahead, as it may become watery.\n\n**Onion Rings**\n1. Separate the onion slices into rings.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until blended. Put the flour in another small bowl.\n3. Pour sufficient canola oil into a sauté pan or saucepan to reach a depth of 1 inch and heat it to 350°F on a deep-frying thermometer.\n4. Coat the onion rings first in egg then dredge in flour, and deep-fry.\n\nThe recipe page number is 102 in the book titled \"Prosecco.\" This page does not contain any images apart from the header and there is a note to 'see note' following the use of ras el hanout and coconut cream, possibly referring to additional information elsewhere in the book."

There are four identified types of free-pourers categorized based on their mindset and approach:\n\n1. **The Lazy**: These bartenders don't particularly care about the accuracy of their pouring, perhaps valuing convenience over precision.\n\n2. **The Speedy**: This group believes that free-pouring is sufficiently accurate and considerably more time-efficient, which is a critical factor during busy times at the bar.\n\n3. **The Artist**: Artists find measuring cups cumbersome and feel that using them undermines their skill and finesse. They prioritize the visual and performative aspect of making a drink.\n\n4. **The Monk**: Monks pour by feel and adjust their ingredients based on taste and intuition rather than fixed measurements. They do not believe in confining drink recipes strictly to set proportions suggested by recipes but adjust depending on individual taste and preference.\n\nThe author also describes the skill involved in masterful \"jigger-work,\" which is about creating a visually appealing and accurate drink through experienced pouring and estimates. This opposes the view that using a jigger (measuring tool) is unskilled.\n\nOverall, the document explains why some bartenders prefer free-pour techniques and details the philosophy each type holds about the art and science of mixing drinks without strict measurements."

Hemingway, known more widely for his hard spirits drinking, had a specific ritual involving bullfighting events, with his final visit being in 1959. The legendary bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez, frequently accompanying Hemingway, is noted as the inspiration for Hemingway’s work *Death in the Afternoon*.\n\n**Hemingway's Philosophy on Wine:**\nA quote from Hemingway's *A Moveable Feast* is included to illustrate his views on wine: “In Europe then we thought of wine as something as healthy and normal as food and also as a great giver of happiness and well being and delight. Drinking wine was not a snobbism nor a sign of sophistication nor a cult; it was as natural as eating and to me as necessary.”\n\n**Current Perception of Rioja Wines:**\nThe text concludes by contrasting two styles of Rioja wines available today:\n1. **Old World Style:** Well-aged, mellow, earthy wines with faint notes of vanilla.\n2. **New World Style:** Fruit-driven, more dramatically oaky wines described as having an extroverted style.\n\n---\n\nThe document uses narrative and descriptive language to convey Hemingway’s deep connection with the Spanish culture and wine, and it highlights the evolution of wine tasting from a simple, almost essential pleasure to a more complex and diverse cultural phenomenon."

Blending can take place at any stage during the winemaking process but is mainly carried out after fermentation or during the maturation process. It can be used to improve balance, attain consistency or achieve a certain style. When blending involves wines from different grape varieties, vineyard locations or vintages, the winemaker will need to be aware of any constraints imposed by local winemaking regulations (see section **Label Integrity** in Chapter 11).\n\n### Key Aspects of Blending\n- **Balance** - Adjusts the balance of the wine, enhancing its quality. For example, when making a red wine, free run wine may be blended with press wine to increase the tannins in the final product.\n- **Consistency** - Ensures minimal variation among bottles of a single product, achieved by blending wines matured in small barrels or large vats.\n- **Style** - Important for deciding and maintaining the style of wine. Weather variations in different vintages may cause winemakers to blend their wines in a way to match a certain house style. This style may range from simple to elegant.\n\n## Clarification\nThe vast majority of customers expect their wines to be perfectly clear. There are three main techniques a winemaker can use to achieve this:\n- **Sedimentation** - Occurs post fermentation. Sedimentation involves the natural settling of solids with the potentially gentle pumping of wine to a different vessel leaving the sediment behind.\n- **Fining** - A process that involves adding a fining agent to the wine to bind with cloudy constituents and speed up sedimentation, thus improving clarity and preparing wines for bottling.\n- **Filtration** - Physically removes particles from the wine post fermentation and during maturation to ensure clarity and stability.\n\n**Note**: Some customers do not mind, or even prefer, some natural sediment or cloudiness in their wine as it does not necessarily detract from the wine’s character or quality and may avoid interventions that could potentially affect the wine's flavor and texture.\n```"

    "contenu": "---\n\nEven though refractometers technically measure refractive index, that isn’t what we care about—we care about how refractive index correlates to the concentration of whatever we’re interested in: sugar, ethanol, salt, propylene glycol, whatever. So refractometers usually have scales that read in terms of those solutions. You can buy a refractometer for sugar, one for salt, and so on. The most common scale, and the most useful for the bar, is Brix, which is the measure of sucrose (table sugar) content by weight. Simple syrup with a Brix of 50 contains 50 grams of sugar in every 100-gram sample. That particular ratio is standard 1:1 simple syrup. Our rich simple syrup has a 2:1 sugar-to-water ratio and therefore a Brix of 66. Brix refractometers are a relatively cheap and easy way to standardize the syrups that you use. Want to make sure your honey syrup has the same sugar content as your simple syrup? Use a refractometer. Want to know how much sugar is in your fruit juice? Refractometer.\n\nIf you can spring for it, I recommend that you get yourself an electronic refractometer that can measure between 0 and 85 Brix. They are fast to use, even in a dark bar, and are accurate over their whole range. Traditional manual refractometers, which can be bought inexpensively, work fine. The trick with the nonelectronic jobs is making sure the Brix range they measure is sufficient. The most common range is 0–32 Brix, which is fine for any fruit juice work you do but won’t work for syrups. You can buy a 0–80 or 0–90 manual unit, but then it is hard to read accurate numbers, because the scale on a 0–90 is the same size as the scale on a 0–32, making the 0–32 almost three times more accurate. Even so, if your primary use is at the bar, get a 0–80 Brix unit (make sure it is a Brix scale and not an alcohol scale). The other issue with manual refractometers is you need a light source to read them. It sucks trying to hold a flashlight up to the end of a refractometer stuck in your eye behind a dark bar during the press of a busy service. If you are on the fence about buying one, using a Brix refractometer is also helpful outside the bar, to standardize recipes for sorbet and the like when you are using ingredients like fruit with an unknown amount of sugar (these applications want a 0–32 Brix unit).\n\nCaveat: it is extremely easy to misuse a refractometer. Brix scales assume that the only substances in your sample are sugar and water. For most products, like fruit juices, that assumption is okay because they don’t contain a lot of salt, ethanol, or other ingredients that dork with refractive index. However, using a refractometer to measure liquids that are a mixture of ingredients like oil, salt, ethanol, etc., in addition to sugar and water can lead to inaccurate readings.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "# Vanilla\n\n## Main Content\nThe odor molecule vanillin is primarily responsible for the scent we know as vanilla. Additional woody, fruity and smoky notes round out the sweet, complex aroma profile of one of the world’s most beloved spices.\n\n**Vanilla planifolia**, also known as Madagascar Bourbon vanilla, is the most commonly cultivated species. Prized for its rich, creamy and woody-balsamic notes, Bourbon vanilla is the scent most of us associate with vanilla.\n\nVanilla planifolia is an orchid species native to Mexico and Central America, where it was first cultivated and consumed by the Aztecs. Nowadays, 75 percent of the world's commercial vanilla production occurs on the islands of Madagascar and Réunion, formerly known as Île Bourbon. These vanilla orchids take three years to flower, at which point each one must be pollinated by hand. The resulting vanilla pods – or beans, as they are also called – are handpicked as they ripen and mature, changing from green to pale yellow.\n\nThe harvested pods are blanched or steamed and cured by sweating them over wool blankets. This process triggers enzymatic reactions that disrupt the cells and plant tissue, causing oxidation to take place. With the high temperature and humidity, the pod casings darken as vanillla-scented molecules develop. However, it is not the fragrance; it is the sticky brown liquid inside the characteristic vanilla swords of tiny seeds that contain the characterizing vanilla fragrance.\n\nNext, the fermented vanilla pods are dried to seal in their scent and remove excess moisture to prevent rotting. The dried pods are then transferred to boxes lined with greaseproof paper, where they are 'conditioned' for three to six months to fully develop their vanilla fragrance. The pods are then graded and separated into different categories based on their aroma and moisture content. Given the 18 months of labor-intensive cultivation and curing practices required to produce vanilla pods, it is no wonder this spice is so costly – second only to saffron.\n\n## Uses\n- Vanilla is used to sweeten and perfume everything from food and drinks (the Coca-Cola Company is one of the world’s largest consumers of vanilla) to the cosmetics and fragrances we wear. As well as being used as a flavor on its own, vanilla is often used to enhance the flavors of other foods and drinks, such as coffee and chocolate.\n  \n- **Recipe to make vanilla extract**: To make your own vanilla extract, combine 100g (3½oz) of vanilla pods (empty is fine) with 1 litre (4¼ cups) of vodka. Leave to infuse for six to eight weeks and then strain.\n\n## Related Aroma Profile: Tahitian Vanilla\nTahitian vanilla comes from the **Vanilla tahitensis** plant. It has a more perfumy scent than Bourbon vanilla, with vanilla and anise each making up 45 percent of its profile, mixed with a hint of floral.\n\n### Tahitian Vanilla Aroma Compatibility\n```plaintext\nNote: A visual aroma compatibility chart is present which provides insight into Tahitian vanilla's compatibility with various food items like horse mackerel, rocoto chili etc., using a color-coded dot system.\n```\n\n## Sidebar Summary\nA visual chart shows the \"aroma profile\" with \"floral\" as the primary attribute for Tahitian vanilla, indicating how it interacts in flavor pairings with different food items."

The wineries themselves are generally small, modest, and practical: often with dirt floors and lots of cobwebs. The tasting table may be an old board balanced between two barrels. It is almost always necessary to have an appointment, and it is greatly helpful to speak French.\n\n**In the southern Rhône**, visit the historic city of Avignon, the papal seat in the fourteenth century, and be sure to see the massive gothic palace, the Palais des Papes. In addition, the old city of Orange boasts some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in the world. Indeed, the Ancient Theater is the most intact Roman theater in the world, and the acoustics are still so perfect that the internationally acclaimed opera festival, Les Chorégies d'Orange, is held there every summer.\n\n**The Rhône Valley** is full of small country restaurants that make you feel as though you've stepped into the France of a half century ago where *la cuisine de grandmère* still deliciously dominates. And if you're in the mood to smell and \"taste\" the sea, Marseilles, and its many restaurants specializing in bouillabaisse, is less than 70 miles (110 kilometers) away from Châteauneuf."

    "contenu": "# THE FOUR BASIC FOOD MOLECULES\n\n## Water's Properties and Effects\n\n### Water is Good at Dissolving Other Substances\n\nWater's ability to form hydrogen bonds not only with itself but also with other substances that exhibit some degree of electrical polarity helps it dissolve substances effectively. This attribute arises because water molecules are smaller and more flexible compared to many other larger biomolecules like proteins which exhibit polar regions. When water molecules cluster around these larger molecules, they can isolate them, effectively dissolving them in water.\n\n### Water and Heat: From Ice to Steam\n\nWater's hydrogen bonds influence how it absorbs and transmits heat. At lower temperatures, these effects are more pronounced, impacting states from solid ice to liquid water and then to steam, all transitions governed by changes in hydrogen bonding.\n\n### Ice Damages Cells\n\nIn its solid state as ice, water can cause damage to cells due to its expansive nature when frozen. This expansion can disrupt the compact molecular packing inherited from its phase as a liquid. This phenomenon is critical in explaining why pipes burst in winter or why plants and raw meat can get damaged when frozen and subsequently thawed.\n\n### Hard Water: Dissolved Minerals\n\nHard water, which is rich in mineral ions such as calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), often found in tap water, can cause practical issues like soap scum formation and crusty precipitates. These precipitates are problematic because they can affect everything from household cleanliness (e.g., buildup on showerheads) to the taste and texture of cooked foods and the quality of baked bread. Methods to soften hard water include using filters that replace calcium and magnesium with sodium, or distilling water to remove the impurities."

They are said to sometimes have the taste of almonds, crustaceans, meat, garlic, carrots, and even of decomposing flesh.\n\n2. **Mushroom Pairings:**\n   - **Champignon & Abricot (Mushroom & Apricot):** Mushrooms can be paired with apricots in stuffings for game and poultry like turkey and quail. Beef or lamb can also be added in banquet tables. The combination is appreciated for adding an aromatic ambiance through the light flavor of the chanterelles and is especially delicious when they are freshly foraged.\n   \n   - **Champignon & Ail (Mushroom & Garlic):** Even bland mushrooms can gain intensity when cooked with aromatic ingredients like wood or field garlic. Shiitake mushrooms are especially noted for a special reaction when combined with lentinan, enhancing their umami and richness. Fresh shiitake mushrooms can be dressed with garlic slivers, olive oil, salt, and pepper for enhanced flavor before grilling or sautéing.\n   \n   - **Champignon & Aneth (Mushroom & Dill):** In Russia, a type of mushroom often found in Bordeaux can be paired with dill for an aromatic mix. These are used in small festive pastries known as pirozhki or pierogi. Dill also pairs well in mushroom dishes often served with vodka or in Thai curry dishes where dill adds a distinct touch.\n\n   - **Champignon & Anis (Mushroom & Anise):** Fresh anise can bring a welcome freshness and licorice flavor to mushrooms. It recommends creams and dill mixes for enhancing mushrooms in dishes like stroganoff. Adding anise at the start of cooking mushrooms in heated butter and oil brings out their flavors. This can also be combined with cognac and reduced before adding fresh estragon (tarragon).\n\n   - **Champignon & Asperge (Mushroom & Asparagus):** See Asperge & Champignon.\n   - **Champignon & Boeuf (Mushroom & Beef):** See Boeuf & Champignon.\n   \n   - **Champignon & Châtaigne (Mushroom & Chestnut):** Japanese Shiitake mushrooms get their name from the combination of Shinobu (a type of chestnut) and take (meaning mushroom in Japanese).

Transdanubia Region**\n   - **Szekszárd and Villány-Siklós**: Known as the two most dynamic wine regions in Hungary, these areas are highlighted for their use of modern equipment and new oak barrels. Szekszárd is renowned for red wines ideal for pairing with paprika-based dishes and produces some of the country’s best red wines. Villány-Siklós is known for full-bodied reds made from grape varieties like cabernet sauvignon, kékfrankos, merlot, and zweigelt.\n\n**2. Northern Massif**\n   - **Eger and Mátra**: Located within this region along with Tokaj-Hegyalja, Eger is famous for light-bodied reds including the popular *Egri bikavér* (\"bull’s blood\"). Mátra is recognized for its excellent white wines made from olaszrizling and yellow muscat. A local white wine variety, királyleányka, known for its aroma, is also produced here.\n\n**3. Great Alföld**\n   - This large, flat region south of Budapest encompasses more than half of Hungary's vineyards. It’s primarily known for simple, inexpensive quaffing wines based on international varieties such as chardonnay and merlot, which were planted extensively after the phylloxera disease in the 1870s and became even more widespread later.\n\n**4. General Information about Hungarian Wine Production**\n   - Historically, Hungary's wine industry was heavily influenced by state control before 1989, with the majority of wines being produced on large state-run farms. The area under vines totals about 158,000 acres, making Hungary a significant wine producer with a rich history of viticulture.\n\nThis document summarizes key Hungarian wine regions and their characteristics, showing the diversity and rich heritage of wine production in Hungary. It includes the role of modernization in enhancing the quality of production, the types of wines produced, and the impact of history on the present-day wine industry."

Here’s the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n1. **Urban Roots in Fermentation**\n   - According to Jacobs's theory, fermentation practices might not only be a rural phenomenon but have significant contributions coming from urban areas as well.\n   - Urban residents are described as vital in spurring change in rural settings by fostering demand for products and supporting community-based agricultural practices such as CSA (community supported agriculture).\n   - Urbanites and rural dwellers both engage in fermentation, and this interaction promotes both the conservation of ancient techniques and the innovation of new ones.\n\n2. **20th Century Literature on Fermentation**\n   - This literature promoted moving production from community-based and small-scale operations to more industrialized factories.\n   - This shift involved replacing traditional starter cultures passed down through generations with laboratory-bred, improved strains aiming at better hygiene, nutrition, and efficiency.\n   - It involved the introduction of Western-type beverages to different cultures which initially faced rejection, but later, adaptations of these methods became accepted after local processes were investigated and industrial methods were developed.\n\n3. **Case Study: Bantu Beer**\n   - This discusses a specific example involving the Bantu beer process.\n   - Attempts to introduce Western beverages to the Bantu people were initially rejected.\n   - Subsequent research by Clifford W. Hesseltine and Hwa L. Wang from the US Department of Agriculture Fermentation Laboratory in 1977 led to the acceptance of a modified process that was suited to modern fermentation technologies, which then produced Bantu beer that was uniform in quality and well-received. \n\nThis document illustrates the dynamics of cultural interaction, traditional practices, and modern innovations in the field of fermentation."

But Lirac does have one claim to fame: It's thought to be one of the areas where the European phylloxera epidemic began. According to John Livingstone-Learmonth, in _The Wines of the Rhône_, sometime around 1863 the innovative owner of Château de Clary decided to plant a few Californian vine cuttings to see how they'd fare in the south of France. The cuttings, unable to adapt, died. The microscopic insects (phylloxera) clinging to the cuttings' roots survived. Phylloxera destroyed the vineyards at Château de Clary and from there spread through neighboring vineyards. But phylloxera’s presence already extended beyond the southern Rhône, for at that time Europe permitted extensive importation of living plants. Also in 1863, a professor at Oxford University reported finding phylloxera in plants growing outside London. Within a few years, there were several reports of the pest in the Languedoc, and by 1869, there was evidence of phylloxera in Bordeaux.\n\nFinally, it’s interesting to note that, in the wake of phylloxera and World War I, regulations enacted in the early 1920s to improve Châteauneuf-du-Pape later became the basis for France’s monumental _Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée_ (AOC) laws.\n\n### SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCERS OF CHÂTEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE\n\nChâteau de Beaucastel • Château de la Gardine • Château La Nerthe • Château Rayas • Clos des Papes • Clos du Mont Olivet • Domaine de Beaurenard • Domaine de Chante-Perdrix • Domaine de la Charbonnière • Domaine de la Janasse • Domaine du Pégau • Font de Michelle • Le Bosquet des Papes • Le Vieux Donjon • Les Cailloux • M. Chapoutier • Vieux Télégraphe\n\n### GIGONDAS\n\nThe Gigondas vineyards cover a series of hills just below the jagged spurs of rock known as the Dentelles de Montmirail. This is the most northern of the important southern Rhône appellations. A few miles/kilometers south of it is Vacqueyras, and south of that and to the west is Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nMaybe Gigondas took its cue from the rugged Dentelles, for its wines are as strong and appealing as a firm handshake. The best have explosive raspberry, leather, and spice aromas and flavors and chewy textures. They are often characterized as robust versions of Châteauneuf, but the truth is they have an altogether different personality. To drink Gigondas is to go back to a time when great red wines were muscular—a time before winemakers knew how to soften up wine and give it polish."

    "contenu": "The document presents information about Italian wine and steak, specifically emphasizing the connection between Tuscan steak and regional wines. Here's a structured breakdown of the content within the document:\n\n---\n\n### Image Caption:\n- \"The vineyards of Marchesi de Frescobaldi, with the estate's renowned Castello di Nipozzano in the background. The Frescobaldi family, one of the original banking families of medieval Florence, has made wine for seven hundred years.\"\n\n### Section Title:\n- **STEAK ITALIAN STYLE**\n\n### Content:\n1. **Introduction to Tuscan Steak and Wine:**\n   - The text states that cabernet sauvignon commonly accompanies steak in most steak houses. However, Italian preferences, particularly in Tuscany, differ. The regional specialty, \"bistecca alla fiorentina\"—a thick slab of grilled Chianina beef—is commonly paired with a wine made from sangiovese grapes, such as Chianti Classico Riserva, brunello di Montalcino, or vino nobile di Montepulciano. These wines are admired for their bright acidity and hint of saltiness, which well complements the fatty and rich flavors of the steak.\n\n2. **Vin Santo Production:**\n   - Many families in Italy produce their own **vin santo**, a type of dessert wine, which they often use as a proud offering for guests. Beyond home production, there are several small commercial producers noted for exceptional vin santos. Mentioned producers include Avignonesi, Badia a Coltibuono, Fontodi, Isole e Olena, San Giusto a Rentennano, Selvapiana, and I Selvatici.\n   - Larger producers such as Antinori, Barone Ricasoli, Frescobaldi, and Lungarotti are highlighted for producing excellent vin santos that are widely available due to their larger production scale.\n\n---\n\nThis text not only contextualizes the culinary and vinicultural heritage of Tuscany but also provides specific examples of how traditional products are integrated into the current market. Additionally, the mention of the historical Frescobaldi family connects the contemporary practice with rich historical tradition."
