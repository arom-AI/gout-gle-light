    "contenu": "The text discusses various aspects of managing and utilizing a sourdough starter for bread baking:\n\n1. **Encouraging Yeast Activity**:\n   - The text recommends feeding the sourdough starter a significant proportion of fresh flour and water (75 to 95 percent of the starter is refreshed).\n   - This involves discarding most of the old starter and replacing it with fresh ingredients, approximately matching the volume removed.\n\n2. **Usage of Sourdough Starter in Baking**:\n   - When using sourdough in bread recipes, it is advised to use a small portion of starter, not exceeding 25 percent of the total dough. This limitation helps to control the sourness, making it a subtle flavor rather than overpowering.\n\n3. **Personal Experiences and Observations**:\n   - Initially resistant to discarding large amounts of the starter, the author has come to appreciate the benefits of this method which include better, faster, and lighter breads.\n   - The author also suggests using excess starter for making savory pancakes, indicating a practical method to avoid wastage.\n\n4. **Consistency of the Starter**:\n   - Preferences vary between maintaining the sourdough starter in a liquid state or a solid state. Each form has its pros and cons related to travel convenience, microbial activity control, and freezing potential.\n   - A solid starter is denser and thus has reduced microbial activity, which might be preferable when traveling. Freezing and drying the starter are also mentioned as methods for preservation.\n\n5. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - The text briefly touches on historical and cultural practices where immigrants preserved their sourdough starters during their journeys, either by drying or other means.\n\nThis excerpt appears to be part of a more comprehensive guide or discussion about sourdough bread making, focusing on the practical and personal aspects of maintaining a healthy and usable starter."

Nearly every house and significant grower makes a golden prestige cuvée, and several make a rosé version as well. The first prestige cuvée was made in 1876 by the house of Roederer for Czar Alexander II of Russia, who wanted an exclusive Champagne not available to (god forbid) the lower aristocracy. The czar further dictated that it be shipped in leaded crystal bottles. Roederer's prestige cuvée was hence named Cristal. Among the other well-known and exquisite prestige cuvées are Bollinger's “La Grande Année,” Perrier-Jouët's “Belle Epoque Fleur de Champagne,” Pol Roger’s “Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill,” Veuve Clicquot’s “La Grande Dame,” and Taittinger’s “Comtes de Champagne.” Note that Dom Pérignon and Krug consider all of their wines prestige cuvées. Dom Pérignon also produces Oenothèque, two rare, breathtakingly expensive bottlings—one golden, one rosé—that have been aged fifteen to thirty years on the yeast lees."

There are far fewer species of grapes, of course, but Uruguay is nonetheless one of the most exciting emerging wine regions in the Americas. Grapevines were first brought there in the 1870s by Basque immigrants, but a serious wine industry began only as of the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the country has 22,000 acres (8,900 hectares) of vineyards and 270 wineries, most of which are small and family-run and sometimes helped by one of several famous international wine consultants, among them the American Paul Hobbs, the Italian Alberto Antonini, and the Frenchman Michel Rolland.\n\nUruguay (which lies at the same latitude range as Argentina, South Africa, and Australia) has a gentle maritime climate due to its location on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. The country also boasts the purest vineyard environment in the world, according to the Environmental Sustainability Index published by Yale and Columbia Universities in the United States (Finland and Norway rank higher for total environmental purity, but good luck trying to grow grapes in either country).\n\nThe signature grape of Uruguay is tannat, a tannic grape that originated in southwest France, although today more tannat is grown in Uruguay than in the entire rest of the world. Aged in oak to soften it, tannat (whose name refers to the dark color of the grapes) can be rich and mouthfilling, with black cherry, chocolate, and espresso flavors. In Uruguay, it is considered the perfect accompaniment to the popular local asados, wood-fired barbecues devoted to Uruguay's high-quality beef. Other promising grape varieties include merlot, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, and the unusual French white variety petit manseng, which was brought to Uruguay at the same time as tannat, and makes dry, floral wines. Some of the best producers of Uruguayan wine include Stagnari, Bouza, Pizzorno, Pisano, and Juanicó.\n\n---\n\n### WHEN YOU VISIT... ARGENTINA\n\n**ASIDE FROM BEING** the best-known wine region in Argentina, Mendoza is also the most accessible and rewarding for wine-tasting experiences. You'll need a car to travel between destinations, but with so many new wineries and boutique hotels, you won't have to drive far. Many of the wineries, like Familia Zuccardi, have fantastic restaurants that specialize in Argentine cuisine."

Here's the detailed content presented in a logical structure:\n\n---\n\n### Alcohol and Carbonation\n- Alcohol requires more CO2 than water to achieve the same sensation of carbonation on the tongue. This is because CO2 is more soluble in alcohol than in water.\n- Adding alcohol to a drink can lead to excessive foaming due to more CO2 required, hence it’s advised to manage the amount of alcohol and CO2 carefully.\n\n### Managing Foam\n- To prevent drinks from spraying out foam when opened, it is important to leave enough headspace in the carbonation vessel.\n- Foaming becomes more when the alcohol content ranges between 14 and 17 percent by volume.\n- It's highlighted that one should learn from common mistakes about how much headspace to leave in the container (suggested from personal mistakes).\n\n### Sidebar on Responsible Carbonation\n- There is a reference to a sidebar discussing carbonating responsibly linked with the word \"here.\"\n\n### Example and Tips\n- An accompanying image shows the person experiencing excessive foaming from a beverage, described as a result of not following preventive measures against foam. The described scenario involves a recently agitated, poorly clarified, and warm alcoholic drink.\n\n### Heading: Finally! How to Actually Carbonate Something: Equipment and Techniques\n- The document states that it will describe three techniques for carbonation, adaptable to various equipment types. Although specific methods might become outdated, the underlying principles remain constant.\n\nThis section provides a concise examination of the document's instructional content on properly carbonating alcoholic beverages and managing the associated foam."

It explains various aspects and techniques for handling and cooking meat. I'll break down the structured content of the document:\n\n### Title\n**COOKING FRESH MEAT**\n\n### Content\n\n#### Storage\n- Discusses how water sublimation at below-freezing temperatures forms ice crystals at the meat surface, leading to dryer, white-colored meat due to the acceleration of fat and pigment loss. This degrades the texture, flavor, and color of the meat.\n\n#### Freezer Burn\n- Freezer burn is emphasized as detrimental and can be minimized by tightly wrapping the meat in water-impermeable plastic wrap.\n\n#### Thawing Meats\n- Thawing methods described:\n  - The simplest and most common way is leaving the meat on the kitchen counter; however, it's not considered safe or efficient as it allows microbial growth.\n  - A safer and more efficient method is submerging wrapped meat in cold water, allowing fast and relatively safe thawing.\n  - Using the refrigerator is safe but very slow, especially for large cuts of meat.\n\n#### Cooking Unthawed Meats\n- It is possible to cook frozen meats without thawing, especially using methods like oven roasting to evenly distribute heat without overcooking.\n\n#### Irradiation\n- Highlights the benefits of food irradiation such as damaging the DNA and proteins of disease-causing microbes, thus extending the shelf life and safety of meat.\n- Discusses controversies and consumer concerns about irradiated meat. It is claimed that irradiated meat is safe and can remain edible for three months.\n\n### Sidebar Information\n\n#### Food Irradiation\n- Commentary on the FDA approval in 1985 to control pathogens in specific meats like pork and chicken through irradiation.\n- Observations on the consumer acceptance issues due to residual tastes from irradiation and their demand for high-quality, locally produced meat.\n\n### Principles (General Mention)\n- The document also references a more detailed discussion on the principles of cooking fresh meat beginning on page 124 of the source, aiming to understand both the physical and chemical transformations in meat during cooking.\n\nThe page integrates detailed technical information directly applicable to culinary professionals or students studying food science or culinary arts, particularly focusing on the best practices for handling and preparing meat for cooking to ensure quality and safety."

Terroir is one of the organizing principles behind the fine-wine world. It is a logical concept, yet one that is surprisingly difficult to explain. Terroir sums up, in one word, all the myriad factors of geography and vineyard conditions that influence the flavor of the fruit grown in a particular place. Soil type and sun exposure, microclimate and microflora, all leave a flavor imprint on the grapes that can be perceived in the wine. Some aspects of terroir may be easily visible, such as the sunward-slope of Corton-Charlemagne. Others may be miles away from the vineyard, like the Vosges Mountains that shape the climate of Alsace.\n\nIt may sound strange to beginners, but fine wines can taste noticeably different from one vineyard to another, even when everything else is identical—grape variety and growing season, farming and winemaking. And the reverse is true as well. Two wines from the same vineyard will share a certain “family resemblance” even when made from two entirely different grape varieties. Science hasn’t yet explained exactly how it happens, but it is simply true.\n\n### Sidebar: Professional Profile of Jean-Luc Le Dû\n- **Position**: Jean-Luc Le Dû ranks among New York City’s leading wine professionals.\n- **Experience**:\n  - Former head sommelier of Daniel Boulud’s Restaurant Daniel.\n  - Built one of the best wine programs in the United States, recognized with a Wine Spectator Grand Award.\n  - Served ten years with Boulud, during which Le Dû won the title of Sopexa’s Best Sommelier of Northeast America and the James Beard Foundation Award for Outstanding Wine Service.\n- **Current Venture**: Now manages his independent venture, Le Dû’s Wines, a temperature-controlled wine store in the West Village that features artisanal winemakers and wines reflective of their terroir."

We wanted to make a vegetarian meal with a crispy crêpe as the starting point. Needing something with natural starch to bind it, we tried for macadamia nuts and a whole egg. Making something hot and crisp—and that's what starch is—always pleases even finicky kids. This crêpe batter could easily be used to coat fish or fried quenelles.\n\n**Serves: 4**\n\n## CREPE\n**Ingredients:**\n- 3 cups cooked white rice\n- 1 egg, lightly beaten\n- ¼ cup milk\n- ½ cup macadamia nuts\n- ½ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves\n- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg\n- ¼ tablespoon ground coriander\n- Kosher salt\n- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Combine 1 cup of the rice with the egg, milk, and macadamia nuts in a blender or food processor and puree until almost, but not quite, smooth (about 4 minutes in a food processor).\n2. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the remaining 2 cups of rice.\n3. Try out the batter by testing one crêpe in a hot oiled pan. You may find that you need to thin it out and if so, add more milk. Try another Crêpe.\n4. Readjust. Add the thyme, season with nutmeg, coriander, salt, and pepper and set aside.\n\n## VEGETABLES\n**Ingredients:**\n- 3 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral vegetable oil\n- 1 onion, sliced\n- ½ head Chinese cabbage (or savoy), cut into ½-inch cubes\n- 1 beefsteak tomato, sliced\n- 1 medium-sized sweet potato, peeled and shredded\n\nThe recipe provides a creative way to use leftover rice and combines the flavors of macadamia nuts and fresh herbs, complemented by a variety of vegetables, making it a fulfilling and nutritious dish."

It emphasizes various techniques and considerations for effectively destroying pathogens in compost.\n\n**Main Points:**\n\n1. **Pathogen Destruction in Compost:**\n   - High temperatures can destroy pathogens quickly in compost (referred to as \"in mere minutes\").\n   - For complete confidence in pathogen destruction:\n     * Temperatures around 65°C (150°F) may be used.\n   - More realistic temperature settings mentioned are:\n     * 50°C (122°F) for 24 hours\n     * 46°C (115°F) for a week\n   - The recommended approach involves thermophilically composting the toilet material and letting it sit undisturbed after the initial heating phase to enhance the destruction of pathogens as the compost ages.\n\n2. **Composting Techniques:**\n   - Techniques for composting can be simple and laidback, though efficient composting requires active management.\n\n3. **Societal Attitudes Towards Biological By-products:**\n   - In densely populated areas like New York City (population mentioned as eight million), the biological by-products require active management.\n   - Conventional municipal systems treat excrement as waste instead of a resource, which involves large amounts of water and chemicals, leading to additional waste issues.\n   - The document criticizes the contemporary sewage system design, which, although it mimics natural processes (like a stream), effectively converts biochemical potential into waste.\n\n4. **Reference to Expert Opinion:**\n   - Jeanette Farrell is mentioned, who describes sewage treatment as designed to do the work of a stream on a grand scale.\n\nOverall, the document encourages a reevaluation of waste management practices, promoting the use of humanure (human manure) for its potential benefits in restoring fertility to soils rather than treating it purely as waste. The text urges considering ecological and pragmatic approaches to managing human biological by-products in densely populated urban environments."

Here is a structured summary of its content:\n\n### Brining: Corned Beef and Tongue\n\n**Overview:**\n- Brining is a simple way to salt meat, turning salt into a liquid form spreads it more uniformly across the food's surface.\n- Originally meat brining served the purpose of preservation, however, nowadays it's primarily used for flavor and tenderization.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Corned beef is a well-known example of brined meat.\n- \"Corn\" historically refers to any small hard particle like grain, sand, or salt.\n- In ancient Ireland, corned beef was created by salting beef and burying it in peat bogs. This method evolved into brining.\n- Homemade corned beef, particularly from brisket, becomes very tender through brining, which also applies to tongue.\n\n**Brine Recipe:**\n- Mix a brine with approximately 10% salt and 5% sugar.\n- For each quart/liter of brine, use about 6 tablespoons of salt and 3 tablespoons of sugar.\n- This recommendation also mentions that aside from brining, dry-salted or cured meats use nitrates and nitrites for enhanced flavor, though these substances do not contribute to the tenderizing effect.\n\nOverall, the document provides practical insights into the brining process, while giving historical context to practices such as those used in preparing corned beef."

    "contenu": "**Title: HOW TO RELATE TO YOUR WINE RETAILER**\n\n**Author: ROBERT KACHER**\n*Wine Importer*\n\n---\n\n**Text Content:**\n\n**First Paragraph:**\nEvery community has different kinds of wine stores. Some are dedicated specialists that stock only wines and spirits; others are more utilitarian, such as grocery or discount stores that offer a section dedicated to wine. Even among wine-specific retailers, you can find both giant warehouses with everything under the sun and teeny storefronts featuring a narrow, carefully curated selection. In some states, only standardized government-run state stores can sell wine. But chances are, you probably have several options.\n\n**Second Paragraph:**\nUnfortunately, wine doesn’t lend itself as easily to do-it-yourself shopping as other goods. It remains one of the thorny frontiers of retail where helpful, skilled salespeople are truly invaluable. The best place to shop for wine is a place where the staff cares about wine and is available to help. Your best wine shopping resource will always be retailers who know their wares.\n\n**Third Paragraph:**\nWhen I first became interested in wine, it was considered unwise to trust wine retailers completely. The perception was that their job was to separate customers from their cash. A lot has changed over the last few decades. Americans drink more wine and are savvier shoppers; international wine quality is improving by leaps and bounds.\n\n**Sidebar:**\n**ROBERT “BOBBY” KACHER** is a high-profile importer of French wines based in Washington, D.C. He discovered a lifestyle of wine, food, and family, as well as the vineyards and kitchens of France, while backpacking in Europe during his sophomore year summer break. The lifestyle captivated him, and it grew to become an all-consuming passion. Upon returning to the United States, he worked first in retail and importing before launching his own Robert Kacher Selections in 1985. He specializes in distinctive hand-crafted French wines and has earned rave reviews for his portfolio’s remarkable values.\n\n---\n\n**Page Number:**\n77"
