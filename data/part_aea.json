    "contenu": "### UNDERSTANDING WINES: EXPLAINING STYLE AND QUALITY\n\n#### Vineyards in Alto Adige set against a mountainous backdrop.\n\n---\n\n**FRIULI-VENEZIA GIULIA**\n\nThe wine region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is located in northern Italy's eastern corner. The most northerly vineyards in the region are located in the foothills of the Alps. The climate is moderate and continental, cooled by cold air from the mountains. The vineyards in the south of the region are based on the flat plain near the Adriatic Sea and experience a warm marine climate. A large number of grape varieties are planted, producing rich, ripe white and red wines, the most prevalent being **Pinot Grigio** and **Merlot**. Friuli-Venezia Giulia produces some of the richest **Pinot Grigio** in Italy, the medium to full-bodied wines displaying juicy peach and tropical fruit flavors. Merlot is the most planted black variety, making medium-bodied wines with medium acidity and tannins and ripe red fruit flavors, often with a hint of spice from oak. The native white Friuliano is also widely grown giving wines with medium to high acidity, medium body and aromas of pear, red apples and herbs. Wines from the plain are labeled Friuli **Grave DOC**. They tend to be white, and made in a simple, fruity style. The regions of **Collio DOC** and **Colli Orientali DOC**, both located in the hills, are known for premium, more concentrated white wines with Colli Orientali also noted for its reds.\n\n**VENETO**\n\nVeneto is one of Italy’s largest wine-producing regions and home to some of its best known wines, Soave and Valpolicella. The region extends from the southern end of Lake Garda in the west to Venice in the east and ranges from the foothills of the Alps in the north to the flat plains of the Po in the south. The climate is warm with moderate rainfall. Cooling influences come from altitude, exposing the vineyards in the foothills to a large diurnal temperature range, and breezes from Lake Garda cool the vineyards in the west of the region. The flat plain is affected by moist air and fog from the River Po, increasing the number of sprays needed to combat disease and rot.\n\nThe flat fertile plain is a source of fruit for inexpensive, high volume brands growing international grape varieties such as **Pinot Grigio**, Garganega and Merlot and Italian grapes like Corvina, Chardonnay and Trebbiano. High yields mean that these wines are usually simple and fruity. They are labeled **Veneto IGT**. \n\n**Prosecco** is a sparkling wine DOC, the greater part of which is in Veneto, although some of the vineyards are located in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (for more details see Chapter 42 *Sparkling Wines of the World*).\n\n**Soave**\n\nSoave is east of Verona and has two distinct parts: foothills to the north and a flat plain in the south, near the River Po. The soils on the foothills are made up of limestone and clay with some volcanic rocks. These soils are naturally cool, and this together with the influence of altitude, slows down ripening, leading to grapes with full flavour ripening yet high acidity. The wines are capable of maturing for a number of years. The vines on the plain are planted on sandy, alluvial soils that aid ripening so"

Emulsions can separate out under heat, and delicate emulsified sauces need careful handling to maintain their structure. \n\n- **Butter in Sauces:**  \n  Butter is added to enrich and thicken sauces, but it can start to separate at higher temperatures (above 140°F/60°C). The key to maintaining an emulsion when using butter is gentle heat and proper mixing techniques.\n\n- **Beurre Blanc:**\n  A French sauce where butter is whisked into a reduction of vinegar and/or wine. It has sensitive temperature requirements to avoid separation. Ideally, the temperature should remain below 125°F/52°C during cooking to avoid separation of the emulsion.\n\n- **Beurre Monté:**\n  Prepared by blending butter with water or another liquid base such as vinegar or wine, which then serves as a poaching medium. This method limits direct exposure of proteins to high heat, allowing more gentle cooking of dishes like delicate fish or meats.\n\n- **Eggs as Emulsifiers:**\n  Egg yolks can emulsify and thicken hot sauces, developing a network that stabilizes the emulsion effectively even under heat.\n\n### Summary\nThis document provides detailed insights into different techniques and considerations for creating and maintaining stable emulsions in culinary preparations, particularly through the use of butter and eggs. Techniques such as beurre blanc and beurre monté are highlighted for their specific culinary applications and thermal sensitivities."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the use of wine in cooking and provides nuanced insight into how wine can be incorporated into different culinary techniques. Here’s a structured summary of the document's main points:\n\n**1. Cooking with Wine:**\n   - Wine is commonly used as a flavoring component in sauces and as a cooking or stewing liquid.\n   - In both applications, the majority of alcohol and water in the wine evaporates, leaving behind flavors that have little resemblance to the original wine.\n\n**2. Pairing Wine with Dishes:**\n   - It is suggested to cook with the same wine that one intends to serve, though finding an exact match is not always necessary.\n   - Experimentation by cooking a cup each of two different wines and comparing the outcomes in sauces can be an engaging activity for guests.\n\n**3. Influence of Wine on Cooked Dishes:**\n   - The transformation of the dish's flavors is more noticeable when the dish is stewed for longer periods.\n   - There is no need to use expensive wines for cooking; a simple tasty red table wine can suffice, especially if the dish will be stewed.\n\n**4. Selection of Wine for Cooking:**\n   - The flavor components of the wine become a part of the dish. The choice between using a fine wine versus a wine being served with the meal depends on the intended outcome.\n   - Off-dry or sweet wines and wines with high oak or tannin levels can significantly affect the taste, possibly introducing unwanted bitterness or sweetness.\n\n**5. Marinating and Macerating:**\n   - Both techniques involve using uncooked wine which is then either cooked with the food or used as a marinating liquid.\n   - While marinating, foods are soaked in wine, enhancing flavors through the incorporation of spices, herbs, and other seasonings. This method can overshadow the wine's flavors but adds complexity and depth to the dish.\n   - With maceration, the aim is similar, but the technique typically involves less intense flavor alteration.\n\n**6. Cooking Tips:**\n   - For marinating, using a better wine can add more complex flavor to the dish.\n   - Marinating is usually intended for meat but can also be applied to fish or poultry.\n\nThis document provides valuable culinary advice on how to effectively use wine in cooking to enhance the flavor of dishes, debunking the notion that only high-quality wines are suitable for cooking and encouraging creative culinary experimentation."

    "contenu": "# KOSHER WINE\n\nThe word *kosher* means “fit,” thus, in Jewish tradition, kosher wines are considered fit to drink. There are two types—non-mevushal and mevushal.\n\n## Types of Kosher Wine\n\n- **Non-mevushal kosher wine** must be made, handled, bottled, certified, opened, poured, and drunk only by Sabbath-observant Jews. If a non-Jew touches the wine, the wine loses its non-mevushal kosher status, is considered unfit for sacramental use, and will be rejected by strict observant Jews, who will not drink it. The second, and far more common type of kosher wine is mevushal (literally, “cooked”).\n- **Mevushal wines** are made like non-mevushal wines, with one exception—they are pasteurized and can therefore be bought, opened, and shared among Jews and non-Jews, as well as non-observant Jews and observant Jews.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nReligious scholars speculate that the reason for the two types goes far back in history. Traditionally, of course, Jewish religious authorities knew that wine was used not just for sacramental purposes, but also socially. Wine eased and encouraged social interaction. It's thought that early Jewish intellectuals may have feared such socializing, viewing it as the first step toward the disintegration of Jewish culture and the assimilation of Jews into other cultures. To mitigate against this, two versions of kosher wine would be made.\n\n## Winemaking in the United States\n\nUntil recently in the United States, the wines were also produced from foxy-tasting native grapes, such as Concord (of jelly fame). Such grapes thrived along the East Coast, where the largest centers of Jewish population were to be found. Over time, American-made kosher wine became inextricably linked with low-quality, syrupy-sweet wines that tasted like adult Kool-Aid.\n\n## Modern Kosher Winemaking\n\nToday kosher wines—non-mevushal and mevushal—are in an entirely different league, and compete with fine wines made anywhere in the world. They are made around the world from classic European grape varieties, such as cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Importantly, mevushal wines are no longer boiled, but flash pasteurized—a gentler form of sterilization—and the wine is then aged. According to **KosherWine.com**, a leading kosher wine retail site, as of 2010, annual sales of kosher wine in the United States alone had a value of approximately $45 million.\n\n## Influence of Oak in Winemaking\n\nThe impact oak has on wine depends, among other things, on the type of oak used. Of the approximately three hundred species of oak that grow around the world, just three main types are used in winemaking: the American oak *Quercus alba* (mainly from the Midwest) and the French oaks *Quercus robur* and *Quercus sessiliflora* (also called *Quercus petraea*).\n\n### Characteristics of Different Oaks\n\n- **American oak:** Imparts to wine heavier, denser, and less porous flavors which tends to be less tannic and have more pronounced vanilla and sometimes coconut-like flavors.\n- **French oak:** More subtle in terms of flavor, somewhat more tannic, allows for slightly greater—but still gentle—oxidation.\n\n### Experimentation and Selection\n\nWine makers generally age small lots of their wines experimentally in many different oak barrels representing different oak species, different forests, and a variety of coopers, and then decide which ones work best.\n\n## Aging of Barrels\n\nThe age of the barrels also matters. A winemaker can choose to put a wine into new barrels, used barrels, or a combination of new and used barrels. Sometimes used barrels are euphemistically referred to as seasoned barrels—as in a \"seasoned\" person."

    "contenu": "## COMPARING NONVINTAGE, VINTAGE, AND PRESTIGE CUVÉES\n\nNonvintage Champagnes differ from vintage and prestige cuvée Champagnes in a number of ways, detailed below.\n\n### VINEYARDS\n\n- **In Champagne**: \n  - Some forty-two villages (and all of the vineyards in them) are considered superior and are ranked Premier Cru.\n  - Seventeen more villages (and the vineyards within those) carry an even higher status: Grand Cru.\n\n- **NONVINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Grapes come from good vineyards (neither Premier Cru nor Grand Cru) although some Premier Cru wine may be blended in.\n\n- **VINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Grapes come from good to great vineyards, many of which are ranked Premier Cru or Grand Cru.\n\n- **PRESTIGE CUVÉE**: \n  - Grapes come from the greatest vineyards, historically, ranked Grand Cru exclusively.\n\n### GRAPES\n\nMost Champagnes are a blend of chardonnay, pinot noir, and pinot meunier. However, because pinot meunier is usually not as capable of long aging as chardonnay and pinot noir, some houses prefer to use it only in nonvintage Champagnes, which tend to be drunk early, not cellared for many years.\n\n- **NONVINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Pinot meunier is almost always included in the blend.\n\n- **VINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**:\n  - Pinot meunier is sometimes included in the blend.\n\n- **PRESTIGE CUVÉE**: \n  - For most—but not all—houses, pinot meunier is rarely included in the blend.\n\n### BLENDING\n\nAll Champagnes are blends. Blending, in fact, is considered the most critical skill a Champagne maker must possess.\n\n- **NONVINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Dozens—sometimes hundreds—of still wines are used, from several different years.\n\n- **VINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Dozens of still wines are used, from a single year that was considered exceptional.\n\n- **PRESTIGE CUVÉE**: \n  - A blend of only the best wines from the best vineyards to which the producer has access.\n\n### AGING ON THE YEASTS\n\n- **NONVINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Fifteen months sur lie.\n\n- **VINTAGE CHAMPAGNE**: \n  - Three years sur lie.\n\n- **PRESTIGE CUVÉE**: \n  - No requirement; common practice is four to ten years sur lie.\n\n---\n\nFollowing the blending process, the nonvintage blend will be mixed with a small amount of yeasts and a liqueur de tirage—a combination of sugar and wine—and then bottled and capped. The yeasts consume the sugar in a second fermentation process, producing more alcohol and CO2. When bottles are capped, the CO2 cannot escape and remains physically trapped in the wine as dissolved gas. Upon opening the bottles, this gas explosively releases, creating the characteristic effervescence of champagne."

    "contenu": "The document concerns the aroma profile of the Picual black olive, a variety typically fermented using a Greek method of brining with only salt and water. This cultivation technique leads to noticeable changes as the olives ripen and darken – they lose much of their initial green scent while developing a richer profile with green-fatty and fried notes, complimented by fruity-peach and selenium aromas. This results in a characteristic sharpness mixed with subtle smoky, cheesy notes and a hint of olive-like scent.\n\n**Flavor Profile Visualization:**\nThe flavor components of the Picual black olive are represented in a circular graphic where each segment stands for different aroma categories associated with the olive. These include:\n\n1. **Nutty:** Hazelnut, Toasted\n2. **Green:** Green, Fatty, Fried, Leafy, Salty\n3. **Fruity:** Peach, Jasmine\n4. **Mushroom:** Forest, Earthy\n5. **Cheese:** Cheesy, Caramel, Butter\n6. **Spicy/Hot:** Black Pepper\n7. **Smoky:** Smoky\n8. **Animal:** Sulphuric\n9. **Others:** Potato, Olive\n\nThe aromas are tagged with colors varying from light orange to purple depending on their intensities and characters.\n\n**Textual Explanation:**\nThe text below the graphic explains the transformation of the olive's aroma as it ages, emphasizing the minor production of acids and the overriding scent changes marked by the fruit's ripening process. There's specific mention of new volatile molecules forming, which add to the layered scent profile of the Picual black olive.\n\n**Flavor Pairing Examples:**\nAdjacent to the aroma chart, the document includes a table of flavors that pair effectively with Picual black olives:\n\n- **Orange Peel**\n- **Cow's Milk Mozzarella**\n- **Cantaloupe**\n- **Grilled Lamb**\n- **Roasted Hazelnut**\n- **Pan-fried Quail**\n- **Boiled Brown Crab**\n- **Dark Soy Sauce**\n- **Mint**\n- **Boiled Potato**\n\nThese pairing suggestions illustrate the versatility of Picual black olives in culinary contexts, showing how their unique flavor profile can complement and enhance a variety of dishes, both sweet and savory. Each pairing suggestion is color-coded to visually correspond with the degrees of compatibility or typical usage, ranging from frequent (dark dots) to rare (light dots)."

The author highlights the specific quantity of lime leaves added to recipes and appreciates the flavor combination of turmeric and lime leaf."

Unfortunately, these muddlers are better left on your mantle and out of your cocktail shaker.\n \nFor starters, most wooden muddlers are too short to do the job: once you have them in a mixing glass or shaking tin, there’s not enough handle sticking out to hold. The coating on a varnished muddler will eventually chip or peel, and varnish isn’t an ingredient we like to put in our drinks. Unvarnished wooden muddlers also have their shortcomings. The wood can also chip off during use. Plus, untreated wood likes to soak up whatever it touches and takes its time to dry, thereby creating a petri dish type of environment for fun bacterial experiments.\n \nThat’s not to say you should run the other way when you encounter a wooden muddler. We have a couple of them in our arsenal at Death & Co, but we’re careful to regularly clean and oil them.\n\nAnother popular style of muddler features a steel handle and a plastic bottom dotted with small spikes. These are practically useless, as the nubs tend to shred herbs, and ingredients often get caught up in them—and if you’re muddling four raspberries, you don’t want two sticking to the muddler.\n\nOur favorite muddlers at Death & Co are as inelegant as they come: heavy black PVC cylinders that look like short nightsticks or menacing S&M props. They’re heavy enough to do most of the work for you, which is much appreciated after an eight-hour shift. Also, they have a flat bottom with sharp edges, allowing you to efficiently break up and blend ingredients."

First, I will provide the description part and then present the list of ingredients in a structured format.\n\n**Description:**\nFor the hickory broth, the process involves smoking hickory chips, wrapping them in cheesecloth along with juniper berries and peppercorns, and then submerging them in water to create a broth. This method results in a smoked sauce that is light and tasty, termed a \"wood stock,\" which complements smoked salmon. Adjustments such as adding water to cut the wood and smoke flavor or reducing the mixture to intensify it may be necessary. The finish involves using half-and-half, and foaming it with a handheld mixer.\n\n**Ingredients List:**\n\n- CHIVES (garnish)\n- cilantro\n- cinnamon\n- citrus\n- cloves\n- coconut: shredded, milk\n- cognac\n- coriander\n- corn\n- cornichons\n- crab\n- CREAM, HEAVY\n- cream cheese\n- crème fraîche\n- cucumbers\n- cumin\n- curry: leaves, powder, sauce (esp. red)\n- daikon\n- dill\n- eggs: hard-boiled, scrambled\n- fennel\n- fennel seeds\n- fenugreek seeds\n- GARLIC\n- ginger: fresh\n- grapefruit: juice, zest\n- greens, bitter\n- horseradish\n- juniper berries\n- kelp\n\nThese are the ingredients listed in the document, useful for culinary preparations, especially for the described hickory broth."

Wild mushrooms are noted as sublime.\n- **Cheeses:** Its rustic personality and racy acidity make Sangiovese suitable for a wider range of cheeses than most other red wines, especially milder blue-veined cheeses like Gorgonzola and Cambozola.\n\n**Sangiovese Isn't Good With:**\n- **Spicy and hot dishes:** The fiery spice can disrupt the balance of flavors in Sangiovese-based wines.\n- **Seafood:** Particularly \"red-friendly\" fish like tuna, swordfish, and salmon are not recommended pairings due to Sangiovese not being a sure bet with shellfish and fish species.\n  \n**When Selecting Wine:** \n- Choosing Sangiovese with various food pairings requires careful consideration of the wine's personality and its affinity for specific foods. For instance, \"Super Tuscan\" blends, which might contain a higher percentage of Cabernet, could be treated more like a Cabernet Sauvignon rather than like a traditional Sangiovese. \n\nThis information is helpful in diversifying wine selections and culinary combinations to ensure harmonious dining experiences."
