The text details various methods and principles related to the perpetuation and usage of fermentation cultures or starters. Below is a structured summary of the content:\n\n### Fermentation Types and Methods\n- **Contrasting Styles of Fermentation:**\n  - One type described is \"wild fermentation,\" introduced in a previous book, involving spontaneous usage of environmental organisms.\n  - The other type is the \"culturing\" method where specific isolated organisms or established communities are introduced intentionally to substrates to initiate fermentation, referred to as 'culturing.'\n\n### Fermentation Cultures (Starters)\n- **Definition and Function:**\n  - Referred to as starters, these cultures involve transferring a small amount of active or mature ferment to a fresh batch of food nutrient (substrate) to continue the process.\n  - This process is termed as 'backslopping.' \n\n### Perpetuation of Fermentation Cultures\n- **Development from Natural Processes:**\n  - Initially, these cultures began as wild fermentation events, which were then developed and refined based on favorable results.\n  - Examples include yogurt and sourdoughs, perpetuated by backslopping.\n\n### Special Cultures\n- **Self-Reproducing Cultures:**\n  - Certain starters evolve into unique biological forms that reproduce themselves as cohesive communities.\n  - Example given is Kefir, described as \"rubbery blobs\" containing a mix of polysaccharides, bacteria, and fungi; and Kombucha which uses a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY).\n\n### Maintenance of Cultures\n- **Requirement for Regular Feeding:**\n  - The text specifies that to maintain a culture, it must be regularly fed with its specific requisite substrate, like milk for yogurt and kefir, flour or other forms of grains for sourdoughs, and sweet tea for kombucha.\n\n### References\n- A reference to \"Fermentation and Culture in chapter 1\" is noted for further details on culturing.\n\nThis structured content extracts and summarizes key points on fermentation cultures from the provided document image for clearer understanding and reference."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various features and techniques regarding the preparation of meringues and royal icing. Here’s the extracted content:\n\n### Cooked Meringues\nCooked meringues require more effort to make compared to uncooked ones due to the process of cooking that involves heat, which sets the albumen proteins and limits the trapping of air. They have several benefits including:\n- Sugar, being more soluble in hot liquid, can dissolve better, which helps in absorbing more moisture and making the meringue less brittle when dried.\n- The meringue can remain stable without separating for longer periods.\n- Safety concerns related to raw eggs are addressed, as the cooking process is generally sufficient to kill salmonella bacteria.\n\n### Types of Cooked Meringues\n1. **Italian Meringue**: Involves boiling sugar separately with water up to certain temperatures before adding to whipped egg whites. This recipe results in a fluffy, fine-textured meringue, good for pastries decorating.\n   \n2. **French Meringue (Meringue cuite)**: Egg whites and sugar are beaten together and then cooked to create a stable, dense foam. This cooked meringue can be refrigerated for several days and used for decorative purposes.\n\n### Meringue Problems\nMeringue can sometimes experience issues like weeping or becoming gritty and sticky due to:\n- Sugar not completely dissolving, forming beads of syrup or crystals.\n- Overbeaten foams leading to an unsightly texture.\n- High oven temperatures speeding the crystallization process, affecting the texture.\n\n### Royal Icing\nRoyal Icing, used for decorative pastry work, is made by whipping together powdered sugar and egg white. The icing forms a dense foam and a paste-like mixture, with much of the sugar remaining undissolved for a fine texture.\n\nThis structured content gives an understanding of how meringues and royal icing are prepared, the precautions needed during the process, and common issues that may arise."

The emphasis on centralization and industrial-scale production can be mitigated by localizing the malting process.\n\n#### Recent Trends\n- **Decentralized Malting**: Recent years have seen a shift towards decentralized malting operations, particularly in remote regions. This supports local agriculture and reduces reliance on monocultures.\n- **Local-Food Revival**: There is increasing interest in integrating grain growing with local food movements, which helps in diversifying agriculture and enhances the local food economy.\n\n#### DIY Malting Process\n1. **Starting Material**: Begin with whole, unhulled barley that includes the outer husk.\n2. **Ideal Conditions**: Malt barley at a temperature between 55-60°F (13-16°C).\n3. **Preparation**: Do not harvest the barley too freshly or too dry. Store it for at least six weeks before starting the malting process.\n4. **Soaking**: \n   - Cover barley with water and allow it to soak for around eight hours.\n   - Chaff will rise to the top, which should be removed after the initial soak.\n   - If needed, replenish with more water.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe document emphasizes the feasibility and advantages of localized malting to both deepen understanding of brewing and support local economies through agricultural diversification."

Our profession had been underequipped for decades because the once-thriving barware industry (not to mention the craft of making cocktails) largely disappeared during Prohibition and has since struggled to rebuild itself. However, even though our trade toiled in the cocktail Dark Ages throughout the second half of the twentieth century, American cocktail culture (and its tools) did find its way to other parts of the world, most notably Japan, where it flourished, evolved, and begat its own arsenal of neoclassical gear. These amazing Japanese bar tools, made specifically for cocktails (as opposed to kitchen tools repurposed for cocktail use), spawned an industry-wide fascination with Japanese technique that’s still going strong."

In the past, it was the white grape blended into Chianti in small amounts to lighten it. Now it is the grape best known for vin santo, the famous Tuscan dessert wine.\n- **SAUVIGNON BLANC:** Limited amounts are grown, but wines made from this grape show promise.\n- **TREBBIANO:** Technically, trebbiano Toscano. Formerly used with malvasia in Chianti, and now used for vin santo as well as for dry white wines generally of neutral character.\n- **VERNACCIA:** Makes Tuscany’s most traditional, simple white wine; grown around the hill town of San Gimignano.\n\n## REDS:\n- **CABERNET SAUVIGNON:** Often a significant part of the blend in Carmignano, and sometimes blended in very tiny amounts with sangiovese to make contemporary Chianti and Chianti Classico. It is the sole grape variety or a component in some Super Tuscan wines.\n- **CANAIOL0:** Historically the second red grape, besides sangiovese, in the traditional Chianti blend.\n- **COLORINO:** One of the historic blending grapes in the traditional Chianti blend. Contributes structure and a deep color (much as petit verdot does in a Bordeaux blend).\n- **MERLOT:** Sometimes blended in small amounts with sangiovese to make contemporary Chianti and Chianti Classico. Also used in a limited number of Super Tuscans.\n- **SANGIOVESE:** The major Tuscan grape used for all the important traditional red wines of the region—Chianti, Chianti Classico, brunello di Montalcino, and vino nobile di Montepulciano.\n\n### Additional Information:\nSangiovese, characterized as an exacting, troublesome grape, doesn't ripen uniformly and presents cultivation challenges due to its sensitivity to varying conditions. It also produces unevenly ripe bunches which can impair the quality of wine. Italy has undertaken significant clonal research, particularly with Sangiovese, leading to the registration and naming of several superior clones known as \"Chianti Classico 2000\" for their quality and resistance."

    "contenu": "### HOW DRY IS THAT CHAMPAGNE?\n\nAfter the yeasts are removed from each bottle, Champagnes may be topped up with sweetened reserve wine, or liqueur d’expédition. The number of grams of sugar in this liqueur—known as the dosage—will determine the category of Champagne made.\n\nThe vast majority of Champagnes now produced are brut (less than 1.2 percent sugar), and some Champagnes (known as dosage zero) have no added sugar whatsoever. As for the categories sec, demi-sec, and doux—while they are treasured in some countries, these Champagnes are increasingly rare, and constitute only a tiny percentage of the Champagnes now made.\n\nBelow are the categories of Champagne based on their dosage. Keep in mind that, relative to, say, a luscious dessert wine, no Champagne today is extremely sweet. Sauternes, for example, often contains 120 grams of sugar per liter, making it 12 percent sugar.\n\n| Category      | Sugar Content (grams per liter) | Percentage Sugar |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n| BRUT NATURE   | less than 3                     | .3 percent        |\n| EXTRA BRUT    | 0 to 6                          | 0 to .6 percent   |\n| BRUT          | less than 12                    | less than 1.2 percent |\n| EXTRA-DRY     | 12 to 17                        | 1.2 to 1.7 percent |\n| SEC           | 17 to 32                        | 1.7 to 3.2 percent |\n| DEMI-SEC      | 32 to 50                        | 3.2 to 5 percent   |\n| SWEET         | more than 50                    | 5 percent          |\n\nThe process begins with the harvest. To ensure elegance in the final wine, the grapes must be harvested gently and quickly by hand so that the juice doesn’t pick up any tannic coarseness from the skins. The grapes are often therefore not transported to a winery to be pressed, but rather pressed right in the vineyard in some two thousand pressing houses. Each lot of grapes is kept separate.\n\nIn most cases, the juice is fermented in stainless steel vats, which allows the winemaker to control the temperature and pace of the fermentation and completely inhibits oxidation. However, a few houses (notably Krug, Bollinger, Louis Roederer, and Jacquesson) still ferment some of their wines in used wooden barrels, as was historically done. Champagnes that have been fermented in barrels often take on a slight nuttiness and a fuller mouthfeel as a result of slight oxygen exposure. And since the barrels are never even close to new, there is never any oak flavor. After fermenting their wines, most producers (but not all) will put those wines through malolactic fermentation to soften the impression of the wines’ acidity.\n\nThe actual number of separate lots of base wine can be astounding. A typical house, for example, will have hundreds of separate lots of base wines available for use. The largest house, Moët & Chandon has some eight hundred separate base wines available for use each year."

Below is a structured summary that categorizes and encapsulates the information provided about each meat type:\n\n### European Beef \n- **Preferences**: European countries like their beef from younger cattle, typically slaughtered at 16-18 months with some exceptions like the British beef coming from older, several years old cattle.\n- **French Specifics**: Due to disease prevention (BSE), French beef comes from cattle less than 30 months old.\n  \n### Japanese Beef\n- **Specialty**: Known for its \"shimofuri\" (highly marbled beef), best exemplified by the Wagyu breed.\n- **Preparation**: Wagyu cattle are slaughtered at 24-30 months, with heifers often fattened further for improved marbling. The beef is served often in sushi or \"sukiyaki\" and \"shabu shabu,\" which involves thinly sliced meat.\n  \n### Veal\n- **Characteristics**: Veal comes from young male dairy cows, valued for its pale and delicate flavor. The meat becomes tougher and more beef-like as the calf ages.\n  \n### Sheep and Lamb\n- **Historical Context**: Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated.\n- **Meat Characteristics**: Meat breeds of sheep are rare in Europe, and mutton and lamb are prized for their flavor, which varies depending on factors like diet and age. \n\n### Lamb and Mutton\n- **Varieties and Flavor**: Lamb is finer and more tender, often having a characteristic odor which intensifies with the animal's pasture-feeding on things like alfalfa and clover. \n- **Aging and Slaughter**: In New Zealand, lamb is slaughtered young but aged longer, staying tender. In France and America, mutton and lamb undergo a brief aging process.\n\nThis summary collapses the details into digestible classifications about beef, veal, sheep, lamb, and mutton, touching on aspects of preferred age for slaughter, feeding habits, cultural preferences, and meat characteristics as noted in each section within the text."

In Japan and elsewhere in Asia, sweets often include the seaweed extract agar which is effective in unusually small amounts (as little as 0.1% of the mix).\n\n#### Turkish Delight\n- **Turkish delight** or *lokum rabat* in Turkish, is one of the most venerable of this kind, having been made in the Middle East and the Balkans for centuries. It’s thickened with starch (around 4%), translucent, and traditionally flavored with essence of rose.\n\n#### Licorice\n- **Licorice:** Usually made with wheat flour and molasses, approximately 30% and 60% of the mix respectively, and supplemented with licorice extract around 5%. It's often flavored with anise and has a curious tradition in Scandinavian countries pairing licorice with ammonia—an aroma usually encountered in overripe cheeses.\n\n#### Jelly Beans and Gummy Candies\n- **Jelly Beans and Gummy Candies:** Favorites made with approximately equal weights of sucrose and corn syrup, and a mixture of gelatin and pectin. The gelatin may be between 5 and 15% of the candy weight, by itself producing an increasingly elastic, even rubbery texture. Adding about 1% pectin introduces a complex microstructure into the candy, giving a shorter, more crumbly texture and also causing candy tastes and aromas to seem more intense. Gelatin is degraded in high heat, so a concentrated solution is added to the sugar syrup after it has been cooked and mostly cooled. These candies typically contain about 15% water.\n\n#### Marzipan\n- **Marzipan:** Typically a paste of sugar and almonds, it has been made in the Middle East and Mediterranean region for centuries. Marzipan is especially prized as a sculptural material; it’s shaped and colored to resemble fruits and vegetables, animals, people, and many other objects. Formed by finely granulated sugar and blended with nut proteins and carbohydrates, marzipan can be cooked with almonds and sugar to produce the final product.\n\n#### Fizzy and Crackling Candies\n- **Fizzy and Crackling Candies:** Developed in the 19th century, embedding the equivalent of baking powder in a very low-moisture sugar syrup as it cools and hardens. Reminders of how baking powder functionality as a mixture of an acid together with alkaline baking soda. When two components are moistened together in a candy, they react to produce foaminess filled with carbon dioxide bubbles. Notably, a 20th-century industrial innovation known as Pop or Space Rocks, which instantly burst and then disappear in the mouth, were crafted by charging concentrated sugar syrup with carbon dioxide, then freeze drying under pressure to lock the gas within the solidified candy."

We tend to define aroma as something we sniff with the nose, and taste as something perceived with the tongue. But biologically speaking, taste buds are limited in the messages they can transmit. Alone, they can detect the presence of only a handful of characteristics on contact: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (the “yum” taste of glutamates). Aroma is responsible for delivering much of what we describe as “taste,” that is, the complex flavors of food and wine.\n\nIt’s natural for the brain to locate flavor as being present in the mouth, of course, since the sensation occurs when we sip a beverage or bite into food. And for everyday wine drinking, it hardly matters which sensory organ perceives what. The olfactory sensations responsible for wine flavor blend seamlessly with taste and tactile sensations to form our experience of wine as a whole.\n\nUnderstanding how taste and smell work together is not truly required for enjoying wine. But if we want to communicate about wine style and flavor—to decipher wine reviews or read labels—then knowing the difference between taste and scent is extremely useful. Identifying [...]\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Ann C. Noble,** professor emerita of enology at the University of California at Davis, is best known for the creation of the Wine Aroma Wheel, a popular tool for developing descriptive wine vocabulary. Professor Noble taught courses and conducted research in sensory evaluation of wine for the university's Department of Viticulture and Enology. She is now consulting, teaching short courses, and presenting seminars on wine sensory evaluation in the United States and abroad. She also serves as a wine judge in national and international wine shows. The Wine Aroma Wheel is available online in many languages.\n\n---\n\n**WINE TASTING 49**\n\n---\n\nThis document seems to provide an educational overview on the sensory aspects of wine tasting, emphasizing the importance of both taste and aroma in the experience, and introduces Dr. Ann C. Noble and her contributions to the field."

Here's a breakdown of its structured content:\n\n### The Curdling Specialist\n1. **Rennet's Role in Cheesemaking**:\n   - Traditional rennet is derived from the fourth stomach of a milk-fed calf less than 30 days old.\n   - Rennet contains chymosin which is critical in cheesemaking because it selectively targets and coagulates specific proteins in milk, turning them into a solid mass known as curd.\n\n2. **Role of Acidity**:\n   - Acetic acid causes the milk to release casein micelles and proteins by dispersing calcium.\n   - High acidity is required to ensure casein in milk curdles efficiently.\n\n### Cheese Microbes\n1. **Decomposition and Recomposition in Cheeses**:\n   - Cheeses undergo decomposition and recomposition facilitated by various microbes, contributing to the flavor and texture of the cheese.\n   \n2. **Types of Starter Bacteria**:\n   - **Lactic acid bacteria**: Initially acidify the milk, helping drain and flavor it during cheese ripening.\n   - **Thermophilic bacteria**: Used in cooking step for some cheeses, contributing uniquely to the flavor because of their resistance to higher temperatures.\n   - **Starter cultures**: Made differently; some are created from the whey of the previous batch maintaining traditional flavors.\n\n### True \"Vegetable Rennets\" from Thistle Flowers\n- **Historical context**: It has been known since Roman times that thistles can curdle milk.\n- **Use in Cheesemaking**:\n  - In Portugal and Spain, wild cardoon thistles (`Cynara cardunculus` and `Cynara humilis`) are used to make distinct cheeses like Serra, Serpa, and Azeitão.\n  - Thistle flowers induce curdling but also may impart a bitter taste to the cheeses.\n\nThis structure covers the key elements of cheesemaking discussed in the document, including the sources and functions of rennet and bacteria, and acknowledges an alternative method using thistles."

This preference has excluded many good cocktail apples from popularity.\n\n2. **Impact on Apple Varieties and Quality:**\n   - Traditional growing of heirloom varieties in America leans towards selecting only crunchy apples. Many of these apples are harvested before they develop richer, mature flavors or sugars. This premature picking results in underripe, firm apples that lack the desired flavors for juicing.\n\n3. **Challenges with Early-season Apples:**\n   - Early-season apples, which tend to be crunchier, are considered worse for juicing as they become mushy faster than other types and are often picked before developing deeper flavors.\n\n4. **Consumer Indifference to Texture in Cocktails:**\n   - Despite the focus on juicing apples for cocktails, consumers generally do not concern themselves with the texture of the apple as much as with the flavor and juice quality. However, there is an emphasis on encouraging local growers to select ripe apples for better quality produce.\n\n5. **Choosing the Right Apple Based on Visual and Sensory Cues:**\n   - It is suggested to note how the knife feels cutting through an apple, use this sensation to judge the ripeness and suitability for juicing.\n   - Observing the color changes in apples can also indicate ripeness, with some apples getting darker or developing a blush.\n   - The range of flavors can vary within a tree based on sunlight exposure and branch growth, indicating that even within the same apple variety, the flavor can differ significantly.\n\n6. **Technique for Testing Apple Flavor:**\n   - To better understand the flavor profile of an apple, examine one side of the apple that appears more colored or has more blush, and taste it starting from the side that is farthest from this coloration to get a better assessment of its overall flavor quality.\n\nThis document raises awareness about the broader implications of apple texture and maturity on the quality of juice used in cocktails, suggesting a more nuanced approach to selecting and appreciating apples based on these factors."

    "contenu": "The document discusses various aspects related to fish and shellfish, focusing on their freshness, handling post-catch, recognition of freshness, rigor mortis, and methods of killing and preserving freshness.\n\n### The Effects of Rigor Mortis and Time\n\n- **Timing and Freshness**: Fish are sometimes eaten just minutes or hours after capture, and their quality is affected by the onset of rigor mortis. This natural stiffening occurs soon after death but can vary based on factors like the fish's struggle and fat content.\n  \n- **Cultural Practices**: \n  - In Japan, some people enjoy slices of fish that are so fresh they still twitch (\"**ikizukuri**\").\n  - In Norway, fresh fish like cod are stored alive and only killed right before cooking, referred to as \"**blodfersk**\" (or \"blood-fresh\").\n  - Chinese restaurants may also practice killing fish just before cooking to ensure freshness.\n\n### Recognizing Fresh Fish\n\n- **Consumer Awareness**: Many consumers lack knowledge about the origin and handling of fish, which affects their ability to select high-quality seafood.\n  \n- **Quality Indicators**:\n  - Visual and smell cues suggest freshness but may not always indicate the best quality.\n  - Ideally, fish should be caught after spawning for superior quality.\n  \n- **Recommended Approach**:\n  - Find knowledgeable and reliable fish merchants who understand the seasonal quality of fish.\n  - Prefer merchants who are selective about their supplies to avoid older stock.\n\n### Handling Freshly Killed Fish\n\n- **Processing**: It is advisable to properly process freshly killed, pre-rigor mortis fish by cutting into steaks or fillets.\n  \n- **Freezing Considerations**: \n  - Quickly freezing the fish pieces helps avoid quality degradation due to rigor mortis.\n  - Slow thawing minimizes muscle contraction and helps retain the fish's shape by preventing severe ice crystal formation that can lead to a degraded texture.\n\nThe document extensively covers how freshness and handling after capture influence the quality of fish and shellfish, offering practical advice for selecting and preparing seafood."
