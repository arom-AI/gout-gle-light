The contemporary interest in modern, nonnative varietals has meant that Chardonnay and other international grapes have begun to supplant local Piedmontese grapes like Arneis (and Erbaluce), but fortunately several committed producers are ensuring that we will have this great grape and its unique wines for years to come. For me, Arneis is one of the white wines that really hits its mark, so let’s help them spread the word!\n\n**Alternative Names:** \n- Barolo Bianco (Italy)\n\n**Styles:**\n- Medium-bodied dry white\n\n**Sometimes Blended With:** \n- Other local grapes (only occasionally and for locally distributed wines)\n\n**Flavor Lexicon:**\n- **Fruit/vegetable:** Green melon, lemon, lime, pear, raw almond \n- **Floral:** Anise, flower blossom, fresh herbs \n- **Earth:** Chalk, mineral \n- **Other:** Light honey\n\n**Similar Wines:**\n- Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc without the grassy elements, and Pinot Blanc from Alsace or Italy\n\n**Where It’s Grown:**\n- Australia (Victoria), Italy (Piedmont), U.S.A. (California, Oregon)\n\nThe Arneis grape is closely associated with its native home of Roero, in Italy’s northeast Piedmont region. Here, where it’s called Arneis di Roeri, the grape truly shines. An increasing quantity of it is being planted, but it’s still dwarfed by the seas of Moscato from nearby Asti and the augmented planting of other grapes. Almost extinct in the mid-1970s, it has found new life as more consumers have discovered its charms: it’s a clean, perfumed white wine, void of any pretension. Its unique combination of spring flowers, aromatic herbs, and a distinct minerality can be charming.\n\n**Global Trends:**\n- Although in Italy Arneis is grown only in Piedmont, the growing global interest in aromatic white wines continues.\n\n**Page Number:** 39"

Asparagus does not destroy the flavor of wine as might be presumed. Instead, it complements well with white wines that possess herbal, green aromas like Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and Austrian Grüner Veltliner.\n\n2. **Pairing Wines with Vinegar-Heavy Dishes:**\n   - For dishes where vinegar is a dominant flavor, which often occurs in salads and pickles, the writer advises choosing wines with vibrant acidity. This is to balance the strong acidic components of vinegar without overpowering the wine. Suitable wine choices for such dishes include sparkling wine, Muscadet, and dry Riesling. The key is to manage acidity levels to ensure the wine remains refreshing and not flat.\n\n3. **Interactive Food and Wine Pairing Tool:**\n   - Recognizing that there are numerous queries regarding pairing wine with vegetables and other challenging food items, the author mentions having developed an interactive tool on their website. This tool helps users pair wines with a variety of dishes including meat, pasta, seafood, vegetarian choices, pizza, eggs, cheese, and even desserts like JELL-O and fudge. The tool is regularly updated to cater to a wide range of pairings.\n\nThe document also encourages readers to seek personalized advice via email for any specific dish or wine pairing questions that are not covered by the online tool."

    "contenu": "### SAUCES THICKENED WITH DROPLETS OF OIL OR WATER: EMULSIONS\n\nThe sauces we've examined so far are liquids thickened with a fine dispersion of solid materials: protein molecules, starch granules, and molecules, particles of plant tissue, and cell-wall molecules. A very different thickening method is to fill the water-based liquid with droplets of oil, which are much more massive and slow-moving than individual molecules of water, impede their motion, and so create a thick and creamy consistency in the mixture as a whole. Such a dispersion of one liquid in another is called an **emulsion**. The word comes from the Latin for “to milk out,” and referred originally to the milky fluids that can be pressed from nuts and other plant tissues. Milk, cream, and egg yolks are natural emulsions, while sauce emulsions include mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, beurre blanc, and oil-and-vinegar salad dressings. Modern chefs have applied the basic idea to the thickening of all kinds of liquids, and often actually describe the result on the menu as an **emulsion**, a word that lingers on the tongue longer than **sauce** does.\n\nEmulsified sauces offer a special challenge to the cook: unlike sauces thickened with solids, emulsions are basically unstable. Whisk oil and a little vinegar together in a bowl, and the vinegar forms droplets in the oil: but they soon sink and coalesce, and in a few minutes the two liquids have separated again. Cooks not only have to form the emulsion, they also have to prevent the emulsion from being undone by the basic incompatibility of the two liquids.\n\n#### The Nature of Emulsions\n\nAn emulsion can only be made from two liquids that don’t dissolve in each other, and therefore retain their distinct identities\n\n#### The Relative Proportions of Fat and Water in Common Food Emulsions\n\n| Food                   | Parts Fat to 100 Parts Water |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Fat-in-Water Emulsions**  |                               |\n| Whole milk             | 5                             |\n| Half-and-half          | 15                            |\n| Light cream            | 25                            |\n| Heavy cream            | 70                            |\n| Heavy cream reduced by a third | 160                |\n| Egg yolk               | 65                            |\n| Mayonnaise             | 400                           |\n| **Water-in-Fat Emulsions**   |                               |\n| Butter                 | 550                           |\n| Vinaigrette            | 300                           |"

Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Salting in Preservation:**\n   - **Purpose:** Salting plays a crucial role in both dried and undried meat and fish preservation.\n   - **Process:** Works by osmosis, drawing water out of the flesh which inhibits microbial growth.\n   - **Benefits:** Reduces water activity in the flesh, making it less hospitable to microorganisms and enzymes. Salinity levels determine what types of organisms can survive.\n   - **Specific Inhibition:** A 10% salt concentration can prevent the growth of C. botulinum in typical ambient temperatures and neutral pH levels.\n   - **Combination Effects:** Lower salt concentrations can inhibit harmful bacteria when combined with acidification, cool temperatures, and minimal drying.\n\n2. **Curing Related to Salting:**\n   - **Definitions and Process:** While curing is related to salting, it refers to broader post-harvest treatment including the use of salt, spices, and sometimes sugar.\n   - **Examples:** Covers a range of products, from tobacco and firewood to bacon and olives. Specifically, bacon and certain pickled vegetables are typical examples where curing is utilized.\n   - **Detailed Example:** Discusses the Scandinavian technique of preparing gravlax by coating salmon with salt, sugar, dill, and other spices, and allowing it to cure in the refrigerator.\n   - **Effects of Curing:** Limits water content, reduces microbial and enzymatic degradation, and creates chemical reactions that alter the food's texture and structure.\n\n3. **Specific Use of Cure:**\n   - **Special Case:** Sometimes 'cure' specifically refers to the use of mineral salts such as nitrite and nitrate, which have unique preservative effects beyond basic salting and drying.\n\nThis document provides a detailed look into how salting and curing preserve food, especially detailing the processes, effects, and some specific methods used in different regions or with different foods."

The region is known for its gravelly soil derived from Ice Age glaciers, which contributes to the profound taste and exquisite texture of the wines produced there. A notable feature of this region is the presence of tiny white quartz pebbles in the soil, which are found in its premier vineyards.\n\nThe document highlights Château Haut-Brion as the only estate outside the Médoc to be classified as a First Growth in the 1855 Classification. Graves is unique in Bordeaux for producing both red and white wines in most of its châteaux. The vineyards in this region are among the most ancient in Bordeaux and gained international recognition early on, dating back to the 12th to 16th centuries.\n\nChâteau Haut-Brion, referred to as “Ho Bryan” historically, gained acclaim from figures such as Thomas Jefferson, who admired the wine's quality and ordered it for the U.S. The top wines of Graves, including Haut-Brion, were first classified in 1953, with a subsequent revision in 1959.\n\nThe document also mentions the Pessac-Léognan appellation within Graves, which consists of a group of ten communes. This area is known for both its red and white wines.\n\nLastly, the text addresses a common misconception about Graves, noting that it produces more red wine than white, contrary to the expectations of many who associate the area predominantly with dry white wines."

The black-hoofed Ibéricos, thought to be related to a particular type of wild boar that once roamed the Iberian Peninsula, have a somewhat more complex, sweet, nutty, and profound flavor than the Landrace, thanks to their diet of wild roots, bulbs, corn, wheat, and especially acorns, on which the animals gorge themselves. The most prized Ibéricos come from the village of Jabugo, in the province of Huelva, just north of Sherry country. Many European connoisseurs consider **jamón de Jabugo** the world’s ultimate cured ham, surpassing even the finest prosciutto.

Here's a structured summary of the document:\n\n### Japanese Koji and Moto: One Mold, Separate Yeast\n- **Koji**: Utilizes Japanese *koji*, made from polished, unground rice and the culture of *Aspergillus oryzae* alone. This process excludes other molds and focuses on pure culture preparation.\n- **Moto**: Traditional process involves souring cooked rice with yeast and a bacteria mixture (*Lactobacillus sake, Leuconostoc mesenteroides,* and others), taking over a month to mature. However, modern methods accelerate this through direct introduction of acids or concentrated yeast to the main fermentation, creating lighter, simpler sakes.\n\n### Chinese Practice: Ordinary Rice and High Temperatures\n- Involves soaking the mold preparation in water and adding ordinary cooked rice periodically during fermentation at around 85°F/30°C. The process concludes with cooling, pressing, filtering, coloring with caramel, and pasteurizing at 190°-200°F/85°-90°C for 5-10 minutes.\n\n### Japanese Practice: Polished Rice and Low Temperatures\n- Utilizes rice that has been milled to remove roughly 10% of the grain for ordinary rice and at least 30% (up to 50% for high-grade sake) for premium sake, focusing on the starchier parts of the rice. Fermentation occurs at significantly lower temperatures than the Chinese method.\n\n### Brewing Rice Alcohols: Simultaneous, Stepwise Fermentation\n- Both Chinese and Japanese methods involve simultaneous fermentation of alcohol-producing yeasts and starch-digesting molds with cooked rice. New portions of rice are gradually introduced into the fermentation instead of all at once. The document emphasizes the shared yet distinctively different approaches between the two cultures in their rice alcohol brewing processes."

It covers topics under processes like \"Presses\", \"Acid\", \"Fermentations\", and aspects of fermentation involving yeast and temperature for maintaining the quality of wines.\n\n### Presses\nThe document details two types of wine presses:\n1. **Vertical basket presses.**\n2. **Three pneumatic presses.** - These involve a bladder inside the press that can be filled with compressed air to press the grapes against rigid internal structures.\n\n### Acid\nIn wine making, acid levels can be adjusted by:\n- **Acidification:** Adding tartaric acid in powdered form to raise acid levels. This is common in regions with warm climate.\n- **Deacidification:** More common in cooler climates, where natural acid levels might not be high enough during ripening. Excess acid may be reduced by adding an alkali.\n\n### Fermentations\nThe section discusses alcoholic fermentation, which converts sugar into alcohol and CO₂. It mentions:\n- **Alcoholic fermentation** occurs optimally below 35°C to prevent issues like sugar exhaustion that could inhibit fermentation. Stopping this pre-emptively or post excessive fermentation involves methods like heating, adding sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and sweet winemaking techniques.\n\n### Yeast and Temperature Management\n- **Yeast selection** can significantly affect the wine, with options between ambient yeast strains from the environment or selecting specific, consistent commercial yeasts.\n- **Temperature management** plays a crucial role, balancing the need to keep yeast active without overheating, allowing for controlled flavors and aromas within the wine.\n\nThese specifics delineate crucial aspects of winemaking that directly affect the style and quality of the end product."

    "contenu": "### GATTINARA, GHEMME, NEBBIOLO D’ALBA, AND SPANNA\n\nA slew of wines besides Barolo and Barbaresco are made from nebbiolo, including Gattinara, Ghemme, nebbiolo d’Alba, and spanna. Nebbiolo d’Alba is slightly different from the others in that, like Barolo and Barbaresco, it is produced in the famous Langhe foothills near the town of Alba. But the grapes that go into nebbiolo d’Alba come from outlying areas and don’t quite have the finesse and power that nebbiolo intended for Barolo and Barbaresco possesses. Still, nebbiolo d’Alba is a good, lower-priced “starter” wine before one jumps into the deep end of the pool with Barolo and Barbaresco, and because it’s less powerful, it doesn’t require the same aging that its more famous sisters do.\n\nGattinara and Ghemme are produced far north of Alba, in colder Alpine foothills with glacial soil and terrain. Although Gattinara in particular can occasionally seem like a mini Barolo, with fairly powerful flavors, both Gattinara and Ghemme are generally leaner than Barolo or Barbaresco, with simpler flavors and tannin that is sometimes aggressive. The Italians would never drink these wines without food (they’d taste too harsh), and indeed the wines can taste entirely transformed if drunk with a juicy roast or creamy risotto. Gattinara and Ghemme are frequently made with a small percentage of bonarda or vespolina, two minor blending grapes that help tone down and soften the northern-grown nebbiolo. The best known of these wines in the United States is the Gattinara made by Travaglini, shipped in an almost square-shaped black bottle.\n\n### DOLCETTO—EAT, DRINK, DO A LITTLE BUSINESS\n\nDolcetto, a model of versatility, has been used by the Piedmontese in a number of creative (and commercial) ways. The wine is a traditional accompaniment to dishes such as tajarin (thin, gold-colored pasta made with up to forty egg yolks) with butter and sage. But the grapes themselves—unlike most wine grapes—can also be delicious eaten raw as table grapes. They are even cooked down and made into cognà, a jam served with local hard cheeses such as Murazzano, from sheep’s milk, and Castelmagno, mainly from cow’s milk. And why not do a little business while you are eating? Historically, the commercially savvy Piedmontese also used dolcetto grapes to barter with neighboring Ligurians for their famous green-tinged olive oil, salt, and anchovies."

AUSTRALIANS DRINK AN AVERAGE OF 8 GALLONS (30 LITERS) OF WINE PER PERSON PER YEAR.**\n\nIf it were superimposed over Europe, Australia—a huge land-mass of 3 million square miles (7.8 million square kilometers)—would stretch from London to the Black Sea. The wine industry within this large country is one of the most dynamic and cutting-edge in the world.\n\nThe past few decades have been a period of phenomenal growth for Australian wine. According to Wine Australia (formerly known as the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation), during the ten years from 1995 to 2005 alone, the number of wine companies more than doubled (to more than two thousand); the grape crush more than doubled to 2 million tons (1.8 million metric tons); and vineyard plantings tripled to 390,000 acres (157,800 hectares). Exports during this period quadrupled in value, and for two countries—the United Kingdom and the United States—Australian wine, especially good-value Australian wine, became a comfortable mainstay on the wine scene.\n\nHigh-tech could be the Australian wine industry’s middle name. Most wineries use state-of-the-art equipment and employ wine-makers trained in the most advanced techniques. Virtually every vineyard task, from pruning to harvesting, is automated. Yet, for all this industrial sophistication, most Australian wines are rather like the Australians themselves: charismatic and outgoing. This is certainly true of the country’s simple, inexpensive wines. But even Australia’s most prestigious and complex wines, like Penfolds Grange and Henschke’s Hill of Grace, have a hedonistic charm that makes them disarmingly approachable.\n\nFor a large part of the twentieth century, the majority of the wine made in Australia was either cheap and sweet or had a substantial level of alcohol. But, as was true in the United States, the industry here changed radically in the 1970s, as high-quality dry wines became the focus. By the mid-1980s, Australia had a well-developed modern industry made up of small, top-notch producers, as well as big brands focused on creamy chardonnays and soft shirazes."

    "contenu": "The document discusses different aspects of wine, focusing on the processes involved in making sparkling wines, other sparkling wines, sweet wines, and providing tips on enjoying sparkling wines. Here is a structured summary:\n\n### Making Champagne\n- **Aging**: The Champagne process starts by letting the wine age in contact with yeast sediment for a few months to several years, which enriches the wine with complex flavors.\n- **Disgorging**: After aging, the yeast sediment is removed, and the wine is topped off with additional wine mixed with sugar and brandy.\n- **Recorking**: Finally, the Champagne bottle is recorked.\n\n### Making Other Sparkling Wines\n- **Methods**: \n  - Some versions are made by minimizing sediment or eliminating the secondary fermentation.\n  - Cheaper versions are carbonated like soft drinks using pressurized carbon dioxide.\n\n### Sweet Wines\n- **Dry Fermentation**: Typically, table wines are fermented until they are dry, implying that all fermentable sugars have been converted.\n\n### Methods to Increase Residual Sugar in Sweet Wines\n- **Addition of Unfermented Grape Juice**: Sweet wines may be made by sweetening ordinary dry wine with unfermented grape juice.\n- **Drying Grapes**: Concentrate sugars by drying grapes on the vine or after picking (up to 35% or more of the grape weight in sugars).\n- **Freezing**: Grapes are left on the vine past the first frost and then picked when frozen to gently extract concentrated juice.\n- **Botrytis Cinerea Infection**: Allowing grapes to become infected with the mold \"noble rot,\" which concentrates their sugars and alters their flavor.\n\n### Enjoying Sparkling Wines\n- **Best Conditions for Enjoyment**: Sparkling wines should be served very cold in tall, narrow glasses to appreciate their sparkle. \n- **Factors Affecting Bubbly Qualities**: Carbon dioxide dissolves better at lower temperatures, enhancing bubble longevity. Bubble dissipation can be accelerated by factors like soap residue or oils from lips touching the glass.\n\nThis section from a larger text describes how sparkling and sweet wines are crafted and enjoyed, focusing on methods that enhance or maintain the carbonation and sugar content to achieve desired flavor profiles."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content from the provided document:\n\n---\n\n### PAIRING WITH FOOD\n\nEven more appealing than Grüner’s distinctive flavor profile is its versatility at the table. There’s little that Grüner doesn’t go with, and a whole assortment of foods with which it can pair where many other grapes can’t. Want a wine to go with asparagus? Artichokes? Strong-flavored fish and shellfish? This is it. For a wine to go with bitter greens like escarole or collard greens, look no further. But Grüner is not simply a wine for taming belligerent food: it can pair with many other dishes.\n\nJust about every Asian restaurant with some ambition in its wine list carries at least one GV. It’s as happy with the correctly chosen Chinese dishes as with Indian, Vietnamese, or Indonesian food. The core herb and spice profiles of these countries—from Thai basil to tamarind, cardamom to coriander—pair well with the inherently spicy and aromatic nature of the wine. So many sommeliers pair Vietnamese spring rolls with a young GV that it's becoming almost as established a match as French Chablis and oysters—and equally wonderful!\n\nGrüner is just as enjoyable with rich white meats, fowl, and charcuterie. If you’ve had a plate of schnitzel and potatoes served with a balanced Grüner, you’ll believe in the old saying about wines and foods growing up together. But GV can also be sublime with a sweet, spiced bundt blanc or similar white sausage (say, bratwurst) and is lovely with a simple chicken breast grilled with a North African seasoning based on caraway and cumin.\n\nFinally, Grüner is great with legumes, with which it shares personality traits. Lentil stew with pork and sausage, a southwestern chili made with white beans and green chile, and a bowl of lima beans and ham are all superb when matched with a balanced GV.\n\n### PAIRING POINTERS\n\nGrüner Veltliner goes well:\n- With aromatic and distinctive marinades or sauces. Off-dry Grüner plays especially well with sweet and sour (yes, here’s a good wine for sweet-and-sour pork!), sweet and salt, and sweet and spicy aromatics (chiles).\n- With most styles of Asian food. From Indian to Indonesian, this wine is almost always able to connect the dots. In addition to the pairing with Vietnamese spring rolls, try GV with noodle stir-fries, wok-charred vegetables, and even tofu.\n- With salads and vegetables. These dishes, often posing challenges in matching with wine, are easy for Grüner. This wine will stand up to asparagus (both green and white) as well as artichokes. Also, most composed green salads, Asian or European inspired, fare quite nicely.\n- With beans and lentils. Lentils of all colors (green, brown, pink, or red), are great with Grüner, so if you feel like drinking white wine with your sausage and lentils, you’re golden. The same is true for a loin of rabbit served with fava beans with bacon.\n\n---\n\nThis content organizes information into two sections discussing \"Pairing with Food\" and \"Pairing Pointers\" for Grüner Veltliner. Each section details various ways the wine can complement a range of dishes, encompassing everything from meats and seafood to vegetables and legumes."
