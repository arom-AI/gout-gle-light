There were historical concerns in the 1940s, and renewed concerns a decade ago about potential bans, particularly targeting imported raw-milk cheeses, as noted by a New York Times quote about rising fears of bans. This context reflects ongoing debates about the appropriateness of the aging standard and its implications.\n\n3. **American Raw Milk Cheese Presidium and Scale Issues in Regulation:**\n   - The American Raw Milk Cheese Presidium, a collaborative effort between Slow Food and the Raw Milk Cheesemakers’ Association, requires members to follow strict guidelines that are even stricter than FDA’s, including adherence to rigorous HACCP plans. While larger operations can manage these demands, smaller ones may find them overly burdensome or even unmanageable, raising concerns about the fairness and practicality of these regulations for smaller scale operations."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"GAUGING THE BODY WEIGHT\" discusses how the term \"body\" in the context of wine refers to the weight of the wine on your palate, categorizing it as light, medium, or full. The passage explains the analogy of the body of wine in relation to the weights of different types of milk: skim, whole, and half-and-half.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. **Understanding Wine Body**: The body of a wine does not reflect its quality or the intensity of its flavors, nor how long the finish will be. The example given is that of great sorbet, which has a light body but delivers quality and intense, sustained taste.\n\n2. **Source of Body**: The body of a wine primarily arises from its alcohol content. Wines with low alcohol content are considered light-bodied, whereas those with high alcohol content are full-bodied. Alcohol in wine is derived from sugar, which in turn comes from the grapes that absorb sunlight.\n\n3. **Implications of Wine Body**:\n   - A full-bodied wine implies a high alcohol level.\n   - High alcohol content means a significant amount of sugar was present during fermentation, suggesting that the grapes were very ripe.\n   - Very ripe grapes indicate that they were grown in a very warm climate, since ripe grapes require significant heat.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Origin**: The document suggests that a full-bodied wine likely comes from a warm region like Australia or California, as opposed to cooler regions such as Austria, Burgundy, or Germany.\n\nThis explanation helps readers infer the origin and characteristics of a wine based on its body, emphasizing an indirect link between the wine’s body, the fermentation process, and the climatic conditions of the vineyard."

Below is the structured content derived from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Champignon & Courge\n- **Description**: Champignon vénéneux et citrouille, une combinaison de conte de fées. La citrouille et le potiron ont beau être sucrés, ils ont un côté terreux qui les rend tout à fait compatibles avec les champignons des bois. Les chanterelles, dont la note légèrement fruitée de courge est facilement perceptible, forment avec la courge un partenariat idéal.\n- **Cuisine Example**: Le chef Phillip Howard, au restaurant The Square à Londres, sert de la purée de potiron, des chanterelles, du poireau et de la truffe noire avec des coquilles Saint-Jacques (il prépare également un plat de linguistines avec de la purée de potiron, des rondelles de trompette de la mort et encore plus de champignons des champs et des gnocchis au parmesan accompagnés d'une émulsion aux pommes de terre et aux truffes). Au Kitchen W8, l'autre restaurant plus modeste du coudre Howard, on propose une combinaison plus simple de courge musquée et de chanterelles dans un risotto au vin rouge, coiffé d'un œuf poché mollet.\n\n### Champignon & Fromage à pâte molle\n- **Alternative Name**: Fromage à pâte molle & Champignon.\n- **Dish Idea**: Parmesan qui apporte la tenueur en sel à un risotto, à des pâtes ou à des bruschette aux champignons. Le gruyère est aussi délicieux avec des champignons sur du pain grillé.\n- **Serving Suggestion**: Combine pecorino romano with finely chopped mushrooms in an omelette or with grilled cheese type dishes.\n\n### Champignon & Fromage bleu\n- **Key Detail**: Les moisissures dans les fromages bleus, avec le gorgonzola et des cèpes de Bordeaux, est un plat populaire dans la région du Trentin en Italie.\n- **Suggested Usage**: You can make a savory cabbage soup with aged cheeses, leeks, wild mushrooms from the regions of Trentino, even before serving.\n\n### Champignon & Fromage de chèvre\n- **Historical Context**: The Agaricus bisporus used to be considered common and was given to agricultural workers in the UK until the 1980s as a non-financial benefit.\n- **Culinary Perspective**: Now seen as a gourmet product, especially when paired with goat cheese, these mushrooms were codified in European cuisine as originating from Saumur.\n\n**Additional Details**: Each combination is explored through a blend of flavor, regional preferences, and innovative culinary techniques."

Such cocktails, created to express a unified idea, are what we call concept drinks.\n\nWhereas Mr. Potato Head, dressing up naked drinks, and splitting base spirits and modifiers are all ways to remodel existing cocktails, concept drinks are created from the ground up. As a result, they require a lot of patience and tinkering to get right. To best illustrate the process of developing a concept drink, we asked Brad Farran, our resident conceptual cocktail artist, to explain the process behind a few of his concept drinks:\n\n#### JULIUS ORANGE\n“I loved Orange Julius as a kid and wanted to re-create that flavor in a sophisticated cocktail. For a base spirit I started with dry curaçao, which has an orangey flavor, obviously, but also a strong vanilla note, as does an Orange Julius. Then I started playing around with rums as a modifier, particularly rums that could enhance that vanilla flavor. It’s fun to use a modifier as a base spirit and vice versa. After that it was a matter of adding other elements to balance it out: lemon juice for acidity, a little bit of cream for richness, and a teaspoon of Vanilla Syrup to really pump up that flavor. Originally I didn’t include orange bitters in the drink, but when I added them it made it taste a lot more like a cocktail and less like something you might buy at the mall.”\n\n#### CRANE KICK\n“I love the original Karate Kid movie and decided to create a drink based on Daniel’s signature move. I asked myself, What does the name imply? The answer: Japanese signature move. I asked myself, What does the name imply? The answer: Japanese signature move."

    "contenu": "# Ibérico Ham\n\nThe aldehydes in Ibérico ham provide a complex range of fruity, nutty, meaty and citrusy flavours, which are rounded out by caramelic and maple-scented furans.\n\nIt is said that salt, air, and time are all it takes to transform Iberian pigs into black label jamón Ibérico de bellota, but of course there is more to the art of curing than just that. Not to be confused with Serrano ham or even the widely available grain-fed jamón Ibérico de cebo, this premium Spanish dry-cured ham owes its unique flavour to the pigs’ special breed characteristics, their acorn-rich foraged diet and the centuries-old tradition of curing passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nIn the case of the black-label-grade hams, the prolonged fermentation and curing process can last from three to five or even six years. This allows plenty of time for the degradation of proteins and fats thanks to their natural diet of formation of new aroma molecules. Addicts to acciou, leading to the grass, herbs and bellota (acorns), which occur high in oleic acid, Iberian pigs possess a much higher concentration of antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids, yielding a luxuriously silky texture and a more intense flavour than you will find in Serrano hams or any lesser grade Iberian hams.\n\nDuring the autumn and winter seasons, known as the montanera, purebred Iberian pigs graze on acorns among the cork and oak trees of the dehesa, the protected grasslands of southwestern Spain and southern Portugal. The Iberian pigs enjoy this diet of acorns for two montanera cycles before slaughter to ensure only the highest quality of flavour. By winter’s end, the pedigree pigs will have doubled their weight, feasting on up to 10kg (22lb) of acorns per day.\n\nThe flavour of the black label jamón Ibérico de bellota is a pure expression of the pig’s ancestral Iberian lineage, diet and plenty of exercise roaming freely throughout the dehesa. Non-heritage breed pigs used for red label jamón Ibérico de cebo follow the same foraging and feeding schedule as the black label herds and are likewise cured for three years. Jamón Ibérico cebo de campo is distinguished by its green label; these pigs are fed a mixture of grains and acorns.\n\nSpanish families have traditionally butchered their own pigs, breaking down the choice cuts and reserving the remainder for chorizo, salchichón and morcilla sausages to last them throughout the year. The fatty legs are cured in sea salt for about a week, depending upon the weight, to draw out moisture, which causes the hams to lose nearly half of their water content over the spring and summer.\n\nThe hams are then rinsed and hung up to dry in climate-controlled cold rooms for a month or two to allow the flesh to absorb the salt as it cures. The legs are then transferred to a drying space and sweated using natural ventilation for between six months and a year. Bellota hams are much fattier than Serrano hams, marked by thick white stripes of fat coursing through their muscles; longer curing and drying times are required to allow the fat to be fully absorbed into the muscle fibres. As the meat dries, the degradation of proteins and fats occurs, giving way to the formation of new aroma molecules that are responsible for the complex flavour profile of this prized ham. Hams are aged for a minimum of three years in naturally ventilated cellars, where the temperate Mediterranean breezes and unique microbial flora impart their distinctive flavour. To determine readiness, a trained specialist inserts a bone into each ham to check for colour and aroma.\n\nIbérico ham is at its best served at room temperature (about 21–23°C or 70–73°F) so the fat is soft and juicy. Traditionally, it is cut thin and silent by hand. Some people prefer it without any accompaniments, in order to savour the aroma of nuttiness, grassy herbs, and the highlights from the flowering heather. However, the hams complement a number of other foods. These include peanuts, endive and figs, though very acidic fruit flavours should be avoided to prevent masking its unique taste. Dry sparkling white wines, for example Cava or Champagne, pair well, as do sherry and sake.\n\n### Notes:\n- **Ibérico ham** refers to the cured hind leg of the pig. It is also possible to buy the foreleg cured in the same way. It is smaller and sold as Ibérico shoulder (paleta Ibérica). The same labelling system applies, with black label indicating the highest quality. There is some difference in flavour between the ham and the shoulder, in part because of the higher proportion of fat in the shoulder, but also because its maturation period tends to be shorter.\n\n- To make **pan con tomate**, rub a clove of garlic over a slice of toasted baguette. Top with freshly grated tomato pulp and a few thin slices of jamón Ibérico, then drizzle over extra-virgin olive oil to finish."

In most cases, however, it’s more useful to think of them as indicators of style. Among wines released during a given year, those with the most recent vintage dates are most likely to emphasize youthful fruitiness. The youngest whites will be unoaked and full of snappy acidity, whereas the youngest reds should display a fresh and sappy charm. Older vintages will range more widely but should offer greater depth and complexity, often thanks to barrel aging at the winery.\n\n---\n\n**Wine Shopping**  \\[Page 89\\]"

    "contenu": "**Title:** Southern France\n\n**Subtitle:** The vineyards of southern France lie along the Mediterranean coast from Italy in the east to the Spanish border in the west. They are split into three broad areas: Languedoc and Roussillon to the west of the Rhône, and Provence to the east. The prevalence of the local IGP, Pays d’Oc, for the wines of Languedoc and Roussillon, alongside a number of more traditional appellations means that a great diversity of wine styles can be found in this part of France.\n\n### CLIMATE AND GRAPE GROWING\nThis region has a warm Mediterranean climate with summer temperatures often in excess of 30°C, mild winters and low rainfall levels especially during the growing season. Consequently, in most years this area can offer ideal conditions for growing grapes. However, the region is by no means uniform. Vineyards planted inland in the foothills of the mountains that surround this region are noticeably cooler than those on the coastal plain and often have less fertile, well-drained soils that are better suited to quality viticulture. Strong winds can also have a significant impact on the climate. Cool dry winds blow from the north, moisting the eastern and western ends of the region. The collar blows down the Rhône valley and the Tramontane blows through the gap between the Massif Central and the Pyrenees. The warm dry climate means that the biggest grape growing challenge is drought, whereas fungal diseases are less of a problem here than anywhere else in France. However, the region can occasionally experience summer floods.\n\n### GRAPE VARIETIES AND WINEMAKING\nBlack varieties account for the majority of the plantings in the region. The last 20 years has seen dramatic changes to the composition of the vineyards and today both black and white wines reflect a mix of local and international varieties.\n\n#### Black Varieties\nThe most important local varieties include **Grenache** and **Syrah**. Grenache is well suited to the warm, dry summer climate, whereas Syrah tends to perform better in the cooler sites. **Carignan** is also widely grown. This grape is naturally high in tannin, acidity and colour but can lack fruit finesse, although old vine Carignan on poor soil or on produce quality winds. Its popularity in the past was due to its ability to produce enormous yields, however, plantings have been reduced significantly, a trend that is likely to continue. Nevertheless, it is still so widely planted it is permitted by all AC regulations. There are smaller plantings of **Cinsault**, which is used in rosé production or to add red fruit flavours to red blends. **Mourvedre** can ripen successfully only in the warmest spots.\n\n#### Caption for Image:\nPloughing during the growing season to keep weeds under control."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the impact of fermented foods on various aspects of health, specifically focusing on digestive ailments and yeast overgrowth.\n\n### Fermented Foods and Digestive Health\nThe document suggests that fermented foods containing live lactic acid bacteria might improve digestion and alleviate a range of digestive conditions including constipation, diarrhea, and acid reflux. It hints at the potential of these foods to address both acute and chronic digestive issues without significant safety risks or high costs. The text advises introducing these foods slowly and in small doses since individual responses can vary.\n\n### pH and Fermented Foods\nThe document discusses the pH levels of fermented foods and their effects on the body’s alkaline-acid balance. While most ferments are acidic, certain foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and other acidic live-culture ferments are considered to have an alkalizing impact on the body. This is explained by their ability to make minerals more accessible, thus contributing to an overall alkalizing effect despite their acidic nature.\n\n### Candida Overgrowth and Diet Modification\n**Candida albicans**, a fungus and normal part of the human microbiota, can grow excessively due to a carbohydrate-rich diet. The document highlights dietary modifications necessary to control this growth, which include reducing intake of carbohydrate-rich foods such as sugar, grains, fruits, and potatoes, as well as the ferments made from them like bread and alcoholic beverages. However, some fermented products with live cultures, particularly those based on vegetables, milk, or beans, contain lactic acid bacteria that may help reduce the overgrowth of *Candida albicans*.\n\nThe document provides substantial information on how dietary choices can impact digestive health and microbiota balance through the consumption of various types of fermented foods."
