    "contenu": "### Retsina\n\nFew visitors to Greece escape without either falling in love with or learning to abhor retsina, the pungent, pine-resin-flavored wine, the drinking of which is virtually a baptismal right in Greek tavernas. Today, retsina (which has protected appellation status in Greece) accounts for an impressive 15 percent of Greece's total production of table wine. Retsinaed wines have a long history in Greece; traces of pine resin have been found in Greek wine amphorae dating back to the thirteenth century B.C. Modern retsina can be made anywhere in the country, although most of it is made in Attica, the region that surrounds Athens. While many different white grape varieties can be used, and are, the most common variety is savatiano, a relatively neutral white grape. Small amounts of resin from the Aleppo pine are added to savatiano grape juice as it ferments, imparting retsina's inimitable piney flavor and unmistakable turpentine-like aroma. Among non-Greeks, retsina is often the subject of good-natured jokes. But a number of Greeks take the unique wine quite seriously, suggesting that it is the perfect accompaniment to many Greek meze (small dishes of appetizers served like Spanish tapas).\n\n### Wines of the Peloponnese and Ionian Islands\nThe southernmost region of the Greek mainland is the peninsula known as the Peloponnese, which in fact is so completely surrounded by water that, save for the 4-mile-wide (6.4-kilometer) and 20-mile-long (32-kilometer) Isthmus of Corinth, it would be a large island. The vineyards of the Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands that surround it are concentrated in the more mountainous areas, either on rugged plateaus or in valleys wedged in between the mountain masses. The three most important wine regions here are Nemea, Mantinia, and Patras. The wines of Nemea, thought to have been the palace wines of Agamemnon, are made from the highly regarded agiorgitiko, a red grape. Nemea, firm and structured, can have a fascinating, spicy, and peppery flavor. The wine from Mantinia is usually a fantastic, dry, spicy, aromatic white, made from the pink-skinned grape moschofilero. And Patras is home to three different wines. In its most straightforward version, Patras is just a simple, dry white wine made from the roditis grape. More unusual and interesting is muscat of Patras, made from muscat blanc à petits grains, a viscous dessert wine that is sometimes fortified, sometimes not. Most idiosyncratic of all is mavrodaphne of Patras, made (in the best cases) 100 percent from mavrodaphne grapes (the word mavrodaphne means “black laurel”). Cheaper versions of mavrodaphne of Patras include black Corinth grapes, which are better known as the source of dried currants. Amber to mahogany colored, sweet, thick, fortified, complex, and slightly oxidized, mavrodaphne of Patras is aged for several years in barrels in a manner somewhat like tawny Port. Traditionally, Greeks drink mavrodaphne of Patras in the afternoon with a small plate of figs or oranges (although it is also stunning with chocolate). It is the wine most often used in Greek Orthodox churches during Holy Communion.\n\n### Hunting Down the Home of Easter Eggs\nDevouring a handful of milk chocolate Easter eggs or hunting around the backyard for plastic ones are two behaviors that are, well, all Greek to the Greeks. In Greece, where the practice of dyeing eggs for Easter originated, the custom continues to be a deeply felt religious ritual. The eggs (real ones, needless to say) are dyed on Holy Thursday (the Thursday preceding Easter Sunday) and are eaten after midnight mass on Holy Saturday as a way of breaking the Lenten fast. In Greece, Easter eggs are always dyed a deep red, symbolizing the blood of Christ, while they light represents life and regeneration. In some parts of northern Greece, the eggs are not just dyed, they are also hand painted with figures, often of birds—a symbol of Christ's resurrection from the dead.\n\nThe Aegean Islands are fascinating, small, enclavelike wine regions unto themselves."

Here’s the structured content:\n\n---\n\n### Old Italian Farms\nOld Italian farms typically engaged in “promiscuous agriculture.” Each farm would have vineyards, orchards, olive groves, vegetable gardens, and livestock—essentially covering everything a family would need to subsist on. Notably mentioned is an example of a farm in the Monferrato hills of Piedmont where barbera vineyards thrive.\n\n### The Quick Sip on Piedmont\n#### Notable Wines from Piedmont:\n- **Barolo and Barbaresco:** Described as Italy’s most majestic and powerful red wines, these come from Piedmont like other great red Bordeaux. They are typically aged for a decade or more before being drunk.\n- **Variety Base:** These wines are made from the Nebbiolo grape, known for its forceful tannin.\n- **Asti:** This wine comes across as a playful, delicious, semi-sweet sparkler, contrasting with the serious nature of Barolo and Barbaresco.\n\n### Characteristics and Cultural Context\nBarolo and Barbaresco are expensive, highly structured wines suitable for aging, sometimes even for decades. Traditionally, Piedmontese winemakers advised against drinking these wines for at least fifteen years—and often up to twenty-five years—to achieve desired softness at a younger age.\n\nThese wines are typically not ideal for casual drinking or pairing with light meals like salads. They shine in a cultural context where they can complement hearty meals such as roasted meats or pastas with rich sauces, often featuring truffles or bold flavors.\n\n### Other Notable Red Wines from Piedmont:\n- **Barbera and Dolcetto:** While Barolo and Barbaresco dominate the prestige hierarchy, Barbera and Dolcetto are two other red wines from the region. Barbera is vibrant, sometimes rustic, with vibrant, fresh fruit flavors and is the most widely planted variety in Piedmont. Dolcetto, on the other hand, is described as a juicy, quaffing wine often brought in from outside regions but is still popular locally.\n\nThis analysis summarizes the insights provided by the document into the traditional winemaking and wine culture of Piedmont, with specific attention to its iconic wines and general agricultural practices."

But if you encounter this food for the first time as an adult it will probably look and smell to you like rotten fish. You may or may not be able to overcome your aversion, and in fact your body may or may not be able to tolerate the decomposed fish and the microbial community that is part of it. Like the stinky cheese, the fermented fish requires an acquired taste, and perhaps an acquired microbial ecology. One culture’s greatest culinary achievement is sometimes another’s nightmare. And usually, both involve fermentation.\n\nAs early humans expanded their range, they adapted to different climates, different foods, and different microorganisms, yielding wildly differing cultural particulars. Everywhere, the phenomenon of fermentation has been an important part of the story. It enables people to use and preserve food safely, effectively, and efficiently, as well as digest it better, get more nutrition out of it, enjoy it more, and stay healthy. For our continued well-being—as individuals, communities, and as a species—and our continued ability to adapt to change, we must revive and perpetuate the essential cultural practice of fermentation.\n\n---\n\n**Visual Element:**\n- A simple black and white sketch of a bowl of olives at the top of the page.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe document reflects on the essential role of fermentation in human dietary practices, particularly focusing on how fermentation is perceived in various cultures. It speaks to both the necessity and acquired taste of fermented foods, linking them to broader themes of human adaptability and cultural diversity. The accompanying sketch of olives, while not explicitly mentioned in the text, subtly complements the theme of familiar fermented foods, as olives themselves are often fermented."

In the author's previous work, \"Wild Fermentation\", different fermented beverages from various cultures are explored:\n- Sweet potato fly: A lightly fermented beverage from Guyana made with sweet potatoes, mentioned in the dairy chapter due to whey being the starter.\n- Russian kvass: Discussed in the grain chapter.\n- Ginger beer: Mentioned in the wine chapter.\n- Shrub: Included in the vinegar chapter.\n- Kombucha: Initially placed in the grain chapter despite being made with tea and sugar but no grains.\n\nThe text explains that these beverages, among others, reflect longstanding traditions and also new variations being developed. They are characterized as tasty, somewhat acidic, sometimes lightly alcoholic, rich in live lactic acid bacteria, and are generally regarded as healthful and tonic. The term \"tonic\", as per the author's old Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, implies qualities of being invigorating, refreshing, and bracing. The author notes that these soft drinks exhibit these qualities. Furthermore, it is mentioned that most, but not all, of these beverages require starter cultures of microorganisms."

    "contenu": "# THE NINE ATTRIBUTES OF GREATNESS\n\nNo one needs a wine book to tell them what they **like** to drink. Subjectivity in wine is pretty easy. But a wine is not great merely because we like it. Liking a wine is simply liking a wine—it tells you something about what you take pleasure in.\n\nI would argue that to really know wine—and to consider its potential greatness—requires that we move beyond what we know we like. It requires that we attempt a larger understanding of the aesthetics behind wines that have garnered respect, wines that have consistently been singled out for their merit, wines that have, again and again over time, been cherished for their integrity and beauty. I’ll call this our best attempt at wine objectivity. And by attempting to objectively understand wine, we begin to inch toward the underlying principles that make great wine great.\n\nLike literature, then, wine encourages two assessments: one subjective, the other, objective. You may not like reading Shakespeare, but agree nonetheless that Shakespeare was a great writer. You may have loved that carafe of wine in the Parisian café... and yet know that it was not, in the end, a great wine.\n\nWhat does it take to have as objective an opinion as possible about a wine? Discernment, an open mind, and usually some experience in repeatedly tasting the wine so you have a feel for how it classically presents itself. Experience with the wine is, I think, especially critical. My own best example of this is Sherry. The first time I tasted Sherry I envisioned writing an article called “Death by Sherry.” I could not imagine why anyone would drink the stuff.\n\nToday, I consider Sherry one of the greatest wines in the world, and it has become one of my favorites. By tasting it over and over again with \"the willing suspension of disbelief\" (to borrow a literary concept), I came to a closer understanding of it. One day while tasting it, the light switched flipped. In that moment, I “got” Sherry. Many, many wines require this sort of pursuit. (As do foods. Who can say they had a good idea of how to evaluate sushi the first time they tasted it?)\n\nSo, open-minded tasting experience is key. Assembling all that experience is also the fun part. After years of doing that, here are the nine attributes that I believe matter most in determining whether a wine is great: distinctiveness, balance, precision, complexity, beyond fruitness, length, choreography, connectedness, and the ability to evoke an emotional response.\n\n## DISTINCTIVENESS\n\nIn the simplest sense, consider: If you buy a Granny Smith apple, you want it to taste like one. If it tastes simply generic—like any old apple—you’d probably be disappointed. In fact, the more Granny Smithish the Granny Smith apple is, the more it can be appreciated and savored for what it is. Great wines are great because they are distinctive; not because they exhibit sameness. This is true first of all for wines based on single grape varieties. Each variety of grape presents itself in an individual way (see Getting to Know the Grapes, page 53). Wines that fully and precisely express those individual grapes are said to be distinctive."

Here’s the structured content overview and cheese plate recommendations:\n\n### Tempranillo isn’t good:\n\n1. **When choosing the wrong style**:\n   - Tempranillo is versatile but choosing a mismatched style (e.g., a big wine from Toro for a simple dish) will not complement the meal well.\n   - For unsure choices, it’s suggested to pick a medium style.\n\n2. **With very bitter foods**:\n   - Foods like endive, unpeeled eggplant, and escarole can bring out a bitter streak in Tempranillo wines. To mitigate, match these with complementary ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n3. **With strongly flavored fish and shellfish**: \n   - The wine struggles with these, especially if the seafood is also heavily seasoned or prepared in a simple, minimally altered manner. A rosado, or lighter style, is recommended.\n\n4. **With salads and sharp dishes**:\n   - Sharp or acidic salads, as well as dishes with intense vinaigrettes or dairy dressings, are advised against with Tempranillo. The wine does not pair well with blue cheeses either, and a mild or less salty cheese is recommended instead.\n\n### The Cheese Plate\n\nHere is a structured breakdown of recommended cheese and wine pairings from the document:\n\n| **Type**      | **Cheese**                      | **Wine Pairing**  |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Fresh**     | Burrata, chèvre (many countries)| Rosé              |\n| **Semi-Soft** | Saint-Nectaire (France), tetilla (Spain)| Red, Rosé |\n| **Soft-Ripened** | Pierre Robert (France), robiola (Italy) | Red, Rosé |\n| **Semi-Hard**  | Manchego (Spain), São Jorge (Portugal) | Red |\n| **Hard**       | Dry or aged Jack (U.S.A.), aged Mahón (Spain) | Red |\n| **Blue**       | Cambozola (Germany), Castello (U.K.), Montbriac (France) | Rosé |\n\nThese pairings are designed to help in selecting the right type of cheese to complement various wines, particularly focusing on those that align well with rosé, red, or both."

    "contenu": "### CHIPS, BEANS, AND BLOCKS—OAK WITHOUT BARRELS\n\nConsider the cost of a tree grown for two centuries, and the price of barrels made, largely by hand, from that pristine wood. Not surprisingly, barrels are time consuming to make and breathtakingly expensive. After salaries, they’re often the second biggest yearly expense for a winery. (In 2011, one of the largest American wine companies spent a reported $22 million on barrels alone.) Yet, today, barrels are used virtually exclusively for fairly expensive wines. For their part, modestly priced wines rarely, if ever, rest inside barrels. Enter the brave new world of chips, powders, beans, blocks, and interstates. Made from oak wood that’s unsuitable for barrels, these barrel alternatives, as they are known, are a fraction of the cost of barrels (and, of course, the time and labor involved in making them is less). How are they used? Oak chips, beans, and blocks are added directly to the fermenting tank—either loose or enclosed in a giant mesh teabag. Staves can be inserted into frames that can be dropped into older barrels or suspended in stainless steel tanks. Finally, most barrel alternatives come toasted in a variety of ways and flavors worthy of a Starbucks menu. Spicy staves, anyone? How about premium dark-roast chips with extra vanilla and caramel?\n\nNo matter their range of flavors, barrel alternatives never achieve the subtle, complex effects of barrels. And while such alternatives are an asset in the making of inexpensive wines, as of this writing, I know of no great wine in the world that is made using them.\n\nI do want to quickly add that not every wine benefits from time in a barrel. For some wines—whites in particular—the weighty, sweet vanilla and toasted oak flavors of new wood can be like a glob of sauce masking the purity of the fruit itself. Moreover, some wines with oaky flavors haven’t actually spent time in barrels. It’s highly unlikely, for example, that an $18 chardonnay was fermented in a new French oak barrel that cost $1,300. The economics just don’t work. To get its oaky character, the chardonnay was probably made with a “barrel alternative.” For more about this, see Chips, Beans, and Blocks—Oak Without Barrels, above.\n\nAlthough open wooden buckets were used to hold and transport wine more than two thousand years before the Christian Era, closed oak barrels first came into use during the Roman Empire. Oak, extremely plentiful in the forests of Europe, had many desirable qualities: It was strong enough to withstand considerable wear and tear without busting apart, yet sufficiently malleable to be shaped into barrels that could be rolled and moved. Moreover, oak barrels were leakproof, despite the fact that nothing was (or is) used between the staves to seal them.\n\nLastly, oak usually had a desirable effect on the wine itself. Early winemakers discerned that wine grew softer, and in many cases tasted richer and more substantial, after oak aging. During the last third of the twentieth century, research on oak aging began to unravel the reason why.\n\nAt least as far as wine is concerned, oak wood is porous to a perfect degree. Both water and alcohol evaporate outward through the barrel’s staves and bunghole (the small access hole, closed with a stopper, or bung). A 60-gallon (230 liter) barrel of cabernet sauvignon, for example, may lose as much as 5 to 6 gallons (19 to 23 liters) of liquid per year—about thirty bottles of wine. At the same time, minute amounts of oxygen from outside are seeping through the grain and into the barrel, helping to weave together the elements of the wine and giving it a softer dimension. Oxygen also becomes a factor in the equation each time the winemaker removes the bung from the barrel and tops up the wine or partially clarifies it by racking it into another barrel."

It was annoying.\" Also applied to instances when our drinks show up on other bars’ menus without credit.\n\n- **SERVICE:** The bar station nearest the kitchen, where the bartender receives orders via printed ticket for customers seated at the tables (aka the floor).\n\n- **SHAKING ICE:** Large, 2-inch cubes of ice used to shake drinks, and a cause of many shoulder injuries at the bar. Also known as “block ice.”\n\n- **SIMPLE:** Short for \"simple syrup,\" a solution of equal parts sugar and water. Also abbreviated as SS.\n\n- **SPEC:** A cocktail recipe written or verbally described in cryptic shorthand. For example, \"Is your spec for a daiquiri two, one, three-quarter, or two, three-quarter, three-quarter?\"\n\n- **SPEED RACK:** The two rows of troughs that run the length of the bar and contain the vast majority of the ingredients (other than the cheaters), used to make the current menu of cocktails. Also known as “the rack.”\n\n- **SPLIT:** Using two or more different base spirits to anchor a cocktail. For example, \"I Mr. Potato Headed this old-fashioned by swapping out the bourbon and splitting the base between tequila and mezcal.\"\n\n- **THIN:** The opposite of fat.\n\n- **TIN ON TIN:** Our preferred shaker setup. For example, \"At my last job everyone used Boston shakers, but switching to tin on tin has saved my shoulder.\"\n\n- **WASH LINE:** The level to which a cocktail fills its serving glass. In most cases, an ideal wash line reaches the very top of a glass. A low wash line indicates an underdiluted drink. For example, \"The wash line on your daiquiri looks low. Did you shake it long enough?\"\n```\nThis provides a clear and concise representation of each term defined in the document, making it easy to understand various terms used in bartending."

These wands and devices mix air with a liquid along with substances such as proteins and surfactants to stabilize the foam.\n\n2. **Stabilizing Foams**:\n   - Explains that for a foam to be stable, the molecules must form a stable layer at the interface. This stability is usually achieved when substances such as lecithin and proteins are present. They stabilize oil droplets in emulsions by creating a water-soluble coat around water-insoluble proteins that results in sturdier bubble walls.\n   - The text also describes how solid enough foams form when sufficiently supplied with proteins or yolk phospholipids. However, the foam could still collapse if left standing because the bubbles within the foam have very different densities.\n\n3. **Heat-Stabilized Foams**:\n   - Details a specific type of foam known as Sabayons (or Zabaglione), which is a method derived from French and Italian cuisine that typically uses egg yolks, often with the addition of a liquid like broth or juice. \n   - Discussed the cooking process where proteins in egg yolks are heated and fold, stabilizing and thickening, and held in a stable foam when done gently and with sufficient exposure to beating and heat.\n\n4. **General Observations on Foam Stability**:\n   - Raises a note on the challenges of foam formation, particularly pointing out the physical instability due to the drainage and thinning of the foam, influenced by materials that interfere with the free movement of water molecules.\n\n5. **Terminology: Salt**:\n   - Briefly mentions the etymology of the word \"sauce\", which is derived from the Latin word for \"salt\".\n\nThis document appears to be an excerpt from a culinary science text or an educational resource, focusing on the chemistry and technique of foam formation and stabilization in cooking."

However, the text in the image is partly obscured and corrupted, which makes it challenging to provide a complete and accurate transcription. Below, I'll attempt to reconstruct and organize the information as much as possible from what is visible:\n\n---\n\n### BASIC WINE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThere are 5 characteristics that help define the profile of a wine: sweetness, acidity, tannin, alcohol, and body.\n\n#### Sweetness:\nSweetness in wine is derived from residual sugar (RS). Residual sugar is the leftover sweetness when not all the grape must is fermented into alcohol.\n\n#### Description of Sweetness Levels:\nSweetness is described as a taste which varies with the levels of sugar left after fermentation. We describe sweetness as a taste combined with lower acidity that enhances the perception of sweetness even compared to a wine with high sugar levels but with high acidity.\n\n### Sweetness Levels in Wine:\n(Note: Due to text cut-offs and corruption, some interpretations here might be off.)\n\n- **Dry:** \n  - **Caloric content:** 0-6 cal., 7-10 cal.\n  - **Sugar content:** 0-12 g/L RS, 12-17 g/L RS \n\n- **Medium Dry / Demi-Sec:**\n  - **Caloric content:** 10-20 cal.\n  - **Sugar content:** Unspecified.\n\n- **Sweet:**\n  - **Caloric content:** 20-30 cal. \n  - **Sugar content:** Unspecified.\n\nThis reconstruction only includes the parts that were coherent and at least somewhat readable from the corrupted document. The terms and ranges are used typically to describe the sweetness of the wine, though some specifics could not be accurately restored due to the condition of the text in the image."

We started out with the idea of something light, which brought us to the idea of using the juices of bulbly vegetables. As the ocean damp seeped into our bones, we began to crave more richness. So we kept reducing liquid as we cooked our way through this recipe, and the result was a meaty bulbly dish with layers of sweet warming richness and a delicious glaze. The directions look lengthy but this is a quick and simple rustic dish. It is also quite beautiful and dramatic to present at the table.\n\n**Serves:**\n4\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 3 pounds veal breast\n- Kosher salt\n- Freshly ground white pepper\n- ½ cup corn or other neutral oil\n- 2 large shallots, peeled\n- 1 medium onion, quartered\n- 1 leek, split and washed\n- 12 cloves garlic, unpeeled\n- 1/3 cup diced celery root\n- 2 bay leaves\n- 4 cloves\n- 1 tablespoon white peppercorns\n- ½ teaspoon whole cumin\n- ½ cabbage, cored and quartered\n- 2 cups dry white wine\n- 1 1/3 cups apple cider\n- 1/3 cup chive lengths (about 1 inch long)\n\n**Directions:**\nPreheat the oven to 250 degrees. Season the veal liberally with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the veal and cook, turning to brown on all sides. When the veal is nicely browned, transfer it to a plate. Add the shallots, onion, leek, garlic, celery root, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns, and cumin to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to brown.

Broil, using tongs to turn the peppers as needed, until blistered and charred on all sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a shallow bowl, cover, and let cool for about 10 minutes. The peppers will steam as they cool, which helps loosen the skin. Using your fingers, peel away the charred skin. Then, split each pepper open, remove and discard the stem and seeds, and dice the flesh. Set aside.\n   \n2. Cut or snap off the tough end from each asparagus spear. Using a vegetable peeler, thinly peel the skin from each spear to within about 2 inches of the tip. Cut the spears crosswise on the diagonal into 2-inch lengths.\n\n3. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the asparagus and cook, stirring, until tender and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the diced peppers and garlic and toss to heat through, about 1 minute. Add the stock, bring to a boil, and remove from the heat. Set aside.\n\n4. Bring a large pot filled with salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, stir well, and cook until not quite al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain the pasta.\n\n5. Toss the pasta with the asparagus, peppers, remaining butter, thyme, prosciutto, and cheese. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Serve.\n\n---"

Here is the structured content:\n\n---\n\n**Œuf & Vanille:**\nLa vanille fait (mystérieusement) disparaître la saveur de l'œuf qui peut être particulièrement gênante et malvenue dans les pâtisseries et les desserts. Ils sont associés, avec de la crème, du lait, du sucre et de la farine, pour former œufs à la neige, crème caramel, crème brûlée, soufflé à la vanille, crème glacée à la vanille, flan et crème anglaise."

    "contenu": "### SHOPPING FOR WINE\n\nA number of the wines I discuss in this book are not easy to find and may require some legwork to track down. I wouldn’t walk into a Safeway or Publix and expect to find an array of Grüner Veltliners or Mencías. But you may be surprised by what you can buy locally: Grenache, Chenin Blanc, and Petite Sirah, for instance, are reasonably widely distributed. My advice for acquiring the best wines is as follows:\n\n- **Unusual wines are easier to find in fine wine stores than in grocery or big-box stores.** Depending on where you live, you may be pleasantly surprised at the range of wines available to you in your local market. And of course high-end grocers like Whole Foods, Dean & Deluca, and even Trader Joe’s carry some of the more esoteric varieties. But for many of the less common varieties, and for guidance in choosing among them, you're better off shopping at a specialty store.\n- **If you don't see what you want on the shelf, ask.** Less popular wines may be tucked away somewhere or can be ordered for you if you're a regular customer.\n- **Online shopping rules!** One of the best ways to find anything you want these days is to shop on the Internet. The world of wine is no different. I highly recommend Wine Searcher (www.wine-searcher.com) as a great site for finding and comparing prices on wines. In addition, many premium retailers nationwide have online stores and often (in states where shipping wine to customers is legal) competitive pricing on these hard-to-find bottles.\n\n### RECOMMENDED IMPORTERS\n\nThe vast majority of the wines in this book are imported. Indeed, several of them are not produced in the United States. Selecting among unfamiliar foreign labels can be daunting. Selecting from producers whose names you may not even be able to pronounce is downright scary. It’s been claimed that there are some thirteen thousand different wines available at retail. So where to begin? Choosing reliable importers and import companies is a start. Although there's no structured table to transpose from this document, the information laid out can be useful for anyone trying to navigate the purchase and selection of less common wines."
