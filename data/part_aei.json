    "contenu": "### ASSESSING THE AROMA\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, only a handful of elements in wine were known. Today, more than thirteen hundred volatile (smellable) compounds have been identified in alcoholic beverages. In wine, the perception of these aromas is exceedingly complex. Wine aromas are more than the sum of their parts. It’s the interactions between them that count. Aromatically, wine is more like a symphony than a series of instruments being played at the same time.\n\nMoreover, as sensory scientists point out, the genes that encode for olfaction are the largest group of genes in the body. Of the one million genes in the human genome, thirty thousand are solely dedicated to encoding smells. That’s a staggering number. Every bit of evidence we have suggests that smelling a wine is critical to tasting it.\n\nWhat many wine drinkers may not realize is that there are two centers of olfaction. (Humans are thought to be the only creatures to possess two sensory locations for the perception of smell.) The first, obviously, is the nose. Smelling via the nose is what scientists refer to as orthonasal olfaction. But olfaction also happens at the back of the mouth—or, as it is technically called, retronasal olfaction. When wine is mixed with your saliva and warmed, volatile compounds in the wine are released and waft back through the retronasal passage at the back of your mouth and up to the cavity behind the bridge of your nose. There, they are registered by receptor nerve cells, five million of which flash information to the olfactory bulb of the brain. These cells, stimulated by everything you breathe in and out, are the most exposed nerves in the body.\n\n> “As soon as I attempt to distinguish the share of any one sense from that of the others, I inevitably sever the full participation of my sensing body from the sensuous terrain. Many indigenous peoples construe awareness, or “mind,” not as a power that resides inside their heads, but rather as a quality that they themselves are inside of along with the other animals and plants, the mountains, and the clouds.”\n>\n> — DAVID ABRAM, _The Spell of the Sensuous_\n\nAmazingly enough, the two centers of olfaction do not appear to do the same job. Some molecules may be smelled via the nose, while others may only be smelled retronasally, giving you an oblique sense that you just “tasted” something.\n\nWhat is especially remarkable is the intensity with which smell can be registered. Dr. Marian W. Baldy, PhD, writing in the _American Wine Society Journal_ (“How the Nose Knows”), says, “The sensitivity of our sense of smell for some molecules is astonishing. We can detect the off-odor of hydrogen sulfide in concentrations of three parts per billion—the equivalent of locating a particular family of three in China—and even smaller amounts—one to five parts per trillion—of the compound pyrazine which accounts for the bell pepper aroma in cabernet sauvignon. This is like sniffing out a one-cent error in your ten billion dollar checking account.”"

Here’s a structured analysis of the content:\n\n1. **Units of Measurement**: \n   - The document begins by explaining how carbonation levels are measured in grams of CO2 per liter of beverage (g/l). \n   - It also mentions an alternate measurement termed \"volumes of CO2\", where one volume of CO2 equals 2 g/l.\n\n2. **Carbonation in Different Beverages**:\n   - Typical carbonation levels in various beverages:\n     - Cola: about 7 g/l.\n     - Orange soda and root beer: around 5 g/l.\n     - Tonics and mixers (with alcohol): around 8-9 g/l. \n   - It notes that nonalcoholic drinks generally have about 9 g/l of carbonation, which can become painful if it exceeds this value, whereas alcoholic drinks follow a different pattern.\n\n3. **Carbonation and Alcohol**:\n   - CO2 is more soluble in alcohol than in water, meaning less CO2 escapes a boozy drink compared to non-alcoholic ones.\n   - Alcoholic beverages require more CO2 to achieve the same level of perceived carbonation as non-alcoholic drinks because the alcohol impacts CO2 solubility.\n   - For example, young champagne, with an alcohol volume of 12.5%, can have up to 11.5 to 12 g/l of CO2 dissolved.\n\n4. **General Guideline**:\n   - The document posits a general guideline that the more alcohol a drink contains, the more CO2 is needed when carbonating.\n\n5. **Method of Measuring Carbonation**:\n   - The author describes their personal method for carbonating drinks, which involves controlling the temperature and adjusting the pressure but mentions that in practice, they do not measure carbonation meticulously.\n   - A suggested method to measure carbonation more precisely involves weighing the drink before and after carbonation and then calculating the difference to find the amount of CO2 added, which should be converted to grams per liter for understanding.\n\nThe document emphasizes the unique relationship between alcohol content and carbonation, providing insights into the practical aspects of achieving desired carbonation levels in alcoholic beverages compared to their non-alcoholic counterparts."

Below is the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Recipe: **Soupe de quinoa**\n**Serves**: 4 people  \n**Preparation Time**: 20 minutes  \n**Cooking Time**: 30 minutes\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- Quinoa: 150 g (white, black, red or mixed)\n- Potatoes: 4 medium (about 500 g)\n- Onion: 1 large\n- Garlic: 2 cloves\n- Dried tomatoes: 2 (or 10 g of dried tomato flakes)\n- Leafy vegetables: a few handfuls (spinach, chard, etc.)\n- Vegetable oil: 2 tablespoons (peanut or sunflower)\n- Water: 600 ml (3 times the volume of quinoa, to be measured)\n- Fresh or dried herbs, such as parsley, coriander, or mint (optional)\n- Ground cayenne pepper (optional)\n- Fine salt, ground black pepper\n\n#### Directions:\n1. Rinse and drain the quinoa. Peel the potatoes, onion, and garlic. Finely chop the onion. Cut the potatoes into pieces and roughly chop the leafy vegetables.\n2. Heat the oil in a pot. Sauté the onion until translucent, and then add the minced garlic. Stir for about 1 minute.\n3. Add the potato pieces, dried tomatoes, and leafy vegetables to the pot. Cook for 2 minutes.\n4. Add the quinoa and hot water to the pot. Season with half a teaspoon of salt (adjust according to preference) and cook over low heat for about 25 minutes.\n5. Towards the end of cooking, you can optionally add some minced herbs and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, or ground cayenne pepper.\n\n#### Chef’s Tip:\n- **Adaptability**: The consistency and flavor of the soup can vary depending on the season and availability of ingredients. For a richer consistency, it's common to finish cooking with a little poached egg stirred into the soup.\n- **Cultural Insight**: In Peru and Bolivia, where this type of soup is popular, it is typically enriched with local herbs and spices. If traditional Peruvian or Bolivian herbs are not available, other aromatic alternatives like coriander or mint can be used, along with a touch of Andean yellow chili pepper or any preferred hot spice.\n\n#### Additional Information:\n- **Page References**: \n  - Quinoa cooking details can be found on page 75.\n  - Garlic preparation is detailed on page 29.\n\n#### Nutritional Tip:\n- This soup is a nutritious option due to its mix of high-protein quinoa, vitamin-rich leafy vegetables, and hydrating broth, offering a balanced meal especially suitable for colder weather or high-altitude environments."

While it might sound like a badge of honor to christen one’s hard-earned original creation, coming up with a drink’s name is usually the most frustrating part of the process. It's not as easy as, say, naming a baby or a car. You can’t call a new cocktail Austin and move on. Nay, cocktail names need to be unique. For better or worse, there is only one Manhattan, and there will always be only one Slippery Nipple.\n\nMost of our drinks are perfected long before they have a name, with the exception of a concept drink (explained). If bartenders fail to name their new creations or give them names inappropriate for public consumption before our next menu is finalized, the task falls to the head bartender, who often has to assign names to a queue of drinks, Ellis Island style, minutes before the menu is printed.\n\nA very informal audit of our database of more than four hundred original Death & Co cocktails reveals a few commonly used drink-naming strategies.\n\n### THE MOVIE NOD\nUsually a reference to either lowbrow comedy or art-house cinema—rarely anything in between.\n\n**Examples:** Crane Kick, Strange Brew, Sergio Leone, Blazing Saddles, Coffee and Cigarettes, Cider House Rules, Fair Lady, and Jack Sparrow Flip\n\n### THE NOSTALGIA TRIP\nChildhood favorites for grown-ups.\n\n**Examples:** Good Humor, Pink Elephant, Camp Council, Little Engine, Dick and Jane, Koko B. Ware, and Rock, Paper, Scissors\n\n### THE SCHOLARLY REFERENCE\nBartenders showing off how well read they are.\n\n**Examples:** Dick Brautigan, Night Watch, Sling of Aphrodite, Hadley’s Tears, Porfirian Punch, Myra Breckinridge, The Dangerous Summer, Botany of Desire\n\n### THE A SIDE\nA musical reference that most guests will recognize.\n\n**Examples:** Cinnamon Girl, The Great Pretender, Rebel Rebel, Heart-Shaped Box, Lust for Life Punch, Dolly Dagger\n\n### THE B SIDE\nAn obscure musical reference our guests would love to forget.\n\n**Examples:** Eagle-Eye Cherry, Dr. Feelgood, Sade’s Taboo, Hallyday, Nina’s Moan\n\n### THE GENIUS\nVarious cocktails in the same category; often used for variations on classic drinks.\n\n**Examples:** Cobra Verde, Corallilo, Vipera, Puerto Rican Racer (all variations on the Diamondback)\n\n### THE NAME DROP\nShout-outs to our heroes, friends, and—perhaps too often—ourselves.\n\n**Examples:** Gonzalez, Light and Day, Last Ward, Shattered Glasser, Ty Cobbler, the Bittenbender\n\n--- \n\nThis document outlines the creativity and thought process involved in naming drinks in a bar setting, with various examples provided under different categories of naming strategies."

    "contenu": "### WHEN DOES A WINE NEED TO BE DECANTED?\n\nDecanting a wine, a more complex procedure than aerating, means pouring the wine off any sediment in the bottom of the bottle. So, in order to truly decant a wine, there has to be sediment in the first place.\n\n**Sediment**—long, chain molecules of color and tannin that have precipitated out of solution—is generally present only in older red wines (10-plus years old) that were once deeply colored, such as cabernet sauvignon, Bordeaux, and vintage Port. If you carefully take an older cabernet out of its resting place and hold it up to a light, you’ll often see a sort of crusty material clinging to the inside of the bottle. That’s sediment. (It’s more difficult to see the sediment in an old vintage Port, since many Port bottles are traditionally made from dark, opaque glass.) Of course, you could drink an old wine that has thrown some sediment without decanting it; the sediment is not harmful, just slightly teeth-clinging.\n\n**Decanters** can be useful for very old wines (which have thrown a sediment) or very young wines (to help “open up” the wine’s aromas and flavors).\n\nDecanting a wine is not difficult. First, the wine bottle must be placed standing upright for a day or two to let all the suspended sediment gently settle to the bottom of the bottle. Without picking the bottle up or turning it around, remove the cork slowly. Now pick the bottle up and begin pouring the clear wine slowly into a decanter. It’s best not to shake the bottle too much or tilt it back and forth as you pour. (Note: You can do this with the help of a light source, like a candle or flashlight, behind the neck of the bottle, or not.) When less than 2 inches of wine is left, you should begin to see sediment coming into the neck of the bottle. That’s when to stop. The clear wine is now all in the decanter; the sediment remains in the bottle."

    "contenu": "The document provided is an excerpt discussing the use and fermentation of amaranth stalks, inspired by a conference presentation by someone named Dunlop. Here is a detailed structured analysis of the key points covered in the text:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Ingredient:**\n   - The text begins by referencing a type of amaranth stalk ferment from Shaoxing, which the author was inspired to try after learning about it from Dunlop's presentation at a conference.\n\n2. **Preparation and Fermentation Process:**\n   - Amaranth stalks are collected when they are more than a meter tall, discarding woody bases and leaves.\n   - Stalks are cut into small pieces, soaked in cold water until the water becomes frothy, then washed and dried.\n   - The prepared stalks are sealed into a clay jar known locally as a 'feng 坟' and left in a warm place to ferment. This process is sensitive to temperature; too low and the stalks remain hard, too high and they dissolve away.\n   - After initial fermentation, saltwater is added, and the fermentation continues for a few more days until the stalks are ready to be consumed.\n\n3. **Personal Experience and Comparison:**\n   - The author describes their own experience using a glass jar for fermentation and notes the difference in flavor from traditional sour pickles, emphasizing the unique taste and texture of the fermented amaranth stalks.\n\n4. **Utility and Versatility of the Brine:**\n   - The brine produced by fermenting amaranth stalks is highlighted as a versatile ingredient that can be used to ferment other items like pumpkin, vegetables, and tofu.\n\n5. **Cultural and Historical Insight:**\n   - Dunlop provides context on the significance of fermented vegetables in Shaoxing, mentioning the origin myths associated with fermented delicacies in the region, which often relate to stories of overcoming poverty, and the innovative uses of fermentation to transform less desirable produce parts into flavorful components.\n\n6. **Reference to Further Reading:**\n   - The document mentions a discussion on fermenting tofu, which is covered in greater detail in chapter 11 of the source, linking the fermentation practices discussed with broader culinary techniques.\n\nThis analysis encapsulates the ideas and processes described in the document, presenting a clear view of the traditional and innovative culinary practices involving amaranth stalks in Shaoxing as shared by Dunlop, and explored further by the author."

Innovative methods could even simulate aging processes inexpensively using oak chips or oxygen.\n\n**Wine Grapes:**\n- Grapes provide essential substances that determine the qualities of wine:\n  - **Sugars:** Feed yeasts during fermentation, leading to alcohol production. Harvested when glucose and fructose are 20-30% of the grape.\n  - **Acids:** Tartaric and some malic acid prevent undesirable microbial growth and contribute to wine's flavor.\n  - **Tannins and Phenolic Compounds:** Contribute to the astringent feel and body of wines.\n  - **Pigment Molecules:** Provide color and contribute to astringency. Red grapes contain anthocyanin pigments.\n  - **Aroma Compounds:** Provide the distinctive aromas, often not evident in the raw fruit but released during fermentation by fruit and yeast enzymes.\n\n**Grape Varieties and Clones:**\n- Grapevines have the ability to regenerate effectively and show vigorous growth and easy propagation by cuttings.\n- Grapes are adaptable, with varieties or \"clones\" that have specific adaptations to different environmental conditions.\n\n**Transformation Influence:**\n- Industrial wines are noted for their consistency and lack of faults, but they might not provide the distinctive taste found in wines produced from grapes of a particular region and year.\n- There is appreciation for traditionally produced wines which reflect the specific conditions of their origin, suggesting a uniqueness that industrial wines may not capture.\n\nThe document discusses the elements of wine production, focusing both on traditional practices meant to optimize quality and modern industrial approaches designed to cut costs and standardize output. It also delves into the components of wine grapes that significantly impact the final product in terms of taste, aroma, and appearance."
