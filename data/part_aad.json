Archaeological evidence and documents suggest Chinese alchemists distilled small amounts of concentrated alcohol from grain around 2,000 years ago.\n- By the 10th century, distillation was practiced in Europe, and by the 13th century, it became a commercial product.\n\n**Development in Europe**\n- Significant quantities of distilled alcohol were produced in Europe around 1100 at the medical school in Salerno, Italy.\n- Arnald of Villanova called the active principle of wine \"aqua vitae\" (\"water of life\").\n- Variants of this term include \"aqua vit,\" \"eau de vie,\" \"whisky\" (from \"water of life\" in Gaelic), and \"usquebaugh\" (Irish and Scots usage). \n- Distilled alcohol was thought by alchemists to be a quintessence: a fundamental element as foundational as earth, water, air, and fire.\n\n**From Medicine to Pleasure and Drug of Oblivion**\n- *Aqua vitae* was initially produced in monasteries and used as a medicinal cordial.\n- The shift to recreational use began to appear more prominently in texts and laws from the 15th century.\n- The term \"brandy,\" derived from the Dutch word for burning, began to refer to distilled wine aimed to prevent spoilage during transport.\n- By the 16th century, gin was distilled from rye with added juniper for flavor, primarily in northern Europe. \n- Renowned brands like France’s Cognac emerged later, with rum following in the 1620s, originally distilled from molasses.\n\n**Etymology of Distill**\n- The word \"distill\" originates from the Latin \"distillare,\" meaning \"to drip.\"\n- Describes the process where vapors from a hot liquid condense and materialize on a cooler surface.\n\nThese developments illustrate the evolution of distillation from a scientific and medicinal practice to a widely enjoyed method of alcohol production across different cultures and regions."

THE FRENCH DRINK AN AVERAGE OF 14 GALLONS (52 LITERS) OF WINE PER PERSON PER YEAR.**\n\nFrance produces more fine wines than any other country in the world. This fact alone has elevated some French wines to almost mythic status. Indeed, French winemaking techniques, viti-cultural practices, even French grape varieties have been adopted by wine regions around the world. Like French food, French wine has been (and largely remains) the benchmark against which greatness elsewhere is judged.\n\nBut France’s impact extends even further. The country has molded the very way we think about great wine. It was in France that the fundamental concept of terroir (the idea that the site determines the quality of the wine) became pervasive and flourished (see page 17). Traditionally the French have been so convinced that nature and geography make the wine that there has never been a French word for winemaker. Instead, the term commonly used, *vigneron*, portrays man’s role as more humble. *Vigneron* means “grape grower.”\n\nFrance’s near obsession with geography (plus numerous episodes of wine fraud, including cheap wine being passed off as more expensive wine) resulted, in the 1930s, in the development of a detailed system of regulations known as the *Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée* (AOC). This system designated those places where, today, most of the best wines in France are made, and then went on to define how those wines must be made. Given the emphasis on place of origin, most AOC wines are logically known by their geographic names (Sancerre, Côte-Rôtie, Volnay, and so on), not by the names of the grape varieties from which they are made (see France’s Wine Laws in the Appendix on Wine Laws, pages 923–924)."

Fruits are knocked from the cacti.\n  2. Pulp is scooped out manually and cooked.\n  3. After boiling and straining, the mixture reduces to a syrup with seeds and fiber.\n  4. Syrup is mixed with water (1 to 4 times its volume).\n  5.

Below is the structured content of the document's main points:\n\n### Alcohol's Influence on Wine\n1. **Aroma and Flavor**:\n   - Very high alcohol can mask other aromas of the wine.\n   - Dominant smell of alcohol might feel more like a nasal burn.\n   - Excessive alcohol leads to the wine smelling \"hot.\"\n\n2. **Taste**:\n   - High alcohol can render other flavors of wine almost meaningless.\n   - Wines with very high alcohol may taste dull due to overripe grape character.\n   - Extremely high alcohol content can make flavors seem lifeless, equating the experience to that of drinking vodka.\n\n3. **Alcohol Content Perception**:\n   - No fixed agreement on what constitutes \"very high\" alcohol content.\n   - Other wine components like tannin, acidity, and fruit can mitigate the harshness of alcohol.\n   - Wines exceeding 15% alcohol by volume are less likely to retain their elegance and distinctiveness.\n\n### Grape Acidity Details:\n- **Acid Content Changes**:\n  - As grapes ripen, acid content generally decreases from 3% to less than 1%.\n  - Sugar content increases dramatically, up to more than 24%.\n- **Optimal Harvesting**:\n  - Balancing acid and sugar levels is crucial for good wine acidity, flavor, and overall balance.\n\n### Additional Note:\n- The document mentions that ripe grapes are typically harvested quickly and placed in small, squat boxes. This method prevents damage to the grapes by ensuring that their own weight doesn’t crush them.\n\nThese points summarize the influence of alcohol on wine's taste and the consideration of acidity in grape harvesting, which ultimately affects the final quality of wine."

Fermenting bacteria are thought to have emerged relatively early from the primordial prebiotic soup, before the atmosphere had a sufficient concentration of oxygen to support or evolve aerobic life-forms. \n\n“In the first two billion years of life on Earth, bacteria—the only inhabitants—continuously transformed the planet’s surface and atmosphere and invented all of life’s essential, miniaturized chemical systems,” writes biologist Lynn Margulis. The research of Margulis and others has convinced many biologists that symbiotic relationships between fermenting bacteria and other early single-cell life-forms became permanently embodied as the first eukaryotic cells that plants, animals, and fungi comprise. As Margulis and Dorion Sagan explain in their book *Microcosmos*, the symbiosis may have begun as a predator-prey relationship:\n\nEventually some of the prey evolved a tolerance for their aerobic predators, which then remained alive and well in the food-rich interior of the host. Two types of organisms used the products of each other’s metabolisms. As they reproduced inside the invaded cells without causing harm, the predators gave up their independent ways and moved in for good.\n\nEvolution derived from such symbiosis is known as **symbiogenesis**. Microbiologists Sorin Sonea and Léo G. Mathieu elaborate on the concept: “*Symbiogenesis* with thousands of different bacterial genes has decisively enriched the limited metabolic potential of eukaryotic organisms, accelerating and facilitating their adaptation much more than would have been achieved by random mutation alone.”\n\nBacterial fermentation processes have been part of the context for all life. Fermentation plays such a broad and vital role in nutrient cycling that all beings coevolved with it, ourselves included. Through symbiosis and coevolution, bacteria fostered new forms, all facilitated by fermentation processes alone.\n```"

Here's a breakdown of the structured content:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - **Global Ranking**: Argentina ranks fifth among wine-producing countries worldwide.\n   - **Consumption**: Argentinians drink an average of 10 gallons (36 liters) of wine per person per year.\n\n2. **Historical Context and Evolution**:\n   - **Late 1980s Context**: Argentinian wine was primarily low quality—cheap, occasionally oxidized or microbial.\n   - **Consumption in the 1990s**: Until the late 1990s, Argentina had a per capita consumption of roughly 9.5 gallons (36 liters) per year, with little to no international exports, leading to domestic consumption of nearly the entire wine production.\n   - **Production Scale**: Since the mid-1960s, Argentina significantly increased its wine production, achieving a ranking between fourth and sixth globally.\n\n3. **Modern Transformation**:\n   - **Quality of Wine**: In recent times, Argentina's wines, especially Malbecs, have greatly improved in flavor and quality.\n   - **Shift in Industry Perception**: Previously seen as run-of-the-mill, Argentine wines have evolved to a more esteemed international standing.\n\n4. **Factors Influencing Quality Improvement**:\n   - **Political and Economic Stability**: Post-2000, after enduring a century's worth of political instability and economic difficulties, Argentina saw an improvement in its economic, political, and social climate, which benefited the wine industry.\n   - **External Influences**:\n     - **Chile's Example**: During the 1990s, the success seen by Chile in improving the quality and profitability of its wine industry served as an inspiration for Argentina.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - **Business Opportunities**: The new business-friendly climate, along with the inspiration from Chile, provided the motivation and framework for Argentinian wineries to enhance both the quality of their wine and their market reach, both domestically and internationally.\n\nThis text encapsulates a blend of historical review and recent developments that underscore the adaptive strategies and subsequent success of the Argentinian wine industry."

Below is the structured content of the document:\n\n1. **Introduction to South African Wine Industry**:\n   - South Africa has reversed its practices from the past whereby now 80% of all grapes are made into wine.\n\n2. **Challenges Faced**:\n   - **Geological and Climatic Blessings**: The country has an abundance of geological and climatic factors favorable for wine.\n   - **Economic and Technological Challenges**: Despite the natural advantages, the industry remains economically strained and technologically challenged.\n   - **Quality of Operations**: Many wine companies are still using poor-quality, outdated equipment and lack modern winemaking expertise.\n   - **Labor Issues**: Harvesting is often inefficient; the industry has labor problems and there have been reports of labor abuses.\n\n3. **Historical Labor Practices**:\n   - **\"Tot System\"**: Describes an old system where workers were paid in distilled alcohol instead of wages. This was officially declared illegal in 1962 but persisted for many years.\n   - **Consequences**: This system exacerbated alcoholism and brought about misery among the poorest laborers, primarily affecting black workers.\n   - **2011 Human Rights Watch Report**: Highlighted that laborers in the Western Cape’s wine and fruit industries faced appalling conditions.\n\n4. **Ethical Response and Reforms**:\n   - **Formation of W.I.E.T.A.**: In response to the ethical challenges, top wineries with ethical labor practices formed the Wine and Agriculture Industry Ethical Trade Association (WIETA).\n   - **Objective**: WIETA aims to establish and uphold fair labor standards within the industry.\n\nThe document concludes by pointing out the creation of fair labor standards as a significant transformation towards resolving the historical and ongoing issues within the South African wine industry."

Rub the 6 fish fillets on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n\n2. **Panzanella Preparation:**\n   - In a bowl, combine the bread, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, olive oil, vinegar, and basil and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the flavors to develop and the bread to soak up the oil and vinegar.\n\n3. **Grilling the Branzino:**\n   - Oil the grill rack. Place the fillets, skin side down, on the rack and grill until the skin is crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully turn the fillets over and continue to grill just until opaque in the center when tested with a knife tip, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\n4. **Serving:**\n   - Divide the panzanella evenly among 6 plates, and place the fillets on top. Spoon any dressing remaining in the bottom of the bowl over the fish. Serve at once.\n\n#### Note\n- Ask your fishmonger to fillet the fish for you. Check the fillets carefully for pin bones and remove any the fishmonger missed. If you cannot find branzino, a type of Mediterranean sea bass, substitute six 4-ounce halibut fillets."

It is structured into two main sections:\n\n### Difficulty Straining out Grains\n- **Problem Description**: When kefir is thick and gooey, it can be challenging to strain. It may clog the strainers.\n- **Solutions**:\n  - Use a spoon or clean fingers to help remove kefir grains from the strainer.\n  - Stir the kefir vigorously against the strainer to help push the thick kefir through.\n\n### Kefir Grains Not Growing\n- **Problem Description**: Kefir grains might stop growing due to reasons such as starvation, extreme temperatures, or other environmental stresses. This can lead to them eventually disintegrating.\n- **Consequences**:\n  - Kefir grains may completely stop growing and disintegrate into acidic neglected kefir.\n- **Advice**:\n  - Be attentive and caring towards the kefir grains.\n  - If grains stop producing satisfactory kefir, consider finding new grains.\n  - If grains are not growing but still fermenting milk tastefully, pamper them by:\n    - Feeding them more frequently\n    - Providing raw milk if possible\n    - Protecting them from extreme temperatures\n    - Agitating them in the milk to possibly stimulate growth \n\nThese sections offer practical advice for common issues encountered when handling kefir and maintaining the health of kefir grains."

Unlike many agricultural products, wine can improve with age and resist deterioration, earning it admiration for its defiance of time and ability to develop distinctive features.\n\n2. **Aging Potential of Wine**:\n   - Not all wines age well; only a few are designed to taste best upon release from the winery.\n   - Most wines begin to lose their appeal within six months, and a minority might become more interesting after five years, especially red wines. White wines' potential to improve drops by half this rate.\n   - It is rare for wines to taste better after a decade or more, and such wines are increasingly scarce.\n\n3. **Decision Making for Wine Consumption**:\n   - Many customers face difficulty in deciding when to consume a particular wine.\n   - There are no definitive rules for choosing which wines to drink immediately or store for future enjoyment, though some general guidelines may help determine which wines have long-term potential and which should be consumed soon.\n\n### Additional Information about Jancis Robinson:\n\n- **Professional Standing**:\n  - Jancis Robinson is noted as a prominent figure in wine communication with an international reputation.\n  - She provides content for her website and writes regularly for \"The Financial Times\", and on a semi-monthly basis for a column that is syndicated across various continents.\n  - She is also an editor of \"The Oxford Companion to Wine\" and co-author with Hugh Johnson of \"The World Atlas of Wine\", both of which are recognized globally.\n\n- **Recognition and Honors**:\n  - In 1984, she became the first person outside the wine trade to pass the rigorous Master of Wine exams.\n  - In 2003, Robinson was honored with an Order of the British Empire by the Queen, for whom she also acts as an advisor.\n\nThis content provides an insight into the considerations necessary when choosing wines for consumption, noting the intricate balance between aging potential and preferential taste timing."

    "contenu": "The document, titled \"WINE,\" details wine production processes focusing on aspects of fermentation and the handling of musts.\n\n### The Alcoholic Fermentation\n\n**Fermentation Yeasts**\n- Fermentation can begin with or without the addition of a starter culture of yeast. Wine makers can use different strains of **Saccharomyces**, or allow natural fermentation to occur from yeasts present on grape skins such as *Kloeckera, Candida, Pichia, Hansenula,* and others. \n- **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** is the most common yeast used due to its alcohol tolerance and ability to contribute flavor compounds to the wine.\n\n**Primary Yeast Functions**\n- The main function of yeast is to convert sugars to alcohol and produce various aromatic molecules.\n- These include longer-chain alcohols and esters.\n- Yeast along with grape enzymes and acids liberate aromatic molecules from the nonvolatile sugar complexes in the grape, enhancing the grape's own flavor potential.\n\n#### Conditions for Fermentation\n\n**Temperatures and Times**\n- The winemaker adjusts fermentation conditions according to the wine type.\n- Delicate white wines are typically fermented at cooler temperatures (60°F/16°C) for four to six weeks.\n- For wines needing more robust flavors, the must is fermented at slightly warmer temperatures (between 65°F and 80°F/18°C and 27°C) and remains in contact with grape skins to extract pigments, tannins, and flavor for about 4 to 14 days.\n- Carbon dioxide treatment may also be applied during this process.\n\n### Must Handling\n\n**After the Crush**\n- In making white wines, the must remains in contact with grape skins for a few hours and removed before beginning fermentation.\n- Rose and red wine musts are fermented in contact with skins and seeds to extract pigments and depth in flavor.\n\n**Substances Added to the Must**\n1. **Sulfur dioxide**: Used to suppress growth of undesirable wild yeasts and bacteria as well as to prevent oxidation.\n2. Sugar or acid (depending on grape maturity): Added to balance the grapes lacking natural sugars due to cool climates or to modify acid levels in grapes from hotter climates.\n\n**Impact of Sugar and Acid**\n- Sugars are crucial for producing stable alcohol levels, while acids help in flavor profile adjustment.\n\n### Note on Red and White Wine Differences\n- Red wines are made with the skin and seeds, requiring lower temperatures for longer periods.\n- White wines, also fermented at lower temperatures, do not involve the grape skins and seeds in the fermentation and are clarified further to prevent cloudiness when chilled.\n\n### Opposite Mentions\n- A contrasting note states that white wines are clarified at a lower temperature partly so that they don’t cloud when chilled, indicating specific processing differences between red and white wines.\n\nThis structured content from the document details comprehensive insights into the winemaking process emphasizing fermentation and must management."

It likely belongs to a section of a book discussing sugars, chocolate, and confectionery. The content is subdivided into sections discussing different sweetening products, their uses, characteristics, and culinary history.\n\n**Document Analysis**\n\n### 1. Kinds of Molasses\nThis section details the use of first and second molasses in foods, describing them as a traditional sugar form used particularly in the rural South of the United States, often bleached with sulfur dioxide. It notes that most molasses blends come from various stages of the sugar-making process, describing their range from mild to pungent. The section explains the composition which may include:\n- Light molasses: 35% sucrose, 35% invert sugars, and 2% minerals\n- Blackstrap molasses: 35% sucrose, 20% invert sugars, and 10% minerals\n\n### 2. Molasses in Cooking\nThis part discusses how molasses is used in cooking, emphasizing its complex flavor profile, making it a popular background flavor in various foods including popcorn. It highlights flavor notes such as sweet, caramel, and buttery.\n\n### 3. Cane and Sorghum Syrups\nIt elaborates on the syrups derived from cane juice, either produced directly from cane juice at sugar factories or from raw sugar at refineries. These typically contain:\n- 25-30% sucrose\n- 50% invert sugars\n\nIt mentions how these syrups have mild flavor characteristics and are often associated with caramel, butterscotch, and leafy aromas. The section also touches upon Louisiana cane syrups and the term \"high-test molasses\" which refers to a product concentrated and clarified with half of its sucrose inverted by acid or enzymes.\n\n### 4. Fruit Syrups: Ancient Saba, Modern Fruit Sweeteners\nThis section explores the evolution of fruit syrups from their ancient forms like Italian \"saba\" to modern fruit sweeteners. It notes how saba is made from grape juice cooked down to a thick syrup. Also, it mentions modern manufactured fruit syrups which are made from various fruits and typically concentrate on about 75% sugars, mainly glucose and fructose, and have a pH around 4. These syrups are pointed as different from common sugar or corn syrup, often containing significant amounts of pectin and other cell-wall carbohydrates.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEach subsection of the text serves to inform about the origin, production methods, and culinary uses of various types of syrups and molasses, depicting both their historical significance and modern adjustments in their production processes. This document is educational and detailed, likely intended for readers interested in food science, culinary arts, or history."

But not all water is the same. The biggest problem with water, from a fermentation perspective, is the presence of chlorine. Chlorine is added to municipal water supplies specifically to kill microorganisms. If you add heavily chlorinated water into mixtures you wish to ferment, you may find that the chlorine prevents fermentation altogether, or slows, changes, or inhibits it. If you are working with chlorinated tap water, it is best to remove the chlorine. You can use filters to remove chlorine from water. Or you can boil the water in an open pot; the chlorine will evaporate. The only drawback of this method is that you need to cool the water down to body temperature before you can add it into a mixture that contains the live cultures we are trying to encourage. If you can plan ahead a day or two, leave chlorinated water in an open vessel with large surface area and allow chlorine to evaporate. If you are inclined to test water, you can buy simple chlorine measuring kits at pool supply shops.\n\n---\n\n**TAP WATER**\n*Chris Chandler, Oakland, California*\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is never to add yeast to tap water that hasn’t been allowed to sit long enough to allow the chlorine to evaporate. I’ve always used filtered water, but one time the filter failed as I was mixing it up, and in haste, I finished off with tap water and added yeast almost immediately. Which killed them promptly.\n\n---"

These ingredients do not just contribute taste but assert their aromatic presence to modify and elevate the overall composition of the dish.\n\n#### Function of Strongly Aromatic Ingredients\n- Ingredients with a potent taste or aroma function primarily not through direct taste impact but by defining or redefining the flavor profiles of complex mixes.

Incorrect usage can detract from the dish rather than adding value, which is a prime directive for chefs.\n\n#### Category: Funky\n- The document also mentions a category of ingredients labeled \"funky,\" which includes:\n  - **Cabbage**\n  - **Truffles**\n  - **Aged Meats** (e.g., country ham)\n  - **Pungent Cheeses**\n  \n  Despite the struggle to name this category concisely due to the diverse nature of its ingredients, the common factor is their intense, unique flavors which set them apart, yet make them indispensable in certain culinary contexts.\n\n---\n\nThis structured description captures the major themes and insights from the document with respect to how specific ingredients are used to manipulate and enhance culinary creations through their aromatic and flavor-contributing profiles."
