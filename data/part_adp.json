    "contenu": "The document delves into the stage of wine-making that deals with the filtration and aging process of wine, specifically addressing red wines with a mention of a particular exception in Beaujolais winemaking.\n\n1. **Wine Filtration:**\n    - The wine is pumped through porous pads made from cellulose fibers to filter it.\n    - The porosity of the pads can vary, affecting the degree of filtration. Loose polish filtration uses wide-pore pads to clarify wine while preserving flavors and aromas. Tighter filtration with smaller-pore pads removes more particles but can result in a wine that tastes as bland as white bread.\n\n2. **Bottling and Aging:**\n    - After filtration, the wine is bottled and may be aged further.\n    - In the bottle, if the cork is sound, neither water nor alcohol can evaporate, and oxygen entry is limited, allowing the components in the wine to interact and merge into a harmonious state over time.\n    - Both the barrel (oxidative) and bottle (reductive) aging are crucial, working synergistically to optimize wine maturity. \n\n3. **Additional Note on Red Wine Production:**\n    - Most red wines globally follow the described process; however, an exception is noted in the production of Beaujolais wine, which uses a method known as carbonic maceration (reference to further details on carbonic maceration can be found on page 228 of the Beaujolais chapter).\n\nThe purpose of this document seems to offer insights into specific techniques and considerations in the red winemaking process, particularly highlighting the effects of different filtration methods and the importance of both types of aging processes."

    "contenu": "The document provides detailed instructions and insights into the preparation and fermentation of yogurt, including different cultural approaches. It can be structured into two distinct sections:\n\n**1. General Instructions for Yogurt Making:**\n\n- **Mixing:** Thoroughly mix the yogurt starter with a cup of heated milk until fully dissolved. Return the mix to the full pot of heated milk.\n- **Incubation:** Transfer the cultured milk to preheated jars, seal them, and place in an incubator to ferment undisturbed.\n- **Temperature and Time:** The yogurt will coagulate at 115°F/46°C within about three hours. However, fermentation at a slightly lower temperature (110°F/43°C) for a longer duration (four to eight hours) is recommended for a tangier flavor and better digestion of lactose. Fermentations can also last up to 24 hours.\n- **Troubleshooting:** If the yogurt is runny after the initial fermentation, adding hot water bottles to the incubator and extending the fermentation at a warmer temperature may help. If the yogurt doesn’t coagulate at all, it can be turned into a simple acid-curdled cheese rather than discarding the milk.\n\n**2. Kaymaklı Yogurt (by Aylin Öney Tan, Istanbul, Turkey):**\n\n- **Method Overview:** The method of making Kaymaklı yogurt largely follows the traditional process but includes specific techniques for a richer texture.\n- **Unique Techniques:** Boiling milk to a condensed state, constant stirring and aerating during heating to prevent burning and to thicken the yogurt. Pouring the hot milk from a height into setting vessels to introduce air that forms a foamy froth, which turns into clotted cream.\n- **Kaymak (Skin or Cream on Yogurt):** This is a delicacy formed during the fermentation of Kaymaklı yogurt, typically enjoyed removed and drizzled with honey at breakfast.\n\nThese instructions and variations highlight both the technical aspects of yogurt fermentation and cultural nuances in its preparation."

    "contenu": "## PORT'S CLASSIC PARTNERS\n\nPort has several classic companions, all of which are, like Port itself, profoundly flavorful: blue cheese, chocolate, roasted nuts, and crème brûlée. Vintage Port, for example, is stellar with blue cheese—especially Stilton or Gorgonzola—although mountain cheeses from Portugal (most of which have the word \"serra\" in the name) are also extraordinary. Hedonists also pair vintage Ports (as well as LBVs) with anything made from bittersweet chocolate. Indeed, fine chocolate is such a complex flavor that Port is virtually the only wine that stands up to it. As for tawnies, these Ports are explosively scrumptious when paired with almond or walnut cakes or with crème brûlée. But my favorite pairing with tawny is the orange tea cake served every afternoon at the Symington family's Malvedos Estate.\n\nApart from blending, single-quinta vintage Ports are made in the same manner as vintage Ports. They are not filtered, require significant bottle aging, and throw a sediment, so that the wine must eventually be decanted. Single-quinta vintage Ports are usually released after two years, just like vintage Ports. The wines are then aged a decade or more by the buyer. Single-quinta vintage Ports are generally slightly less expensive than vintage Ports."

    "contenu": "### THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS\n\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century, California’s wine industry was centered around Los Angeles. But in 1849, with the discovery of gold near the town of Coloma, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the wine industry took off in a new direction. Mining camps sprang up everywhere, and in their wake, so did vineyards and small wineries begun mostly by immigrants seeking their fortunes. By the 1860s, there were nearly 200,000 vines growing in the “gold counties” of northern California, and wineries there outnumbered those in other parts of the north. These were the first wineries in the state to forgo the common mission grape in favor of better varieties, such as zinfandel.\n\nIn time, the gold supply diminished and eventually dried up. The population shrank. Winemaking and grape growing slowed considerably and then, following the double blows of phylloxera and Prohibition, virtually disappeared in some areas. By the end of World War II, the Sierra Foothills were home mostly to ghost wineries and abandoned vineyards. Only one winery managed to remain continuously in operation, the D’Agostini Winery, now the Sobon Estate, in Amador County.\n\nA renaissance began in the 1970s, and today there are some one hundred wineries in the Sierra Foothills and more than 6,400 acres (2,600 hectares) planted with vines.\n\nThe region known as the Sierra Foothills is a strip of eight remote counties roughly stacked one on top of the next, from north to south. California’s capital, Sacramento, is to the west, the Nevada border to the east. Of the eight counties, the two most important are El Dorado and Amador, ruggedly beautiful regions where the spirit of the Old West and a strong sense of individualism live on.\n\nEl Dorado, a mountainous region with mostly volcanic and granitic soils, has some of the highest-elevation vineyards in California, including what is thought to be the highest of all, Madroña Vineyards, at an elevation of 3,000 feet (900 meters). Thanks to the breezes that sweep down off the 10,000-foot (3,000-meter) peaks of the Sierra Nevada, nights here are very cool. Amador County, warmer than El Dorado, is spread over lower foothills composed of granite with some sandy loam. Amador first came onto the modern scene in the 1970s with gutsy, teeth-staining, King Kong–size zinfandels that lots of red wine drinkers immediately fell in love with. The intensely flavored grapes came from very old (often pre-Prohibition) vineyards that had been kept in production as a source of fruit for home winemakers. One of the first wineries to realize the value of these old Amador vineyards was Sutter Home, in Napa Valley. In 1971, the winery released its first Amador County zinfandel, a stunning wine made from grapes from the now highly regarded Deaver Ranch, in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nEl Dorado County took its name from a mythical being—El Dorado, the golden one. According to legend, Spanish conquistadores searched for El Dorado believing he would lead them to a place of gold and riches.\n\nMost wineries of the Sierra Foothills are not yet well known, and many deserve to be, given the quality and distinct personality of the best wines. This is changing quickly."

However, it's the drying, not fermentation, that primarily preserves the meat.\n\n3. **Salting and Smoking**:\n   - In addition to drying, salting and smoking are used, particularly in cooler and less sunny environments where natural drying is less effective.\n   - Smoke adds complex flavors due to the presence of various chemicals including sugars, which break apart into molecules that contribute to the aroma.\n   - Wood smoke adds phenolics and other aromatics, imparting flavors of vanilla, clove, spiciness, and sweetness.\n   - Beyond flavor, smoke also brings antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that slow oxidation of fats and prevent growth of bacteria and fungi.\n   - However, there are concerns that residual compounds in smoke can be carcinogenic.\n\nThe text also references two experts:\n   - It mentions **Harold McGee** explaining the effect of wood smoke on food aroma.\n   - Indicates a specific discussion on smoke’s complex effects on preserved meats involving its rich flavors and potential health risks."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content extracted from the provided document titled \"MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\":\n\n---\n\n### MILKS\n\n**Milk has become the most standardized of our basic foods.** Once upon a time, people lucky enough to live near a farm could taste the pasture and the seasons in milk fresh from the cow. City life, mass production, and stricter notions of hygiene have now put that experience out of reach. Today, nearly all of our milk comes from cows of one breed, the black-and-white Holstein, kept in sheds and fed year-round on a uniform diet. Large dairies pool the milk of hundreds, even thousands of cows, then pasteurize it to eliminate microbes and homogenize it to prevent the fat from separating. The result is processed milk of no particular animal or farm or season, and therefore of no particular character. Some small dairies persist in milking other breeds, allowing their herds out to pasture, pasteurizing mildly, and not homogenizing. Their milk can have a more distinctive flavor, a rare reminder of what milk used to taste like.\n\n**Raw Milk:** Careful milking of healthy cows yields sound raw milk, which has its own fresh taste and physical behavior. But, if it’s contaminated by a diseased cow or careless handling—the udder hangs right next to the tail—this nutritious fluid soon teems with potentially dangerous microbes. The importance of strict hygiene in the dairy has been understood at least since the Middle Ages, but life far from the farms made contamination and even adulteration all too common in cities of the 18th and 19th centuries, where many children were killed by tuberculosis, undulant fever, and simple food poisoning contracted from tainted milk. In the 1820s, long before anyone knew about microbes, some books on domestic economy advocated boiling all milk before use. Early in the 20th century, national and local governments began to regulate the dairy industry and require that it heat milk to kill disease microbes. Today very few U.S. dairies sell raw milk. They must be certified by the state and inspected frequently, and the milk carries a warning label. Raw milk is also rare in Europe.\n\n### Pasteurization and UHT Treatments\n\n**In the 1860s, the French chemist Louis Pasteur studied the spoilage of wine and beer** and developed a moderate heat treatment that preserved them while minimizing changes in their flavor. It took several decades for pasteurization to catch on in the dairy. Nowadays, in industrial-scale production, it's a practical necessity. Collecting and pooling milk from many different farms increases the risk that a given batch will be contaminated; and the plumbing and machinery required for the various stages of processing afford many more opportunities for contamination. Pasteurization extends the shelf life of milk by killing pathogenic and spoilage microbes and by inactivating milk enzymes, especially the fat splitters, whose slow but steady activity can make it unpalatable. Pasteurized milk stored below 40°F/5°C should remain drinkable for 10 to 18 days.\n\n**There are three basic methods for pasteurizing milk.**\n\n1. **Batch pasteurization:** The simplest is batch pasteurization, in which a fixed volume of milk, perhaps a few hundred gallons, is slowly agitated in a heated vat at a minimum of 145°F/62°C for 30 to 35 minutes.\n2. **HTST (High-Temperature, Short-Time) method:** Industrial-scale operations use the HTST method, in which milk is pumped continuously through a heat exchanger and held at a minimum of 162°F/72°C for 15 seconds. The batch process has a relatively mild effect on flavor, while the HTST method is hot enough to denature around 10% of the whey proteins and generate the strongly aromatic gas hydrogen sulfide.\n3. **UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) method:** The third method of pasteurizing milk is the ultra-high temperature (UHT) method, which involves heating milk at 265–300°F/129–149°C.\n\nThese methods have evolved to ensure food safety while striving to maintain the flavor and nutrition as much as possible.\n\n---"

Here's the structured content of the document:\n\n### Coconut Meat and Milk\n- **Description**: Fresh coconut should feel heavy and contain enough liquid to slosh audibly when shaken. The meat is pounded or ground finely to create a mixture of oil droplets and cell debris suspended in water, known as coconut milk.\n- **Use**: Coconut milk, which is about half the volume when prepared from coconut meat, can be made into a skim layer and a thicker cream layer. It is commonly available canned.\n\n### Coconut Oil\n- **History**: Has been a significant vegetable oil since the 20th century.\n- **Properties**: Stable, produced in large quantities, and has a high melting point similar to milk fat. It contains high levels of saturated fats, which were once deemed unhealthy but are now better understood in the context of other dietary fats.\n- **Health**: The saturated fats in coconut oil are mostly myristic, lauric, and palmitic acids, which impact cholesterol levels. The perception of coconut oil has evolved as knowledge about dietary fats has broadened.\n\n### Coconut “Gelatin”\n- **Product**: Made from the seed of the coconut palm, specifically from the fermenting coconut water.\n- **Description**: A moist, translucent mass of cellulose called *nata de coco*, produced by the vinegar bacterium *Acetobacter xylinum*. It offers a crunchy texture, minimal flavor, and is often sweetened and used as a dessert in the Philippines.\n\n### Ginkgo Nuts\n- **Description**: Starchy kernels from the Ginkgo biloba tree, known for strong aromatic smell when ripe; requires processing like soaking and boiling to be edible.\n- **Usage**: Known for its mild flavor, ginkgo nuts are used both shelled and boiled.\n\n### Hazelnuts\n- **Origin**: From the Corylus tree species, particularly common in Turkey and widely cultivated in temperate Eurasia.\n- **History**: Have prehistoric uses and were employed as walking sticks and food sources in marshy grounds.\n- **Culinary Uses**: Frequently used in ancient Roman recipes (like those in Apicius’s cookbook) and are alternatives to almonds in various dishes.\n- **Trivia**: Also known as \"filberts\" in the United Kingdom, especially varieties from St. Philibert’s Day which marks when nuts begin to ripen.\n\nThe main topics of this document elaborate on various types of nuts and seeds, their properties, culinary uses, as well as historical significance and evolution in perception regarding health and uses."

It works better when mixed with other grape varieties and is suitable for less elaborate dishes like cassoulet. Spices should be balanced to avoid emphasizing the naturally high alcohol content of Grenache.\n   \n2. **With green vegetables**: Grenache can be overpowering when paired with green or cruciferous vegetables unless it's blended with other wines. The suggested approach includes adding sweet or smoky flavors, like bacon with Brussels sprouts, to mellow the vegetables.\n\n3. **With fruit**: The document describes pairing fortified Grenache with sweet summer fruits and tropical fruits such as peaches, nectarines, plums, guava, or papaya, highlighting the challenge of finding a good match.\n\nThe latter part of the document includes a structured table titled **THE CHEESE PLATE**, which suggests cheese pairings with different types of Grenache wine:\n\n```markdown\n| Type        | Cheese                           | Origin                 | Wine Pairing |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| FRESH-SOFT  | Chèvre                           | Many countries         | Rosé         |\n|             | Mascarpone                       | Italy                  | Rosé         |\n|             | Boursin                          | France                 | Rosé         |\n|             | Teleme                           | U.S.A.                 | Rosé         |\n| SOFT-RIPENED| Brie                             | U.S.A., France         | Rosé         |\n|             | Tetilla                          | Spain                  | Rosé         |\n| SEMI-HARD   | Comté                            | France                 | Rosé         |\n|             | Pecorino romano                  | Italy                  | Rosé         |\n| HARD        | Aged Cheddar                     | U.K., U.S.A.           | Dessert      |\n|             | Aged Mahón                       | Spain                  | Dessert      |\n| BLUE        | Fourme d'Ambert                  | France                 | Dessert      |\n|             | Gorgonzola                       | Italy                  | Dessert      |\n| WASHED-RIND | Morbier                          | France                 | Red, Dessert |\n|             | Taleggio                         | Italy                  | Red, Dessert |\n```\n\nThis cheese pairing guide is useful for selecting suitable cheeses to complement the distinctive characteristics of Grenache wine, depending on its preparation and style."

But the truth about umami lies somewhere in between. It definitely exists, but it is only one of many factors that create flavor in, and boost enjoyment from, foods and wines.\n\nOne of the most heated points of contention is umami’s role in food and wine pairings. As for many gastronomic questions, the answers are highly subjective. To make matters worse, umami is a slippery fish; easily confused with other sensations, it is extremely challenging to study. It's worth reviewing what we know and what we don’t know about this once mysterious “fifth taste.”\n\n- **UMAMI IS A PLEASANT TASTE SENSATION.**\n  Umami is one of at least five flavor sensations—along with sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, and acidity—that are truly “tasted” with the receptors on the tongue and mouth.\n\n**Kansas City author DOUG FROST** is one of only three people in the world to have achieved the remarkable distinctions of master sommelier and master of wine. He has written three books: *Uncorking Wine (1996)*, *On Wine (2001)*, and *Far from Ordinary Spanish Wine Buying Guide (2005)*, now in its second edition. Frost is the wine and spirits consultant for United Airlines and writes for many national publications. He spends his spare time listening to his massive punk rock and weird music collection.\n```"

Roussanne is high in alcohol, and serving it with chiles or Sriracha sauce makes the wine seem more alcoholic while crushing its enjoyable flavors.\n- Very light recipes. Very simple sand dabs or plain roasted quail can be crushed by a viscous, oak-aged example of this wine. If the wine is full, the dish needs to be full as well.\n- Foods that are overly sweet. Roussanne’s ability to pair with the exotic leads some cooks to go over the top. A little hoisin sauce, for example, can pair well with the wine, but too much can make it taste thin and bitter.\n- Strong-flavored fish. Especially with a round and fruit-forward blend, stay away from pungent fish such as sardines, anchovies, and mackerel, as well as fish sauces like the intense South-east Asian nuoc mam.\n\n### The Cheese Plate\n\n| Type         | Cheese                | Origin/Classification       | Property |\n|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------|\n| Semi-soft    | Fromage blanc         | France                     | Dry      |\n|              | Petit-Suisse          | France                     | Dry      |\n|              | Crescenza (U.S.A.)    | U.S.A.                     | Dry      |\n|              | young Mahón           | Spain                      | Dry      |\n| Soft-ripened | Camembert             | France                     | Dry      |\n|              | Explorateur           | France                     | Dry      |\n| Semi-hard    | Fontina               | Italy                      | Dry      |\n|              | vacherin fribourgeois | Switzerland                | Dry      |\n| Hard         | Mimolette             | France                     | Sparkling|\n|              | aged St. George       | U.S.A.                     | Sparkling|\n| Washed-rind  | Époisses              | France                     | Dry      |\n|              | Taleggio              | Italy                      | Dry      |"

Below is the organized structure of key terms and classifications discussed in the document:\n\n### German Wine Classifications and Terms\n\n- **Kabinett**: Pronounced CAB-i-net.\n- **Spätlese**: Pronounced SCHPATE-lay-zeh.\n- **Auslese**: Pronounced owsch-lay-zeh.\n- **Beerenauslese (BA)**: Pronounced Bear-en-owsch-lay-zeh.\n- **Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA)**: Pronounced TRAUK-en-bear-en-owsch-lay-zeh.\n- **Eiswein**: Pronounced ICE-vine.\n\n### Sweetness Categories (from dry to sweet):\n- **Trocken**: Bone dry; less than 0.9 percent residual sugar.\n- **Halbtrocken; sometimes called Feinherb**: Half dry; less than 1.8 percent residual sugar.\n- **Lieblich or Mild**: Some sweetness; up to 4.5 percent residual sugar.\n\n### Ripeness and Sweetness in Wines\n- Ripeness depends on the sugar levels of grapes influenced by when they are harvested.\n- Sweetness is determined by residual sugar in the final wine and is measured in grams.\n- The ripeness categories depend on the Oechsle scale which measures must weight.\n- Generally, the scope can deliver wines in three levels of sweetness: \n  - **kabinett trocken**: Very little ripe but dry.\n  - **kabinett halbtrocken**: A more ripened version, still dry.\n  - **kabinett lieblich**: Ripened grapes with a slight sweetness.\n  - This concept applies similarly to other categories like spätlese, auslese, etc.\n\n### Wine Harvest and Production:\n- Vineyards harvest grapes depending on targeted ripeness levels.\n- Bad weather may prompt selective harvesting to produce different kinds of wine:\n  - **Spätlese**: Fuller-bodied late harvest wine.\n  - **Auslese**: Even richer late harvest wine.\n- Wine types such as **eiswein** require freezing conditions post-harvest to develop richer tastes.\n\n### Notable Points:\n- The document educates about German wine sweetness levels and how ripeness impacts wine character.\n- The differences between various types of wine classifications are portrayed by how grapes are picked and processed depending on weather conditions and sugar content. Turnaround strategies in adverse weather are also highlighted in relation to creating diverse types of wines like spätlese, auslese, etc."

    "contenu": "The text provides detailed guidance on dealing with mold in fermented foods. Here's a breakdown of the content structured for clarity:\n\n### Instructions for Removing Mold from Fermented Foods\n\n1. **Removing Surface Mold**\n   - Utilize a wide stainless-steel spoon to gently remove mold from the surface of the ferment.\n   - Skim off as much mold as possible. In wet or dry ferments, you may need to remove a plate or lid to facilitate this.\n   - If not all mold can be removed and dissipates into small bits, remove as much as possible but do not worry if some remains, as long as it is white.\n\n2. **Types of Mold and Safety Precautions**\n   - White mold is typically not harmful.\n   - Avoid eating the ferment if colorful molds develop, as bright colors indicate spore production (sporulation), a mold’s reproductive stage.\n   - To prevent spreading mold spores, gently lift the entire mold mass from the ferment if possible.\n   - Colorful molds are sometimes preceded by white molds and if present in a cohesive mass, can be entirely removed.\n\n3. **Implications of Leaving Mold on the Ferment**\n   - The longer mold remains, the deeper its mycelia can penetrate the ferment, which can digest pectins leading to mushy vegetables.\n   - Consuming moldy vegetables can lead to a taste of mold and can also deactivate lactic acid, critical for preservation.\n   - It’s important to remove mold promptly to maintain the safety and quality of the ferment. After removing mold, assess the texture of the underlying vegetables and discard any that have softened due to mold growth.\n\n4. **Barrier Techniques to Prevent Mold Contact with Vegetables**\n   - Using cabbage leaves as a barrier:\n     - For jars, fold an outer cabbage leaf to fit between the shredded vegetables and the surface.\n     - For larger vessels, arrange leaves in an overlapping circle or spiral to protect the ferment.\n   - Lisa Milton’s method:\n     - Wash and tightly roll the outer cabbage leaves into a cigar shape and place them side by side on the ferment for an added barrier.\n\nThis step-by-step approach emphasizes precautions, practical techniques for mold removal, and methods to prevent mold from affecting the quality of fermented foods."

This spurred the opening of additional factories, revitalizing sugar availability.\n- By the late 1840s, the sugar industry had regained momentum, and since then, it has continued to flourish.\n\n#### Sugar in Modern Times\n- Currently, beet sugar represents about 30% of the worldwide sucrose production primarily from Russia, Germany, and the United States, with California, Colorado, and Utah as notable contributors. The Caribbean, once a major source, now plays a minor role.\n\n#### The Nature of Sugars\n- Ordinary sugar is classified as one of several chemical forms.\n\n#### Recipes from the 17th Century\n1. **Caramelle**\n   - Ingredients: Sugar, amber, almond oil, sweet almonds.\n   - Directions: Cook sugar until it reaches a burning smell, remove from heat, mix with amber, rub a marble or plate with almond oil, throw caramel onto it, add sweet almonds, and mix using a spoon.\n\n2. **Twisted Sugar**\n   - Ingredients: Sugar, sweet-almond oil.\n   - Directions: Cook sugar until it burns, throw it on a marble stone rubbed with sweet-almond oil, rub hands with oil, and shape it using iron hooks.\n\n3. **Slices of Ham**\n   - Ingredients: Sugar, lemon juice, Provence roses, pomegranate or barberry juice.\n   - Directions: Cook sugar to a feather-like texture, divide among three containers with different flavorings, layer it to mimic ham thickness, and cut it into slices.\n\nThese recipes illustrate the historical creativity and complexity of confectionery in the 17th century."
