Includes true cantaloupes and muskmelons.\n  - **Winter Melons:** Less aromatic and less perishable, with smooth or wrinkled rinds. Includes honeydews, casabas, and canaries.\n\n### Melon Ripening\n- **Vine-ripening:** Important for all melons as they don't store starch and become sweeter after harvest. A remnant of the stem on an aromatic melon indicates it was harvested before becoming fully ripe.\n- **Aroma Consistency:** The aroma of naturally ripened melons may differ off the vine and will not be the same as the aroma of vine-ripened melons.\n\n### Varieties of Melons\n\n#### Summer Melons\n- **Cantaloupe:** Smooth or lightly netted, orange flesh, rich flavor.\n- **Muskmelon:** Deeply netted, sometimes misnamed “cantaloupe” in the U.S.\n- **Galia, Ha Ogen, Rocky Ford:** Green flesh, sweet and aromatic.\n- **Ambrosia, Sierra Gold:** Orange flesh.\n- **Persian:** Large, orange, mild.\n- **Sharlyn/Ananas:** Translucent pale flesh.\n- **Pancha (charentais x muskmelon):** Netted and ribbed, orange, very aromatic.\n\n#### Winter Melons\n- **Honeydews:** Smooth rind, green or orange flesh, sweet, mild aroma.\n- **Casaba, Santa Claus:** Wrinkled or smooth rind, white flesh, less sweet or aromatic than honeydew.\n- **Canary:** Slightly wrinkled rind, white flesh, crisp, aromatic.\n\n### Hybrids\n- **Crenshaw (Persian x casaba):** Green-yellow wrinkled rind, orange flesh, juicy, aromatic."

Hot water can help soften seeds by dissolving and relocating carbohydrates and starches, thereby making the nutrients more digestible.\n- **Cooking Techniques:**\n  - **Soaking:** Milling or cutting seeds into smaller pieces removes outer coats, reducing cooking time. Soaking seeds reduces cooking times significantly.\n  - **Heating:** Faster penetration of heat into seeds reduces cooking time even further than water alone.\n\n### Sprouts\n\n**Main Points:**\n- **Benefits of Sprouting:**\n  - Enhances the nutritional content of seeds, particularly in vitamins C and B, iron, and protein.\n  - Transition from dry seed to a sprout offers a midway nutritional value and changes chemically and texturally.\n- **Common usage:** Commonly sprouted seeds include beans and barley. They become sweeter as stored starch is converted into sugars.\n\n### Turning Seeds into Meat Substitutes\n\n**Main Points:**\n- **Use in Vegetarian Cuisine:** Particularly popular among Buddhists in China and Japan.\n- **Methods:** Involves using whole grains, beans, and nuts along with wheat gluten or soybean extract (like seitan and yuba) manipulated to mimic meat textures and flavors.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The text emphasizes how different processing techniques alter cooking times and nutritional availability of seeds in culinary applications, while also offering options for vegetarians to create meat-like dishes from various seeds and their derivatives."

The document explains that as the fermentation environment becomes more acidic, there is a shift toward acid-tolerant homolactic bacteria like *Lactobacillus plantarum*, which characterizes later stages of fermentation. The success of processes such as sauerkraut fermentation is largely dependent on the relationship between heterofermentative and homofermentative lactobacilli.\n\nFurthermore, the document highlights the importance of LAB in food safety and preservation, as their production of lactic acid helps inhibit the growth of spoilage-causing bacteria. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization titled \"Fermented Fruits and Vegetables: A Global Perspective\" is cited, which discusses the diversity and metabolic capability of LAB.\n\nAdditionally, it touches on the natural exposure and importance of LAB to humans, from newborns who are first exposed at birth, to adults, suggesting that LAB exposure continues through breast-feeding and daily life via food and environment. It raises concerns about the constant attack on these bacteria by antibacterial chemicals and stresses the need for their replenishment in our bodies.\n\n**References Extracted:**\n- Footnote 4: Discusses characteristics of LAB in later fermentation stages.\n- Footnote 5: References the symbiotic relationships in sauerkraut fermentation.\n- Footnote 6: Cites the UN FAO report on the effectiveness of LAB.\n- Footnote 7: Discusses exposure to LAB from birth through adulthood, also mentioning \"The War on Bacteria\" in this context."

The text suggests that costs related to shipping them can be high.\n- **Purchasing Options:** One can purchase Ohio Stoneware crocks through Ace Hardware’s site, with an option for free shipping to a local Ace store. Bulk purchases directly from the manufacturer could offer substantial savings.\n- **Handling Cracks:**\n  - **Testing for Leaks:** Fill the crock with water, mark the water level, and observe if the water level changes over 24 hours to check for hairline cracks.\n  - **Concerns and Cleaning:** Small hairline cracks do not necessarily compromise the crock but can harbor molds and microbes. Cleaning such cracks with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide followed by soapy water is recommended.\n- **Microbial Concerns:** The effectiveness of fermentation in crocks depends on maintaining a sufficient mass of beneficial fermentation organisms that can outcompete incidental environmental microbes.\n\n### Illustration\n- The document includes a sketch of a mandolin slicer, which appears unrelated to the text about ceramic crocks but may suggest a context of food preparation or kitchenware.\n\nThis document likely aims to inform readers, possibly fermentation enthusiasts, about managing and selecting appropriate ceramic crocks for fermenting foods like sauerkraut."

    "contenu": "# IF MONEY WERE NO OBJECT\n\nLet's say you were willing to pay $20,000 to $36,000 per case for Château Pétrus (the cost for contemporary vintages). How would you go about buying it? Alas, the process wouldn't be easy—Pétrus is rarely available. Here's why.\n\nEach year, 2,500 to 3,000 cases of Pétrus are made. In the United States, as one example, about four hundred of these cases are allocated to Pétrus's United States importer. The importer, in turn, offers the wine to a small, select group of wholesalers around the country who have consistently bought Pétrus in the past. These wholesalers, in turn, offer their limited allotments only to a small, select group of exclusive wine shops and a few prestigious restaurants that have seniority based on their past record of purchases.\n\nA wine shop or restaurant will offer the wine, often personally, to a select group of customers, mostly collectors who buy Pétrus every year regardless of the cost.\n\nIt can be next to impossible to break into this loop.\n\n# LISTRAC AND MOULIS\n\nListrac and Moulis are inland communes of the Médoc, that is, they are not positioned on the gravelly banks of the Gironde Estuary like their more famous sisters, Margaux, St.-Julien, Pauillac, and St.-Estephe. Away from the riverbanks, the soil tends to be heavier and to hold more water. As a result, the wines of Listrac and Moulis (based on cabernet sauvignon, with merlot and cabernet franc added) are generally rougher-textured and less polished, but also a fraction of the cost. They can sometimes seem straitjacketed by tannin. There are exceptions. Several of the best Crus Bourgeois, for example, are here, including Château Poujeaux, Château Chasse-Spleen, and Château Fourcas-Hosten.\n\n# ENTRE-DEUX-MERS\n\nEntre-Deux-Mers (literally “between two seas”) is the vast expanse of rolling hills and forested land between the Dordogne and Garonne tributaries of the Gironde Estuary. Although it is a large wine region and a picturesque one, the wines are generally very simple and are never as high in quality as the wines of the Médoc, Graves, Pomerol, or St.-Émilion.\n\nIt's important to know that the appellation Entre-Deux-Mers applies to dry white wines only. These are primarily sauvignon blanc, sometimes with a bit of sémillon and muscadelle, which adds a faint spicy-flowery quality. They are fresh, zesty, and light—perfect for pairing with fish and shellfish, or just for plain pleasure. A significant amount of red wine is made here, too, but because these wines are often lower in quality than the region's whites, they must carry the appellation Bordeaux or Bordeaux Supérieur, not Entre-Deux-Mers."

Below are the structured highlights and details covered in the article:\n\n### 1. Importance of Color in Wine Perception\n- **General view**: The color of a wine is often seen as setting up expectations regarding its aromas and flavors.\n- **Author's perspective**: The color is not necessarily linked to aroma or flavor and is considered last in the evaluation process by the author.\n\n### 2. Origin of Wine Color\n- **Source**: Derived from pigments in grape skins known as anthocyanins.\n- **Viewing technique**: Recommends looking down and across a wine-filled glass at a 45-degree angle, rather than directly holding the glass up.\n\n### 3. Varietal Differences in Color\n- Examples of grape varietal colors:\n  - **Pinot noir**: Usually light brick in color.\n  - **Gamay**: Lipstick red.\n  - **Zinfandel and Nebbiolo**: Electric purple to almost black, depending on the specific wine.\n\n### 4. Color as an Indicator\n- **Age relation**: Color can indicate the age of wine; white wines darken as they age, whereas red wines generally lighten.\n  \n### 5. Flavor Intensity Misconception\n- **Common misconception**: Many think the intensity of wine’s color relates directly to the intensity of its flavor.\n- Confirms that deeply red wines (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon) are not necessarily more flavorful than paler red wines (e.g., Pinot Noir).\n\n### 6. Clarity of Wine\n- **Importance today**: Clarity or limpidity is relevant, with well-made white wines generally having good clarity.\n- **Variability in red wines**: Clarity can vary; some great reds have perfect clarity while others might be more opaque, especially those unfiltered.\n\nThe article emphasizes understanding the nuances of wine color and how it can both influence and mislead in wine tasting and appreciation."

Below is the detailed breakdown of the document:\n\n### TOPPING\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - 3 tablespoons butter\n  - ½ cup sliced (raw) almonds\n  - 4 tablespoons small brined capers\n  - 2 shallots, finely diced\n  - Kosher salt\n  - Freshly ground white pepper\n  - 1 tablespoon chopped parsley\n\n- **Instructions:**\n  1. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the almonds and toast, stirring frequently until fragrant and golden, about 1½ minutes.\n  2. Transfer the almonds to a plate and wipe out the skillet.\n  3. Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan and heat over medium-high. Add the capers and crisp. Return the almonds to the pan and add the shallots.\n  4. When they begin to color, swirl in the remaining butter. Season with salt and pepper and add the parsley.\n\n### SCALLOPS\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - ½–2/3 pound bay scallops, rinsed and patted dry\n  - 2 tablespoons corn or other vegetable oil\n  - ½ tablespoon butter (optional)\n  - Kosher salt\n  - Freshly ground white pepper\n\n- **Instructions:**\n  1. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Get it good and hot. Add the scallops and sauté—the flesh is delicate, so resist the temptation to move them around—until they are golden on one side, about 1 minute.\n  2. Flip them over and cook about 30 seconds more. Optionally, finish them off with butter.\n  3. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n### PLATING\n- **Instructions:**\n  - Spoon the glaze onto four plates. Divide the scallops among the plates. Spoon the topping over the scallops and serve.\n\n### OUR TASTE NOTES\n- **Description:**\n  - First, you get the salt from the soy from the glaze. Then, there is the vinegary tang and sweetness from the Madeira and rice wine vinegar in the glaze.\n\nThis recipe provides a detailed guide on how to prepare and serve a scallops dish with a specific almond and caper topping."

The mention \"controlled appellation\" is often included between the terms \"appellation\" and \"controlled.\"\n- Classify the wines separately and remember to mention the volumetric alcohol content expressed in % (e.g., live including 12.5% vol).\n- For wines served by the glass, if they are not visible on the wine list, they should at least be mentioned on sales supports or displayed in some way.\n\n---\n\nThis critical analysis helps with understanding not only the requirements for a proper wine list but also the common pitfalls to avoid in its creation, ensuring compliance and consumer satisfaction."

    "contenu": "## Prosecco\n\n**Pronunciation**:\n- proh-seh-koh\n- praw-sehk-koh\n  \n### Description\nDespite its recent popularity as a sort of soda pop among celebrities, Prosecco is a tasty, fun, affordable sparkling wine. This enjoyable drink has surpassed Asti Spumante as Italy’s number-one exported sparkling wine—and there’s a lot of Asti Spumante in the world. Happily, most of us have been embracing Prosecco for what it is—an enjoyable, food-friendly effervescent sipper—and not as a fashion statement to be sipped through a fluorescent-colored straw.\n\n### Alternative Names\n- Balbi\n- Glera\n- Serprina\n- Tondo (Italy)\n\n### Styles\nLight- to medium-bodied dry white, rosé (relatively rare), dry to sweet sparkling\n\n### Sometimes Blended With\n- Bianchetta\n- Pereza\n- Pinot Bianco\n- Verdiso\n\n### Flavor Lexicon\n- **Fruit**: Apple, citrus rind, pear\n- **Floral**: Citrus blossom, honeysuckle, narcissus\n- **Other**: Bitter almond, honey\n\n### Similar Sips\nFruit-forward sparkling wines, such as those from California, but with a touch more sweetness; drier, less overtly fruity versions of Asti Spumante\n\n### Where It’s Grown\n- Argentina\n- Italy (Friuli–Venezia Giulia; Veneto: Cartizze, Conegliano-Valdobbiadene)\n\n### Commentary\nProsecco’s phenomenal success has created a legion of critics. Most claim that it can’t compete with Champagne, California sparkling wine, or anything else with bubbles. I reply that they are missing the boat and overthinking the issue. Prosecco is about food and enjoyment, not bubble size, tirage time, or chalky soils.\n\nNative to Italy’s Veneto region and said to have originated in the town of Prosecco (now a suburb of burgeoning Trieste), Prosecco is the name of the grape, the region, and the wine. This doesn’t happen often: France’s Muscadet is the only other example I can come up with offhand. Cava, the popular Spanish sparkling wine, comes from Spain’s Cava region in Catalonia, but it incorporates grapes that don’t share the Cava name. But Prosecco has other things in common with these wines."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content provided:\n\n### Indigo Dye Fermentation\n- **Process Description**:\n  - Indigo dyeing involves a reduction process in an anaerobic environment where the dye loses its blue color.\n  - It's important to minimize the vat's disturbance as it can introduce oxygen, which impedes the dye’s reduction.\n  - Over time, the vat develops a fishy odor, and when a coppery sheen is visible on the surface, it indicates readiness for dyeing.\n  - Fibers or garments are initially yellow-green when dipped and turn blue upon exposure to air due to oxidation.\n  - For a darker blue, multiple dippings are required, allowing full oxidation between each dip.\n- **Cultural and Academic References**:\n  - Indigo is not the only fermented dye; others are used by the Meitei ethnic group in Manipur, India.\n  - Dr. S. Sekar of Bharathidasan University has compiled a database which includes a variety of traditional dyes and adhesives developed through fermentation processes.\n\n### Natural Building\n- **Overview**:\n  - Utilizing natural materials is the foundational method for building construction.\n  - Currently, a significant portion of the global population still lives in earthen dwellings.\n  - These traditional homes are considered more thermally comfortable compared to modern concrete structures.\n  - The use of earth and other natural materials is emphasized in the book \"Clay Culture,\" written by Carole Crews.\n\nThe document provides an informative look at traditional methods and materials in both dye making and construction, highlighting cultural practices and the advantages of such methods."

But that’s only if the bottle is open; in an unopened bottle, the gas is still dissolved in the wine and thus, in an unopened bottle, there is only the **potential** for bubbles. The 100 million figure comes from Gérard Liger-Belair, PhD, in the department of physics at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, in France, where he has been conducting bubble research for more than a decade.\n\nThrough the use of special high-speed cameras, Liger-Belair has also discovered that bubbles play a part in determining the aromas a drinker smells. Each bubble appears to contain hundreds of chemical components, some of which can affect taste, aroma, and feel. When the bubble bursts on the surface of the wine, tiny droplets of Champagne are projected into the air, allowing the drinker to smell the wine more acutely.\n\n![Research in the cold cellars 120 feet (36 meters) underground. I think I was wearing four layers of clothing.](image url)\n\nIn Champagne, bubble size and persistency are signs of quality. Tiny bubbles, considered the best, are the result of a long aging on the yeasts and the temperature of the aging cellar (the cooler the smaller). Equally important is how the bubbles behave in the glass. A high-quality Champagne will have streams of bubbles arising from different spots in the liquid (as many as fifty bubbles per second), coming together to create a spiraling cascade. At the top of the glass, these collect to form a snowy layer called the mousse. Champagne makers insist that the feel of the bubbles should be extremely delicate (nothing like, for example, the harsh, large bubbles in, say, a cola)."

It’s fun to sit at the bar and become part of the creative process. I’ll throw out a couple of ingredients or flavors, and they’ll create a new cocktail around them on the spot. They talk about balance, textures, and flavors the same way chefs do in the kitchen. Sometimes they engage me about a dish I’m working on and give me a new perspective on how to put it together.\n\nIn many ways Death & Co has become one of the city’s centers of creativity. The bartenders love to experiment and are not afraid to fail. More importantly, they help each other work through ideas. This is how the best restaurant kitchens work, as well. At Death & Co, the customer becomes a key component of the process. The bartenders will share drinks they’re working on and ask guests for feedback, then make it again. The more people you let into the process, the better the final product becomes. Nothing is proprietary, and there’s no need to worry about your idea getting picked up and improved upon by the next guy.\n\nThe most important part of the creative process is having a firm understanding of the classics. Without this knowledge, creativity becomes novelty, not innovation. The reason the bartenders at Death & Co excel at innovation is because they have such a strong skill set and understanding of the classics.\n\nI usually come to Death & Co after I’m done in the kitchen for the night, so I get there not long before last call. The old-fashioned is my default cocktail. It has a balance of bitter, sweet, and acidity that I appreciate. Tiki drinks have also taught me a lot about balance. With so many flavors and ingredients coming together in a glass, they are exceptionally hard to make right, yet a properly made tiki drink strikes a harmony you want to keep experiencing.\n\nI tend to avoid clear, stirred drinks. They typically don’t have enough going on for me. But one night Alex introduced me to the White Negroni. It had that balance of bitterness, booziness, and sweetness that I love. I’d already drunk so much that I couldn’t finish my Negroni, so I dumped it into my coffee thermos and threw it in my backpack. The next night I pulled it out at a restaurant and poured it over ice. It was the ultimate roadie drink.\n```"

Wine styles range from simple to toasty and oaky, in the manner of many California chardonnays.\n\n- **TORRONTÉS**: An Argentine specialty, with three distinct varieties: Torrontés Riojana (delightful, dry, spicy, aromatic), Torrontés Sanjuanino (a natural cross of muscat of Alexandria and listán prieto), Torrontés Mendocino (not as aromatic or high in quality, with parentage slightly known as muscat of Alexandria).\n\n---\n\n## REDS\n\n- **BARBERA, SANGIOVESE, AND TEMPRANILLO**: Introduced by early Italian and Spanish immigrants, used mainly in inexpensive blends, sold in jugs or cartons, sometimes as varietal wines.\n\n- **BONARDA**: Formerly Argentina’s main red grape, now second to malbec. Known for its bold, balanced wines that can have some complexity with age. It is a French grape douce noir, called charbono in California.\n\n- **CABERNET SAUVIGNON**: Important for the export market, it offers powerful and sleek wines.\n\n- **CEREZA**: An inexpensive variety used in wines sold in cartons domestically, it’s a cross of listán prieto and muscat of Alexandria.\n\n- **CRIOLLA CHICA**: The same as listán prieto, it's the original grape variety from Spain, brought to Argentina.\n\n- **CRIOLLA GRANDE**: An undistinguished pinkish-skinned grape related to other criollas, used for coarse, bland white and rosé wines.\n\n- **MALBEC**: The most important and impressive red grape in Argentina, originally from Cahors, France. Known for producing wines with gripping, deep, concentrated, and velvety textures.\n\n- **MERLOT**: Although less prestigious and successful compared to cabernet sauvignon, it still offers good value, mostly for the export market.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured information highlights the primary grape types and their attributes in Argentine viticulture."

It explores how temperature influences the taste and overall experience of drinking wine, drawing from the author's observations in wine classes.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Experiment Description**:\n   - In wine classes, the author presents two red wines, labeled A and B, concealed to prevent bias. Despite being the same wine, B is served slightly cooler by about three degrees than A. The participants commonly prefer wine B, highlighting that even minor temperature differences can significantly affect the wine's reception.\n\n2. **Temperature's Impact on Wine Characteristics**:\n   - **Cooler Temperature Effects (White Wine)**: Enhances acidity and makes the wine taste lighter and fresher. If too cold, it can numb taste buds, making the wine nearly tasteless.\n   - **Warmer Temperature Effects (White Wine)**: As temperature increases, it can make high-alcohol wines taste harsh and almost caustic.\n   - **Red Wine Temperature Sensitivity**: Serving red wine too warm can make it taste more alcoholic and coarse. Ideal serving recommendations for red wines often involve chilling the bottle in a mix of ice and water to precisely around 65°F (18°C), rather than serving at room temperature, which may be too warm and can distort the wine's flavors.\n\n3. **General Guidelines for Red Wine**:\n   - Suggest chilling red wine just enough to reach a balanced, focused state with pronounced fruit flavors. The document advises imagining the temperature of a movie theater in summer as a good reference.\n\n4. **Exceptions**:\n   - Some wines, like very fruity, low-tannin red wines (e.g., Beaujolais), benefit from being cooled almost as much as white wines to enhance their fruitiness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe document effectively argues that the serving temperature of wine is crucial in shaping its taste profile and overall enjoyment. It provides practical tips on achieving the ideal temperatures for different types of wines to maximize their pleasing characteristics."

They are produced by leaving grapes to freeze naturally on the vine, then harvesting them. The process of freezing and thawing concentrates the flavor and sugar in the grapes.\n- **Regions**: Prominent in cold-climate regions like Canada, Germany, and Austria.\n- **Characteristics**: Recognized for their depth of flavor and high sugar levels balanced with acidity.\n- **Pairings**: Best paired with rich, savory foods such as triple cream cheeses and foie gras. Despite their sweetness, Icewines are versatile enough to complement a broad range of desserts like flourless chocolate cake and mango mousse.\n\n### Botrytis-Affected Dessert Wines\n- **Description**: These wines are influenced by the Botrytis cinerea fungus, also known as \"noble rot,\" which infects grapes left on the vine in cool, not cold, regions. The fungus facilitates moisture evaporation, hastening the sugar concentration process while maintaining high acidity.\n- **Examples**: Sauternes, Beerenauslese, and Tokaji Aszú are classic wines affected by botrytis.\n- **Characteristics**: Botrytis imparts a honeyed aroma and flavor to the wines.\n- **Versatility**: Considered highly versatile, these wines can pair well with both funky cheeses, like bleus and country pâtés, and sweet desserts that provide caramel and custard flavors, such as apple tarte tatin and peach cobbler.\n\nEach wine type has been elaborated upon to include the methods of production, characteristic features, prominent regions of production, and typical food pairings, thereby providing a comprehensive look at these dessert wines."
