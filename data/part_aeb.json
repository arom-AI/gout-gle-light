    "contenu": "The document presents a detailed visual and textual depiction of the aroma profile of strawberries. Below is a structured content summarization and description:\n\n### Title:\n**Strawberry**\n\n### Main Visual Analysis:\nThe image is a circular graphic showcasing the different aroma components found in strawberries. The key aromatic categories are highlighted along the circumference of the circle, each distinct in color and labeled with specific aroma sub-categories:\n\n1. **Fruity**\n   - Banana\n   - Pear\n   - Tropical\n   - Peach\n\n2. **Floral**\n   - Lemon\n   - Geranium\n   - Floral\n   - Rose\n\n3. **Green**\n   - Cut grass\n   - Green\n\n4. **Citrus**\n   - Lemon\n   - Orange\n   - Grapefruit\n\n5. **Others**\n   - Creamy\n   - Spicy\n   - Woody\n   - Caramel\n\n### Textual Description:\n**Strawberry aroma profile**\nThe text explains that strawberries have a fruity, floral aroma profile due to a variety of volatile organic compounds like esters. Low concentrations of furaneol add sweetness and a fruity flavor with pineapple undertones. The volatiles increase during the ripening process and are formed by enzymatic reactions. The key aromas that characterize a ripe strawberry include fruity, floral, caramel, and cheesy notes, and depending on the variety, some strawberries also have citrus notes.\n\n### Table of Food Pairings:\nThe bottom of the document contains a table indicating how well strawberries pair with various foods based on their aroma compatibility. Here’s a structured Markdown representation:\n\n```markdown\n| Food Item            | Aroma Compatibility with Strawberry |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Butter               | ●●●          |\n| Dark Chocolate       | ●●●●●        |\n| Cream Cheese         | ●●●●         |\n| Coconut Water        | ●           |\n| Grilled Lamb         | ●●●         |\n| Morilles Cheese      | ●●●●●        |\n| Borage               | ●●          |\n| Peanut Butter        | ●●●●         |\n| Roasted Sunflower Seeds | ●●●       |\n| Boiled Chayote Squash | ●          |\n```\nEach “●” represents a level of compatibility ranging from one to five. The more circles, the stronger the compatibility of the aroma with strawberries.\n\n### Page Number:\n69\n\nThis document not only educates about the rich and complex aroma profile of strawberries but also guides on pairing foods based on aroma compatibility, making it valuable for culinary and gastronomic enthusiasts."

Chile is unique as the only major wine-producing country where phylloxera does not exist. This is credited to a combination of physical isolation, dry soil, and use of flood irrigation which are not hospitable to the pest. Though neighboring Argentina has phylloxera, Chile's stringent quarantine procedures for plant materials have helped avoid its spread.\n\nDespite the advantage of using phylloxera-resistant rootstock in some parts of Chile, not all vineyards employ this technique. Some argue that the taste from vines grown directly on their own roots is superior, though this has not been empirically demonstrated. It is noted that planting on rootstock is significantly more costly than using vines with their own roots.\n\n## Mid-20th Century Chilean Wine Industry\nFor much of the 20th century, the Chilean wine industry was largely unremarkable, limited by political instability, bureaucratic challenges, high taxes, and low wages. Additionally, the domestic market was content with inexpensive wines, which further restricted the ambitions and growth of local winemakers.\n\n## Modern Changes and Investment\nIn the late 1980s, shifts in Chile’s political, economic, and social landscapes led to significant increases in both domestic and foreign investments in the wine sector. These changes transformed Chile from a lower-tier wine producer into what is now referred to as the \"Bordeaux of South America.\" Prominent European wine families, including the Torres from Spain and the Rothschilds from Château Lafite-Rothschild, invested in Chile, specifically targeting regions like Curicó and Colchagua. Key figures such as Paul Pontallier from Bordeaux’s Château Margaux and Bruno Prats also contributed to this revolution.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe influx of knowledge, experience, and investment catalyzed by these factors played critical roles in ushering in a new era for Chilean wine, marking its transition to a fine wine producer on the global stage. Through these efforts, not only has the quality of Chilean wine improved, but the industry has also gained significant recognition and prestige internationally."

Heavier toasts, which have a charred-smoke flavor, are more commonly used for whiskey.\n\n### Section 2: MARNIE’S CORNER\nThis section titled \"Marnie's Corner\" highlights the role of oak in wine and spirit aging. It explains that while wine is made entirely from grapes, the flavor of oak is a significant foreign influence in winemaking. It notes that oak's scent is distinctive and shares similarities with those found in brown spirits such as whiskey and brandy. French oak gives a toasty vanilla aroma, predominant in Cognac, while American oak is noted for a more distinctive, coconut-like character, especially observed in Bourbon and California brandy."

Do not confuse extra dry with EXTRA BRUT, which is the driest dosage level.\n\nF:\n    Foudre:\n        Definition: Large wooden vat used to age wines.\n\nG:\n    Gargigue:\n        Definition: A word used to describe the arid landscape of Provence and the southern Rhône, covered with dry scrub and tough, resiny wild herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, and lavender. The wines of Provence and the southern Rhône are said to smell and taste of garrigue (garrigue in French).\n    Goût de Terroir:\n        Definition: The distinctive taste of a given grape variety grown in a specific TERROIR.\n    Grande Marque:\n        Definition: A member of a particular association of about thirty of the longest-established Champagne houses. The Syndicat de Grandes Marques is devoted to upholding a written charter of high standards in the production of Champagne.\n\nH:\n    House:\n        Definition: In the Champagne region, house refers to a producer who sells Champagne under its own brand name. The grapes may come from its own vineyards, from independent growers, or most often from a combination of the two. Such firms as Veuve Clicquot, Moët & Chandon, and Taittinger are all referred to as houses.\n\nL:\n    Left Bank:\n        Definition: The term refers to all of the appellations of Bordeaux that are on the left side of the Gironde River as it flows out to the Atlantic Ocean. Main grape variety used for Left Bank wines is cabernet sauvignon. Famous communes on the Left Bank are Margaux, St.-Julien, Pauillac, St.-Estèphe, Graves, and Sauternes.\n    Liqueur d'Expédition:\n        Definition: The wine added to the Champagne bottle after DISGORGING to top it up. The liqueur d’expédition is often made up of wines reserved from previous years and it contains some sweetness (known as the DOSAGE).\n    Liqueur de Tirage:\n        Definition: The mixture of wine and sugar added along with YEASTS to the blend of still wines in a Champagne bottle in order to induce the second, bubble-forming fermentation.\n\nM:\n    Macération Carbonique:\n        Definition: CARBONIC MACERATION, a type of FERMENTATION where uncrushed grapes are placed whole into vats that are then closed. As the weight of the grapes on top crushes grapes on the bottom, juice is released and fermentation begins. This in turn releases the gas CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), which causes other grapes to ferment, effectively, within their skins. Commonly used to ferment fruity red wines for early drinking, typically in Beaujolais and sometimes in the Loire.\n    Marc:\n        Definition: The French term for an EAU-DE-VIE made specifically by distilling the POMACE (grape skins, stems, and seeds) leftover after pressing, not by distilling wine. Marc is generally a slightly more powerfully flavored spirit than eau-de-vie.\n    Mas:\n        Definition: The southern French term for a DOMAINE, sometimes translated as “farm.”\n    Méthode Champenoise:\n        Definition: The labor-intensive method used to make Champagne and other fine SPARKLING WINES. In this method, the wine undergoes a SECONDARY FERMENTATION, which creates the bubbles, in its individual bottle rather than in one large cask or vat.\n    Millerandage:\n        Definition: A viticultural problem caused by abnormal pollination and fruit set. It results in differently sized berries with different numbers of seeds within one bunch. The yield of the crop is reduced, although the berries are highly aromatic.\n```\nThis content covers various entries from a glossary or dictionary related to wine and viticulture, each defined clearly and concisely."

The section \"3.1 L’analyse sensorielle\" translates to \"3.1 Sensory Analysis.\" Below is a structured representation of the content, divided into key segments:\n\n---\n\n## 3.1 Sensory Analysis\n\n### L'analyse gustative\nThe analysis of wine in the mouth is done by determining its attack, balance, and length.\n\n- **L’attaque (Attack):** The first sensation after ingesting wine, which is always soft (mellow). The attack is carried by alcohols (ethanol, glycerol) and by sugars (glucose and fructose) in the case of sweet wines. This sensation can be short or long, and its softness is relative; if acidic or astringent flavors predominate, they gradually take over. The assessment of the attack's length is, therefore, relative.\n\n- **L’équilibre (Balance):** Determined mainly by the power and especially by the ratio of different components in a wine:\n  - Sweet (sugary), acid, and alcohol for white wines.\n  - Sweet, acid, tannins, and alcohol for red wines.\n  \n  The balance depends on the harmony of the wine's constitution.\n\n- **L’évolution (Evolution):** During the tasting of wine, successive impressions (bouts) are felt. Often the last impressions (bitter final) differ from the initial impressions (soft attack). The analysis of how the wine evolves in the mouth (attack -> evolution -> end of mouth/bouquet) reflects the wine's qualities.\n\n- **La longueur (Length):** An intense aromatic persistence (PIA) is the time in seconds (or caudalies) during which the aroma persists in the mouth after the wine has been swallowed or spit out. When the least volatile constituents (less pungent smells) are no longer perceivable, there is a resurgence of salivation. A long length in wine is more interesting to pair with appropriately matched dishes as it creates a more important space for the superposition of flavors and aromas. Length in mouth should not be confused with an aftertaste, which is a different flavor from tasting.\n\n### Visually Represented Concepts:\n\n- Diagrams illustrating \"L'examen gustatif = l'analyse\" (The gustative examination = analysis) and \"Equilibre dans les vins blancs\" (Balance in white wines) and \"Equilibre dans les vins rouges\" (Balance in red wines), showing different sensory aspects of wine tasting.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed breakdown captures the key points of sensory analysis in wine tasting as explained in the document."

Below is the structured content as presented in the text:\n\n---\n\n### Sangiovese\n\n- **Flavor and Structure**: Closer to pinot noir than to cabernet sauvignon. Sangiovese's structure primarily derives from acidity rather than tannin.\n- **Taste and Sensations**: At its youthful stage, Sangiovese offers appealing flavors reminiscent of a warm cherry pie. It also provides layered tastes of dried leaf, dried orange peel, tea, mocha, spicy, peaty, earthy flavors, and a distinct sensation of minerality, even saltness. Notably, it contains less sodium.\n- **Historical Importance**: Sangiovese, native to Tuscany, pairs well with Tuscan dietary staples like peppery extra virgin olive oil.\n- **Additional Notes**: It improves its taste when in Tuscany, potentially influenced by local culinary habits.\n\n### Sauvignon Blanc\n\n- **Origin of Name**: The name “sauvignon” is derived from the French word “sauvage,” meaning \"wild\".\n- **Characteristics**: It exhibits a riotous, untamed, and wild character if left to its own devices.\n- **Flavors Profile**: This wine variety presents a mix of straw, hay, grass, smoke, green tea, green herbs, lime, and gunflint, delivering a rich intensity.\n- **Taste Description**: It offers a linear taste on the palate complemented by a sharp acidity that feels like a keen stiletto.\n- **Unique Aspects**: Some Sauvignon Blanc varieties develop a feral, acrid character, often likened to the smell of cat pee, which surprisingly is considered a positive attribute in wine circles.\n\n---\n\nEach section highlights specific aspects of the wine's profile, offering insights into their unique characteristics and sensory experiences."

Here's the structured content of the document:\n\n---\n\n### Seasonality\n\n**It is almost a cliché to talk about seasonality if you are a New American chef. You are cooking that way naturally. I had a customer complain that his favorite pea ravioli was not on the menu. I explained that peas were not very good at the time, so that we were featuring corn ravioli. I don’t focus on making an ingredient that is not at its peak taste better; I simply take it off the menu. Chefs still pay more attention to seasonality than customers do. We still have diners who want berries in the middle of February!**\n— **Andrew Carmellini, A Voce (New York City)**\n\n**Cooking with ingredients at their seasonal peak is such a central tenet of good cooking that it bears constant repeating. In stores across the country, you can find almost any ingredient at almost any time of year. However, an ingredient’s mere availability offers no assurances of its quality.**\n\n**Each season suggests a different palette of ingredients, and different ways of preparing and serving them. Classic holiday dishes represent time-tested ways of celebrating the season: Picture a grilled hamburger followed by a red, white, and blue strawberry shortcake accented with blueberries and whipped cream served on the Fourth of July, or roasted turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. (If you’re not convinced of the perfection of each dish’s expression of the season and occasion, just imagine eating each menu on the other holiday!) Each season also suggests its own beverages; for example, summer calls more often for lighter-bodied white and rosé wines, just as winter calls for fuller-bodied reds.**\n\n--- \n\nThis document emphasizes the importance of using ingredients during their peak seasons for optimal flavor and quality, an approach typical for chefs specializing in New American cuisine who prioritize freshness and seasonality in their dishes. It includes a quote from Andrew Carmellini, a chef in New York City, highlighting practical examples of seasonal adjustments in menu offerings."

    "contenu": "# PAIRING WHEN DINING OUT\n\nDealing with the wine and food dynamic in restaurants can be trickier than at home, as things are not completely under your control. As a grizzled veteran of the hospitality world, I have definite opinions on how to maximize pleasure for restaurant guests. And, of course, I've also eaten my fair share of restaurant meals and gleaned additional information from the diner’s perspective. Many people may be perfectly content to let others, in this case the team of a restaurant, do all the heavy lifting and simply enjoy the results. Some people, however, especially very serious wine lovers, tremble when the details are left to others and take comfort if they can help steer the service. Either way, the following should help.\n\n## Decide the priority.\nIf there are specific dishes you want to order, a chef’s special you are aching to try, or a dish that comes with a marvelous description from the waiter, realize that the food has taken priority. Then choose your wine(s) carefully around the dishes. If you have a savvy sommelier or are going to one of those wine-shine restaurants, you may prefer to select your wines and work from there. Above all, don’t close your eyes and point. And don’t hesitate to ask for help in choosing either the wine or the food. After all, the staff works there and should know their wares!\n\n## Ask if the restaurant is known for specific dishes.\nIf it is, and the choices suit your fancy, go with those, and then select your wines accordingly.\n\n## If you bring your own wines, help to ensure they are handled properly.\nWhere this practice is legal (it varies by state), this means bringing the wines to the restaurant at the correct temperature, stood up if they are older reds. Tell the server anything about the wine that he or she may need to know. If it feels right, share a taste with your waiter or sommelier; you may save yourself a corkage fee, make a new friend, and become privy to insider information—for instance, about special wines that don’t appear on the wine list.\n\n## Set things up the way you’d like.\nIf you have ordered multiple wines or want wines served in a specific order or at a specific time, ask your server to accommodate you. For example, do multiple wines need different glasses? Will certain wines need to be decanted or opened ahead of time?"
