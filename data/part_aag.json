This process is common not only for cod liver oil but also for other types of fish liver oils, including those from shark and skate. David Wetzel, a researcher from Nebraska, has explored both historical and modern methods of extracting cod liver oil.\n\n### Modern Industrial Processes\nThe contemporary industrial techniques for extracting cod liver oil that Wetzel studied involve several complex steps:\n- **Alkali Refining**\n- **Bleaching**\n- **Winterization**\n- **Deodorization**\n\nThese processes, particularly **deodorization**, are known to remove some of the beneficial fat-soluble vitamins found in the oil, which can impact its nutritional value.\n\n### Traditional Methods\nAn 1895 article on \"Cod-Liver Oil and Chemistry\" by F. Peckel Møller outlines a more primitive method:\n1. **Collection**: Fishermen collect the cod livers daily after selling their catch.\n2. **Storage**: The livers are stored in barrels without removing the gall-bladder.\n3. **Processing**: Each day's catch is added to the barrels, which are topped up regularly throughout the fishing season until the barrels are full.\n4. **Fermentation**: The oils naturally ferment in the barrel, resulting in the liver cells bursting and releasing the oil. This oil floats to the top, from where it is later collected.\n\nBy the end of the fishing season, the oil that has risen to the top is termed raw medicinal oil. This oil is typically of a light yellow color and needs to be drawn off before the livers undergo further putrefaction. Most of this oil, however, is of such quality that, while medicinal, may still require further refining due to the significant quantity of liver left to further decompose.\n\nThe article notes that these traditional methods, when compared to modern industrial practices, often retain more of the natural qualities and potentially beneficial nutrients of the oil, albeit at the cost of involving less precise, more variable processes."

    "contenu": "The document provided discusses the topic of aroma molecules, particularly how they interact to affect the perception of scents. It is structured into two main sections, text explanations followed by supporting graphs. Here's the detailed structured content along with a summarization:\n\n### Adding other aromas\nThe section titled \"Adding other aromas\" explains that perceiving an aroma molecule does not strictly depend on it being above the odour threshold; similar structural or perceived molecules can interact to create a synergy or additivity. Examples include ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate whose mixture has a lower odour threshold collectively than separately. The section further discusses how such combinations can produce a new scent that is more intense than its individual components, such as in the case of Blue cheese which owes its distinctive odour to this phenomenon. It mentions specific aroma interactions in products like Chanel No. 5, where adding fatty aldehydes increases floral notes but its effectiveness is concentration dependent.\n\n### Interactions between aroma molecules\n\n#### 1. Synergy\n- **Definition:** Describes the effect when the impact of similar odorants when mixed produces a new scent that seems more intense than its individual components.\n- **Graph description (Synergy graph):** Shows how the combined response of molecules 1 and 2 grows significantly with increasing concentration, representing a more intense perceived fragrance than either molecule alone.\n\n#### 2. Inhibition\n- **Definition:** Occurs when complex scent molecule interactions offset the ability of receptors to detect scents, resulting in a diminished sensory response.\n- **Graph description (Inhibition graph):** Illustrates that the presence of molecule 2 reduces the perceived response to molecule 1 as the concentration increases, therefore molecule 1 and 2 combined create a lesser scent intensity compared to each molecule separately at higher concentrations.\n\n#### 3. Suppression\n- **Definition:** When the mixture is less intense than the strongest molecule alone, but the mixture's highest intensity molecule is still perceived more intensely than other molecules in the blend.\n- **Graph description (Suppression graph):** Exhibits how a mixture can make the combined fragrance less perceptible when compared to the individual response of the most prominent molecule even at the same concentration.\n\n#### 4. Overshadowing\n- **Definition:** Occurs when a mixture’s intensity equals one of its component molecules but is still overshadowed by this single component.\n- **Graph description (Overshadowing graph):** Demonstrates that even if a mixture has a similar response level to one of its constituents, the impact of that single constituent still dominates the overall aroma perception.\n\nThis analysis clarifies how aroma molecules interact in complex ways influencing the fragrance of products, which is essential in fields like perfumery, food flavoring, etc."

Faites tremper les haricots à la veille. Cuisiez-les comme indiqué p. 82 en ajoutant à l’eau de cuisson 1'oignon piqué des clous de girofle, le thym et le laurier. Laissez cuire 1 h 30, puis égouttez-les.\n2. Pelez les carottes, les pommes de terre et le potiron. Coupez-les en morceaux de taille égale. Pelez et hachez l'oignon. Coupez le céleri en lamelles. Lavez soigneusement et émincez l'ard. Lavez le chou noir, tenez ses côtes épaisses si nécessaire et émincez-le grossièrement. Équeutez les haricots verts. Coupez-les en petits tronçons.\n3. Faites chauffer l'huile dans une cocotte. Faites-y revenir l'oignon et le céleri. Ajoutez le potiron ou la courgette, les carottes, les pommes de terre, le chou noir, l’eau et le bouquet garni. Ajoutez la croûte du parmesan coupée en morceaux. Portez à ébullition, couvrez et laissez mijoter 20 minutes. Mélangez en écrasant les pommes de terre.\n4. Ajoutez les haricots verts, les épinards, les pâtes et les haricots blancs cuits. Portez de nouveau à ébullition et laissez cuire à 10 minutes.\n5. Goûtez, rectifiez l’assaisonnement, ôtez la croûte du parmesan. Servez avec le parmesan râpé et un filet d’huile d’olive.\n   \n#### Le conseil du chef\nPour une version express, n’hésitez pas à utiliser des conserves de haricots blancs déjà cuits. Incorporez-les également aux potées: les commande-récoltes. Comme toutes les soupes à base de légumineuses, c'est encore meilleur le lendemain, réchauffé à feu doux et servi sur de grandes tranches de pain de campagne grillé.\n\n#### Bon à savoir\nAu nord de l'Italie, le minestrone (littéralement « grosse soupe ») a autant de variantes que de régions ! Le chou noir en feuilles est typique de Toscane, où la ribollita est un style de minestrone à lui tout seul. À Gênes, on y met du pesto, en Lombardie et au Piémont, on gylisse de l’arborio, riz rond utilisé pour le risotto. Allieurs, on y met plutôt des pâtes ditalini. Certains glissent du porc, d'autres pas du tout : tout était question de période de l’année et de production locale. Quand à la croûte du parmesan, c’est là où se concentrent le plus ses saveurs : elle contribue à épaissir le bouillon et lui donne un goût unique.\n\n### Rérenvois techniques\n- Cuire des légumineuses, p. 82\n- Préparer de blettes, p. 15\n- Préparer un bouquet garni, p. 30"

Below is the structured content of the document:\n\n### Building Your Aroma Library\n\n#### Introduction to Aroma Perception\n- **Human Perception of Smell**: Unlike tactile or taste senses, smell perception is influenced heavily by previous experiences. Rarely do humans perceive solitary aroma molecules; more commonly, they encounter a blend of various odors.\n- **Complexity in Identification**: Humans generally find it easier to distinguish mixtures of volatile compounds rather than individual aromatic molecules. Even trained experts struggle with identifying solo aroma contributors within complex mixtures.\n\n#### Importance of Olfactory Diversity\n- **Nuanced Perception**: The human olfactory system blends multiple odorants, sometimes over twenty in a single scenario, causing less distinctiveness unless meticulously trained.\n- **Generic Smells**: Many everyday smells come from similar combinations of odorants, causing them to smell analogous despite minor variations.\n\n#### Expanding Your Frame of Reference\n- **Experiential Learning**: The document highlights the importance of building personal ‘aroma libraries’ through varied experiences, which aids in enhancing sensory appreciation in settings like wine tasting or coffee sampling.\n- **Familiar vs. Novel Odors**: Familiarity plays a crucial role in odor recognition and appreciation. Unusual or complex odors that are unfamiliar can often be overlooked or misunderstood without proper olfactory training.\n\n#### Enhancing Aroma Recognition Skills\n- **Building Aroma Libraries**: Regularly engaging with diverse foods and beverages and attempting to identify less noticeable or complex odors can broaden one’s olfactory repertoire.\n- **Wide Variances in Recognition**: The ability to pinpoint specific odorants out of hundreds possible improves with exposure and deliberate practice.\n\n#### Summary Box: An Exercise in Recognizing Aromas\n- **Practical Steps for Expanding Aroma Library**: Actively smell varied ingredients and products. Begin by identifying obvious smells like spices and herbs, then progress to discerning subtle differences, such as between cinnamon and cloves or nutmeg and allspice. This cultivates an ability to distinguish and appreciate subtle differences in complex aromas.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- **Continuous Learning**: The process of building and refining an aroma library is ongoing, necessitating a proactive approach towards engaging and learning from everyday olfactory experiences.\n\nThis structured approach to understanding the document provides a clear framework for anyone interested in elevating their ability to recognize and appreciate the complex world of aromas."

This practice was later adopted by the Aztecs and Mayans.\n- The fermentation process transformed the dried and roasted beans, which were ground into a dark paste and mixed with water, maize, chili peppers, vanilla, achiote to add red coloring, and other herbs and spices, resulting in a frothy, flavored beverage.\n- In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors brought chocolate from the Americas to the Old World, incorporating sugar, honey, and other sweeteners, which increased its popularity.\n- Solid chocolate was first produced by British chocolate makers J. S. Fry & Sons in the mid-19th century.\n- Dark chocolate typically contains as much as 90 percent cocoa, with variations like milk chocolate and white chocolate offering different sensory experiences.\n\n### From Cacao Bean to Chocolate Bar:\n- The process of making chocolate involves multiple highly detailed steps, influencing the complex flavors and aromas of the final product.\n- Three main varieties of cacao beans (Criollo, Forastero, and Trinitario) each have distinct characteristics noticeable post-processing.\n- Factors like origin, environmental conditions, fermentation processes, and even the proximity to neighboring farms affect the flavor profile.\n- For example, Peruvian dark chocolate from Costa Rica is noted for being more fruity and floral, while cocoa beans from particular regions in Ghana are described as more nutty.\n- The text highlights that raw cacao beans undergo several changes during production including drying which leads to nutty and spice notes while poorly dried or stored cacao can lead to unpleasant flavors.\n- The process of conching, where roasted beans are mixed with cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and other ingredients, and heated while being stirred, refines chocolate's texture and reduces acidity.\n\n### Specialty and Nuances:\n- The intricate balance and blending of ingredients during chocolate making create variations like white chocolate, noted for lacking cocoa powder but including deodorized cocoa butter for a more complex taste.\n- White chocolate variations might include subtle touches like orange, mushroom, floral, or earthy notes."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n### Glossary\n\n#### Passito\nA style of Italian wine made from intentionally desiccated grapes. Amarone is a well-known example of a passito-styled wine.\n\n#### Pétillant\nA term used to describe a sparkling wine with a light effervescence. Pétillant wines prickle the palate very gently.\n\n#### Qualitätswein mit Prädikat\nA term from the German wine law, literally meaning “quality wines with attributes.” The terms for these attributes, used to designate different categories of wines, represent increasing levels of ripeness: Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese (BA), Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA), and Eiswein.\n\n#### Recioto\nAn Italian term that originally referred to the “ears,” or the fattest and ripest clusters of grapes on a bunch. Today the term has come to mean a selection of high-quality fruit that has been made into passito wines that are usually, though not always, sweet.\n\n#### Reserve\nA term frequently understood to imply high quality but which, in the United States, has no legal meaning. At its best, it refers to wines that are produced from the finest lots and the best vineyards and treated with extra care, resulting in superb wines. At its worst, it’s exploited by disingenuous wineries that prey on the consumer’s belief that reserve must mean better. The European terms reserva (Spanish) and riserva (Italian) are, however, legally binding and have to do with aging requirements in the barrel and bottle.\n\n#### Residual sugar\nThe amount of sugar that is left in a wine after alcoholic fermentation.\n\n#### Selection\nA cutting from an existing vine selected for propagation in new vineyards to produce fruit with the desired characteristics of the original vine. The term selection is often used interchangeably with clone (see above), but they are not synonymous.\n\n#### Semi-sweet\nSee Off-dry.\n\n#### Skin contact\nThe process of fermenting grapes with their skins. In red wines this step is critical, as all of the flavor, color, and tannins are in the skins. The juice may also be left in contact with the skins either before or after alcoholic fermentation.\n\n#### Soft\nA term suggesting an approachable wine. In the positive sense, soft suggests a gentle elegance that can match splendidly with food. In the negative sense, it implies that the wine is lacking in character and apt to be easily dominated by a dish.\n\n#### Spiciness\nThe suggestion of spice aromas in a wine. They can be inherent to the grape type (as pepper is to Mourvèdre and cardamom to Gewürztraminer), but more often they come from extended oak aging. Sweet spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and vanilla) are easily detected in many oak-aged wines.\n\n#### Spumante\nThe Italian word for “sparkling.”\n\n#### Structure\nThe overall sense of weight and texture in a wine; a direct function of the levels of alcohol, tannin, acidity, and other essential characteristics.\n\n#### Sweetness\nThe amount of sugar perceived in a wine. Sweetness can range from nonexistent or imperceptible (in dry wines) to slightly sweet (in off-dry or semi-sweet wines) to very sweet (in dessert wines).\n\n#### Tannins\nNaturally occurring, bitter-tasting and astringently acidic compounds in wine that are extracted from the skins, stems, and seeds of the grapes. Although tannins are most often associated with red wines, which are fermented with their skins, white wines also can be tannic if fermented in contact with the grape skins. Wines that spend time in oak may also pick up tannins from the barrels. Tannins enable red wines to age well and must be taken into account in wine and food matching."

Here is an analysis based on the structured segments of the document:\n\n---\n\n### Creating Pairings that Work - Page 13\n\n#### 1. Sweetness as a Balance to Spiciness\n- **Sweetness in food and wine**: Highlights that sweetness in wine helps counterbalance the spicy heat in food, such as Malaysian curry or Chinese hot-and-spicy chicken, making it an excellent foil to tame the spiciness.\n\n#### 2. Sweetness Complements Food\n- **Example pairing**: An off-dry Chenin Blanc with grouper and mango salsa.\n- **Sweet wines**: Works well with dishes that include sweet fruits or sauces, enhancing the flavors when paired with off-dry wines.\n\n#### 3. Sweetness Contrasts with Salt\n- **Specific pairings mentioned**:\n  - Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups with Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream.\n- **Juxtaposed Flavors**: Discusses how chocolates and salty snacks can be balanced with sweet wines like French Sauternes or rich cheeses.\n\n#### 4. Sweetness Versus Tartness\n- **Balancing tart foods**: Wines that are moderately sweet can soften the tartness of certain foods, improving the overall dish's balance.\n- **Cuisine examples**: Asian appetizers with sweet and tart profiles pair well with off-dry wines.\n\n#### 5. Very Sweet Wines with Desserts\n- **Key rule**: Dessert wines should be sweeter than the actual dessert to maintain flavor balance.\n- **Wedding cake example**: A sweeter sparkling wine is recommended over less sweet options to accompany rich, sweet desserts like cake with buttercream frosting.\n\n#### 6. Tannin in Wine\n- **Effect of tannin**: Associated with a bitter and gritty texture, similar to over-steeped black tea.\n- **Advice**: Pairing tannic wines carefully, considering the texture and flavor intensity of the food to avoid overwhelming bitterness or astringency.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "The document presents a detailed description of how to create plant-based milk and cheese substitutes from seeds and nuts. Below is a structured outline of the content covered in the document:\n\n1. **Introduction to Seed and Nut Milks:**\n   - Seeds and nuts can be extracted into milk form. Examples include hemp seed milk and almond milk.\n\n2. **Making Almond Milk:**\n   - Blanch almonds in boiling water for a minute.\n   - Rinse with cool water to easily remove the skins, which can be bitter.\n   - Experiment with different seeds, nuts, and proportions.\n\n3. **Fermentation of Nut and Seed Milks:**\n   - Nut and seed milks can be fermented to resemble mammalian milk but will not be identical.\n   - Soy milk can be fermented using yogurt cultures, and other nut or seed milks can spontaneously ferment or be cultured with various starters such as dairy starters, sauerkraut juice, or water kefir.\n\n4. **Seed and Nut Cheese Preparation:**\n   - Seed and nut pulp leftover from milk production can be used to make cheese.\n   - The cheese is thick, moldable, and spreadable.\n   - Preparation involves soaking seeds or nuts, grinding them with a little water, adding a live-culture starter and herbs, and adjusting water for consistency.\n   - The mixture should be aged for a day or two, stirred periodically, and hung in cheesecloth to thicken.\n\n5. **Personal Experience and Recommendation:**\n   - The author finds seed and nut-based cheese more enticing than their milk counterparts.\n   - The best non-dairy \"cheese\" mentioned is \"Keckek el Fouqara.\"\n\nThis document outlines an alternative approach for producing non-dairy milk and cheese products emphasizing experimentation and personal adaptation in the processes."

    "contenu": "### Document Analysis: Cooking Ingredients and Recommendations\n\n#### Section: Skordalia with Pommes de Terre & Tomato\n- **Ingredients**: Potatoes, tomatoes; can be enhanced with skordalia.\n- **Serving Suggestion**: Serve with hot potatoes, preferably sautéed.\n- **Taste Notes**: Skordalia adds a spice due to its garlic content, enhancing the flavor of dishes. Capers on their own or infused saffron and thyme offer distinct flavors.\n  \n#### Main Content: Raifort (Horseradish)\n- **Characteristics**: Horseradish is sharp and releases piquant compounds that may cause tears or stinging in the nose.\n- **Flavors**: Aligns well with smoky flavors like smoked fish, fragrant herbs, and strong tastes like tomatoes or alcohol-infused dishes. It has a capacity similar to mustard to clear the palate when combined with richer dishes.\n- **Pairing Suggestions**:\n  - **With Potatoes and Beets**: Mix grated horseradish and beets with proportions of 6:1. Dress with salt, pepper, sugar, and citrusy sour cream sauce. Can be used as a filling or in bortsch.\n  - **With Beef**: Enhances the flavor of smoked beef.\n  - **With Celery**: Often combined with celery in dishes.\n  - **With Oysters**: Especially in New Orleans, often served with horseradish or in a mix with ketchup; known to enhance flavors and provide a tingling sensation.\n  - **With Pork Fat (Lard)**: Often combined with smoked lard in dishes providing contrasting flavors. Recommended to try at least once.\n  - **With Peas**: Also can be an excellent complement to peas.\n\n#### Additional Preparatory Notes:\n- **Horseradish in Dishes**: Enhances and complements the earthy tones of potatoes and beets, and adds a fresh zing to seafood dishes.\n- **Preparation Tips**: It is advised to handle horseradish with caution and gratitude towards its natural robust flavors.\n\nThe document seems to focus on various culinary uses and benefits of horseradish, pairing it with other ingredients to elevate the flavors in cooking. It also mentions how these combinations play with the senses, particularly with respect to smell and taste."
