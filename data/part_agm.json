It also mentions a shift in the usage of sherry in cocktails post-2008, credited to insights from the Sherry Council of America and advocates like Steve Olson and Andy Seymour. This led to experimentation with sherry in cocktails, appreciating its oxidized-wine character alongside flavors such as dried fruit, honey, and nuts. Specific drier styles, such as amontillado and oloroso, are highlighted for their suitability in cocktails like the Coffey Park Swizzle and its variations including the Dolores Park Swizzle and La Viña.

It is structured into several key sections:\n\n1. **Taste and Aroma of Citrus Fruits:** \n   - Citrus fruits' flavor is created by citric acid, sugars, and phenolic compounds found in the albedo and peel.\n   - Citrus fruits are rich in amino acid glutamate, contain little starch, and have more acid towards the blossom end.\n   - Citrus aroma comes from oil glands in the skin and two sources in the juice vesicles, which contain fruit esters and aromatic compounds.\n\n2. **Citrus Peel:**\n   - Citrus peel is used to flavor dishes and for candied preparation owing to its intensely flavored oils and protective phenolic substances.\n   - The preparation involves softening, leaching, and infusing the peel with a sugar syrup to extract valuable phytochemicals.\n\n3. **Processing of Citrus Fruits:**\n   - In making marmalade and similar processed foods, the skin is removed by immersing the fruit in hot water to soften the cell wall and start enzyme activity that helps in peeling.\n   - The water-insoluble oils remain in the rind, which is a key ingredient in marmalade, providing bitterness that balances sugar.\n\n4. **Types of Citrus Fruits:**\n   - The section introduces specific citrus fruits, their origins, hybridization, and unique characteristics:\n       - **Citrus medica** (citron): Originated from the Middle East, known for its intensely aromatic rind used in various cultural and religious practices.\n       - **Citrus reticulata** (mandarin) and **Citrus grandis** (pomelo hybrid resulting in grapefruit): These are mentioned for their hybrids and distinctive characteristics.\n\nThe excerpt is highly informative, focusing on the science behind the taste, processing, and various types of citrus fruits, highlighting their cultural and culinary significance. It seems to be extracted from a detailed study or comprehensive book on the subject."

    "contenu": "The document contains structured information on two wine grapes: Syrah and Tempranillo, highlighting their characteristics, historical significance, and wine style variations.\n\n---\n\n### Syrah\n\nSyrah was first introduced to California in 1936 and experienced renewed interest in the 1970s. It became popular in both California and Washington State during the 1980s. Although widely cultivated and known either as Syrah or Shiraz, no single appellation has emerged as the definitive area for these grapes. From a wine production standpoint, knowing whether the wine is marketed as Syrah or Shiraz can affect how it is received by consumers.\n\nSyrah's genetic background is linked to two lesser-known French grapes: dureza (from Ardèche) and mondeuse blanche (from Savoie). It is suggested that dureza makes Syrah a distant relative of pinot noir.\n\n### Tempranillo\n\nTempranillo, Spain's renowned red grape, is predominantly cultivated in the Rioja region but is found across the country. It shows different styles largely influenced by its growing location. A typical Rioja Tempranillo features the fineness and earthy tones reminiscent of a Burgundy red (pinot noir), while variants from regions such as Toro and Ribera del Duero show denser and more robust characteristics.\n\nTempranillo's adaptation over time has led to the emergence of different clones, which may present as distinct varieties but are essentially the same grape. Common local names for Tempranillo include ull de llebre, cencibel, tinto aragonéz, and escobera.\n\nKey characteristics of Tempranillo include a cherry flavor in its youth, transitioning to a deeper, more complex earthiness upon aging. It is well-structured and balanced, suitable for long aging periods but differs from cabernet sauvignon in its tannin structure and is less acidic compared to pinot noir.\n\n### Genetic Lineage\n\nTempranillo might be partially descended from albillo mayor, a grape native to Ribera del Duero. It's thought to have originated from the provinces of Rioja and Navarra in northern Spain.\n\n---\n\nThe document provides insights into the origins, evolution, and characteristics of both the Syrah and Tempranillo grape varieties, highlighting their significance in the wine industry."

    "contenu": "The content provided from the document primarily discusses \"Vintner Choices\" in the production of red wine, particularly focusing on the Cabernet Sauvignon variety. Here is the structured content breakdown:\n\n### VINTNER CHOICES\n\n**Key Aspects of Wine Production:**\n- **Fermentation temperature**\n- **Length of post-fermentation maceration**\n- **Use of wood:** Choices between wood or no wood; type, size, and age of wood; stainless-steel or barrel fermentation.\n- **Varietal composition:** 100 percent varietal or blended.\n- **Tannin management**\n- **Micro-oxygenation**\n- **Selection of clones**\n\n**General Observations:**\n- Consistent production methods across grape varieties.\n- Importance of skins in color, flavor, and tannins extraction.\n- Wine characteristics affected by fermentation temperatures and maceration times (typically varies but most vintners choose about one to three weeks).\n\n**Influence of Geographical Region and Grape Quality:**\n- Wine prices vary from affordable everyday drinking wines to expensive top-tier versions.\n- Wines are aged using different types of wood, affecting the flavor attributes. For example, $700 French oak barrels can significantly enhance the flavor.\n\n**Wine Aging Considerations:**\n- Small barrels increase surface area for more wood and wine interaction, enhancing flavor.\n- Other methods include using wood staves or \"tea bagging\" oak chips.\n- Each technique impacts the integrated flavors within the wine differently.\n\n**Varietal Blending and Labeling:**\n- Cabernet can be pure or blended with other varietal grapes like Merlot and Cabernet Franc.\n- Blends result in different styles and can soften the dominant character of Cabernet Sauvignon.\n- In the U.S., wines labeled as Cabernet must contain at least 75 percent Cabernet fruit.\n\nThis section offers insights into the nuanced decisions involved in vintner strategies and the regulatory aspects shaping Cabernet Sauvignon wine production. Additionally, it notes that details on principal wine-growing regions for Cabernet Sauvignon are available on another part of the document (pages 275-77)."

Delicate, lightly sweet, and gorgeously fruity, moscato d’Asti is particularly low in alcohol—no more than 5.5 percent by law (Asti is usually 7 to 9 percent alcohol). This makes moscato d’Asti a fairly fragile wine, which in turn has made it highly desirable among Italian wine connoisseurs.\n\nMoscato d’Asti is also less effervescent than Asti. It is not considered spumante (foaming) at all, just a bit frizzante (fizzy). Since it is under less pressure than Asti, it is stoppered with a regular cork, not a sparkling wine cork with a wire cage. Moscato d’Asti is vintage dated and is served well chilled, generally in regular wineglasses, not flutes. It should be drunk while fresh, soon after release. In Piedmont it’s traditional to drink a glass on Christmas morning.\n\n#### SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCERS OF MOSCATO D'ASTI\n\n- Cascina La Spinetta-Rivetti\n- Icardi\n- I Vignaioli di Santo Stefano\n- Marchesi di Gresy\n- Vietti Cascinetta"

It discusses how countries where it is legal to purchase and consume alcohol handle the legislation for wine, focusing on safety, labeling, and authenticity, particularly concerning geographical indications.\n\n### Wine and the Law\n**Main Issues Addressed by Legislation:**\n1. **Safety**: Ensuring the wine is safe for human consumption by regulating harmful substances and processing agents like sulphur dioxide (SO2).\n2. **Labeling**: Ensuring that information on the wine label is accurate and reflective of the product inside, including the description, origin, and potentially harmful substances.\n3. **Authenticity/Geographical Indication**: Protects the origin and authenticity of wines, particularly regarding specific geographic regions or locales to mitigate fraud and protect regional heritage.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n#### 1. Food Safety\n- **Concern**: Ensuring wine is safe for consumption, focusing on trace chemicals such as SO2.\n- **SO2 Use**: Naturally found in wines and added to prevent oxidation and spoilage. Legal limitations and requirements for its declaration on labels due to potential health risks.\n  \n#### 2. Label Integrity\n- **Responsibility**: It lies on the producer or seller to ensure the label truthfully represents the product.\n- **Key Labeling Requirements to Check**:\n  - Accuracy of product description.\n  - Clear statement of any harmful agents used (e.g., SO2).\n  - Origin of the wine must be verified and accurately represented.\n\n#### 3. Geographical Indications\n- **Definition**: \"GIs\" refer to the specific regions which have a notable influence on the characteristics of the wine.\n- **Importance**: GIs help to ensure that wines are genuinely from the regions claimed, often encompassing specific vineyards or broader regions (e.g., Bordeaux, Burgundy).\n- **Control and Fraud Prevention**: Strict regulations ensure wines labeled with a GI are indeed from those places, protecting the reputation of the region and preventing fraud.\n\n#### 4. International and Regional Differences\n- **World Trade Organization (WTO)**: Developed a system for GIs recognized globally, allowing uniformity and respect among wine-producing countries.\n- **European Union (EU)**: Classification of wines into PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication). PDOs have stricter guidelines and are limited to specific areas. PGIs cover larger areas and have fewer restrictions. EU labeling often excludes the term PDO or PGI, using local terms like \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) in France.\n\n### Summary\nThe document highlights the importance of wine legislation that ensures safety, accurate labeling, and authentication through the use of geographical indications, thereby protecting consumers and regions' wine legacies. Although it discusses global practices, it also notes specific adaptations and practices for regions like the EU and references broader global agreements like those from the WTO."

However, with the aid of an emulsifier, these two can form a stable, thick liquid called an emulsion.\n- Emulsifiers (e.g., proteins, egg yolk, certain hybrid molecules) stabilize these mixtures by being soluble in both water and oil, breaking the oil into microscopic droplets and preventing them from coalescing.\n\n**Foams: Thickening with Bubbles**\n- It explains that foams are created by dispersing air into a fluid, which creates resistance similar to that provided by solid particles.\n- The example given includes whipped cream and meringue, where air bubbles introduced into the liquid add structure and volume.\n\nThe page is illustrated with diagrams of oil droplets and air bubbles representing an emulsion and foam respectively, underscoring how these elements physically interact within the mixture to disrupt the flow and increase viscosity.\n\nThe emphasis is placed on the capacity of these physical interactions to interfere with the fluid's normal flow, making them thicker and structurally different from their original liquid forms."

    "contenu": "**HOW WINE IS MADE**\n\nWine has been with us for more than six thousand years. Yet the natural, complex process by which it is made—fermentation—has been understood for only a little more than 160 years. It was not until the 1850s, when Louis Pasteur’s research in microbiology linked sugar’s conversion to alcohol (fermentation) to the living organisms called yeasts, that winemaking moved out of the realm of the occult and into the realm of science. More than a century more would pass before the next significant advances in wine-making occurred.\n\nUp until World War II, most wines were made according to two classic methods, one for white wine, the other for red. The only exceptions were fortified wines, such as Sherry and Port, and sparkling wines, such as Champagne—all of which were made in specialized, complex ways of their own. By the 1960s, advances in winemaking around the world, plus the advent of more sophisticated winemaking equipment—especially temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks—meant that winemakers possessed a far greater ability to influence a wine’s aromas, flavors, texture, and finish. A powerful new world of winemaking was born. In this chapter we look at how mere grape juice becomes the stuff of poetry and legend."

These molecules are typically formed by one or a few specific kinds of sugars and are categorized based on their overall characteristics such as size range, average composition, and common properties. Polysaccharides like sugars contain many exposed oxygen and hydrogen atoms allowing them to form hydrogen bonds and absorb water; however, their solubility in water can vary.\n\n---\n\n**Starch**\n- **Importance:** Starch is considered the most significant type of polysaccharide. It works as a compact and unreactive polymer where plants store sugar.\n- **Structure:** Composed of glucose units, it exists in two forms:\n  - **Amylose:** A straight, linear chain.\n  - **Amylopectin:** A highly branched form.\n- **Properties:** Starch molecules are organized in layers to form compact granules. Upon heating (e.g., cooking), these granules swell by absorbing water, and when cooled, the starch molecules can reassociate to form a solid gel.\n- **Utility:** The behavior of starch during cooking impacts the texture of various food items such as cooked rice, noodles, breads, pastries, and sauces. These are discussed in Chapters 9-11.\n\n---\n\n**Glycogen**\n- **Description:** Often referred to as \"animal starch,\" glycogen is an animal-derived carbohydrate resembling amylopectin but is more highly branched.\n\n---\n\n**Visual Diagrams**\n- **Chemical Structure:** Shows stylized molecular diagrams of glucose, amylose, and amylopectin to clarify their structural differences. \n- **Glucose:** Basic chemical formula depicted, emphasizing its foundational role in forming more complex sugar chains.\n- **Amylose:** Illustration of a simple long chain of glucose molecules.\n- **Amylopectin:** Demonstrates its complex, highly branched structure.\n\n---\n\nThis text likely continues the discussion and analysis on carbohydrates, emphasizing their chemical structures, biological roles, and impacts on food properties, reserved for more detailed explanation in later chapters of the book."

Some honeys, like chestnut and buckwheat, are darker and have higher protein content due to rich nectars, influencing both their flavors (dark pigments) and aroma (toasted).\n\n2. **Process of Gathering Nectar:**\n   - **Description:** Bees collect nectar from flowers using a long proboscis to reach into nectaries. During the collection, bees pick up pollen, which is then carried through their esophagus into a honey sac, a storage unit, until they return to the hive. Special glands secrete enzymes into the sac to break down starch into sugars (glucose and fructose).\n\n3. **Remarkable Figures and Bee Labor:**\n   - **Bee Workload:** In the effort to produce surplus honey sold in markets, a single bee’s contribution includes around 25 round trips daily, each trip results in approximately 0.002 of an ounce of honey. The estimated path a bee covers for nectar for one pound of honey is equivalent to three orbits around the Earth.\n   - **Bee Community Structure:** The hive typically consists of one queen, a few hundred male drones, and about 20,000 female workers.\n   - **Distance Traveled:** Over their lifetime, bees can travel about 7 million miles, which generates roughly three million kilometers per liter of honey.\n\n4. **Historical Reference:**\n   - **The Advance of the Bee in North America:** A near-contemporary description from 1832 by Washington Irving in his book \"A Tour on the Prairies,\" where he details honey bee movements across North America and their interactions with indigenous communities and settlers.

There's a distinct firmness and espresso-like bitterness due to the acidity and tannin content of Sangiovese grapes, which are like Pinot Noir in being relatively high in acidity. Modern winemaking methods have managed to extract more color, power, and tannin from the grape. Sangiovese in Tuscan wines, when combined with high acidity and tannin, may not always be palatably enjoyable despite the high quality. The best Tuscan wines manage to balance these strong characteristics, offering a better experience, though they often require an acquired taste enhanced by a palate usually coated in olive oil as a countermeasure.\n\nThe document discusses that historically much of the produced red wine in Tuscany, except for the famous dessert wine \"vin santo,\" saw white wine production as an afterthought. However, the scenario is changing as many high-quality Tuscan white wines are being produced, often in modern styles like sauvignon blanc and chardonnay. It also mentions \"vernaccia di San Gimignano\" as a traditional Tuscan dry white wine that has seen improvements in quality in recent times.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "# Apple\n\nFruity, floral, green, spicy and cheesy are just some of the basic aroma descriptors for apples. Whether it is a **Boskoop**, a **Honeycrisp**, a **Fuji** or one of the several thousands of other apple varieties grown worldwide, there is an apple for everyone.\n\nToday's cultivars all trace their ancestry to a single species: _Malus sieversii_, which can still be found flourishing in Kazakhstan and China's Xinjiang province. This flavourful wild apple was domesticated some four thousand years ago in the Tien Shan mountains. Traders later sowed _M. sieversii_ seeds along the Silk Road, where it cross-pollinated with other wild species, most notably the tart-tasting European crab apple, _Malus sylvestris_. Humans went on to selectively breed new hybrid species for taste, texture, aroma, size and other qualities, such as resistance to pests and disease.\n\nVarieties with softer flesh are good for purees and making apple sauce. Apples are especially high in pectin, a naturally occurring starch that helps to thicken jellies, jams and other recipes. With so many flavorful varieties to choose from, it is no wonder this versatile fruit is a go-to ingredient in countless desserts, such as pies, tarts, crumbles, cobblers and cakes.\n\n- At Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year celebration, apple slices are dipped into honey to wish for a sweet and fruitful new year.\n- In North America, unfiltered apple juice is referred to as 'apple cider', which can also be fermented to make alcoholic 'hard cider' (known simply as 'cider' in Britain).\n- The best-known apple brandy is the double-distilled Calvados from the Pays d'Auge in Normandy, France, which has been granted Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) status. In recent years, Americans have re-embraced Applejack, a high-proof apple brandy that was traditionally freeze-distilled and aged in old bourbon barrels.\n\n## An apple for every taste\n\nIt is remarkable to think that all several thousand of today’s domesticated apple cultivars share the same genomes as _M. sieversii_ and _M. sylvestris_. Broadly speaking, this very likely explains why so many of the different cultivars share the same basic fruity, floral, green, spicy and cheesy aroma types. However, every apple cultivar has a unique aroma profile that is influenced by factors such as growing conditions, the stage of harvest and methods of storage – even the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide present in the storage area will affect the flavour of an apple.\n\nApples develop their flavour early on. As they grow, they produce both fatty acids and amino acids, which are broken down by enzymes and oxidation into new aroma compounds. The longer the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, the more fatty acids it will produce, allowing for a more complex flavour. Apples that are harvested too early lack flavour because their aroma profile is incomplete.\n\nThis can be a delicate balancing act, because some varieties (particularly the early season cultivars such as Discovery and Gala) do not store well. Apples such as these should be celebrated as soon as they are ripe, otherwise the flavour is affected and the texture becomes 'woolly'. Juicing is one way to make use of the harvest with minimal wastage.\n\nMost culinary varieties have a high level of acidity at first, but they store well and become sweeter with age, meaning that extra sweeteners are less necessary. Many late season apples can be kept for up to six months.\n\nThe aroma profile of a specific variety of apple contains a mixture of esters and aldehydes found in many other apple varieties: hexyl acetate is largely responsible for the generic fruity, apple smell, while the green apple-scented hexanal, trans-2-hexenal and butanal add fruity complexity. In addition to these shared character-impact compounds, each apple variety is characterized by a set of key odorants. This unique combination of volatile components is responsible for its distinct aromatic signature when experienced as a whole.\n\nA comparison of four popular varieties – Cox's Orange Pippin, Boskoop, Jonagold and Elstar – gives some sense of the diversity of flavour between different cultivars – each variety is characterized by a unique set of descriptors distinguishing it from the rest (see opposite and page 46)."

    "contenu": "The document discusses the viticulture history of Sonoma Valley, California. It highlights key events and figures in the development of its wine industry:\n\n1. **Early Vineyards**: It refutes the common belief that Sonoma’s first vineyards were planted by Spaniards, explaining instead that Russian fishermen, who arrived around the early nineteenth century, were the pioneers. These fishermen also created settlements near Fort Ross, deriving its name from ‘Rossiya’, which resembles the Russian word for Russia.\n\n2. **Spanish Influence**: By 1820, Franciscan fathers planted vineyards around the Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma. This mission, like other Spanish missions of the time, contributed to the agricultural development of the area.\n\n3. **Mexican Rule and U.S. Annexation**: After Mexico won its independence from Spain, it controlled California including Sonoma. However, by 1846, following the Mexican War of Independence, the U.S. annexed California. This period marked the beginning of a broader spread of viticulture in northern California using cuttings from Sonoma’s vines.\n\n4. **Agoston Haraszthy's Contributions**: Agoston Haraszthy, known as the “Father of the California Wine Industry”, was a significant figure who bought large tracts of land for vineyards in Sonoma. In 1857, he established Buena Vista, which became the largest winery in California. Haraszthy’s advocacy and promotional efforts for Sonoma as a viticulture hub led to a wave of French, German, and Italian immigrants establishing vineyards there from the late 1850s onwards.\n\nThe document effectively outlines the transformation of Sonoma into a key site for wine production in America, due to contributions from different cultural groups and strategic investments by key individuals like Haraszthy."

Below is a structured summary of the provided content for each type:\n\n### Parisian Shaker\n\n- **Image:** A two-piece cocktail shaker.\n- **Description:** The Parisian shaker is described as \"pretty cool looking\" but not as versatile or inexpensive as a standard set of metal shaking tins. To use it, one builds the drink in the smaller, top section, adds ice, and then taps the larger cup on top. As you shake, the cup will chill, contract, and seal around the top.\n\n### Cobbler Shaker\n\n- **Image:** A three-piece cocktail shaker with an integrated strainer.\n- **Description:** This shaker is noted as good for people with small hands and those who prefer fancy-looking shakers. However, it lacks versatility and the integrated strainer is not preferred by the author."

    "contenu": "# TRANSPORTING WINE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD\n\nOther than goatskin bags, the earliest vessels for transporting wine in the ancient world were amphorae, terra-cotta jars with two looped handles and, usually, a pointed base. Although the exact date and place in the eastern Mediterranean where these distinctive jars originated has often been debated, their history can be traced back to at least 2000 B.C. Around this time, the so-called Canaanite jars that were used to ship a variety of goods, including wine, were used in Canaan's extensive trade with pharaonic Egypt. By the thirteenth century B.C., such vessels were being shipped as far afield as mainland Greece, where they were found in the tombs of Mycenaean royalty. The hundreds of thousands of amphora fragments that have been uncovered by anthropologists attest to the enormous volume of commerce in antiquity, including trade in wine.\n\nWhile some small amphorae held about 2½ gallons (10 liters), the jars used in transporting wine were generally larger, holding 6½ gallons (25 liters) or more and weighing at least 22 pounds (10 kilograms) when empty. Filled with wine, an amphora would have been heavy, hence the practicality of two handles, allowing two people to carry the jar. Although the pointed base seems odd, it too, was pragmatic, offering a third \"handle\" when necessary. Such a design was also very functional on ships, where the pointed bases could be buried deep in sand and the handles of the jars tied together for stability. When they weren't being carried, amphorae would be leaned against the wall of a room or placed in special ring stands to hold them erect.\n\nSince different Greek city-states produced their own distinctive styles of amphorae, archaeologists theorize that the various jar shapes would have signaled different kinds of wine in the marketplace. In addition, before they were fired, the handles of many jars were stamped with information about the type, the origin, and often the date of the wine that the amphora contained.\n\nIn order to form an airtight seal and thereby prevent bacteria from turning the wine into vinegar, the narrow necks of ancient wine amphorae were sealed using one of a number of methods. Most commonly, the mouth of each amphora was filled with a clump of fibrous material, such as straw or grass, that had been soaked in pine resin, and was then capped with clay. Likewise, because the jars were porous, the insides of many amphorae were coated with resin in order to prevent or retard evaporation and oxidation. Since the resinous coating would have been soluble in alcohol, early Greek wines probably tasted as much of pine pitch as of the wine itself; in this way, they were the forerunners of modern retsina, the resinated Greek wine that is nothing if not an acquired taste. Sometime later, certainly by Roman times, lumps of pine pitch were also thrown into wine to help preserve it, or to disguise the flavor of a wine gone bad.\n\nFrom an amphora, wine would be poured into a bronze or pottery bowl called a krater. From the krater the wine might then be scooped out with a ladle called a kythos into a shallow, two-handled, often beautifully decorated cup known as a kylix."
