    "contenu": "The document discusses the Margaret River wine region in Western Australia. It begins by describing the geographical features of the region, highlighting the point where the Southern Ocean and the Indian Ocean meet. This area is notable for its warm Indian Ocean waters clashing with the colder waters of the Southern Ocean, which contributes to the climate and environment supportive of vine growing.\n\nThe region gained attention for its timber before becoming known as a developing fine wine region in the late 1960s, a surprising development considering that Western Australian districts like the Margaret River were quite isolated. The presence of grape vines in this area is comparatively recent with the first plantings in the late 1960s, over a century after they appeared in more established regions such as Napa Valley.\n\nDavid Hohnen, one of the key figures and an innovator in the Margaret River wine scene, founded the Cape Mentelle winery in 1970. He is also recognized for his work in New Zealand, identifying Marlborough as a potential major wine region.\n\nThe document goes on to mention the types of wine the region has become renowned for. While the area initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, chardonnay has now also become highly acclaimed, especially the Art Series Chardonnays from Leeuwin Estate, which are described as possessing a depth that intensifies with years of aging.\n\nLastly, despite the ideal climate conditions influenced by the ocean, vineyard management faces challenges such as bird threats during the ripening period of grapes, posing an obstacle as harvest approaches.\n\nThe text overall provides an overview of the Margaret River wine region's history, development, notable individuals, and the challenges faced in its pursuit of winemaking."

    "contenu": "### Pomegranate\n\nPomegranates have been cultivated since ancient times in what is now Iran, before spreading throughout the Mediterranean and northern India. Vegetal, bell-pepper-scented aroma molecules give the jewel-toned arils of this fruit a subtle earthy scent.\n\n#### Historical Usage\n- **Persian Cuisine**: Long before tomatoes were adopted into Iranian cuisine, the Persians regularly used pomegranate juice and pomegranate molasses in their cooking, and many traditional Persian recipes still call for pomegranates in some shape or form. Pomegranates owe much of their popularity today not only to their attractive color, which can vary from pale pink to ruby red, and the bursting juicy texture of the arils, which add interest to a dish, but also to their sweet-sour flavour. The fruit's astringency is due to tannins, such as Granatin B.\n- **Pomegranate Molasses**: Basically pomegranate juice that has been reduced to a thick, intensely flavored syrup – it is easy to make at home. Some store-bought versions may include sugar as a preservative and also to counteract the pomegranate juice's natural tartness. Try pomegranate molasses as a substitute for vinegar, honey or even lemon juice in vinaigrettes and dressings.\n- **Güllaç**: A Turkish dessert, usually prepared during the month of Ramadan. Paper-thin sheets of güllaç pastry are soaked in sweetened milk, flavoured with rose water and layered with crumbled walnuts. To finish, this sweet, creamy dessert is topped with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds and chopped pistachios – a precursor to baklava.\n\n#### Related Dishes\n- **Muhammara**: A Syrian dipping sauce adapted to various Middle Eastern cuisines, made from roasted red bell peppers, ground walnuts, breadcrumbs, garlic, cumin and olive oil, with pomegranate molasses added for acidity.\n- **Fesenjān**: An Iranian stew of chicken or duck and ground walnuts sweetened with pomegranate molasses.\n- **Anardana Powder**: A spice from dried pomegranate molasses, traditional in Indian and Persian cuisine, used to flavor meat. A modern product is pomegranate juice powder, which has an attractive pink colour. It has a similar flavour profile to the juice and can be used as a flavouring, or rehydrated and drunk.\n- **Grenadine**: A non-alcoholic syrup widely used for cocktails, such as the Tequila Sunrise. Originally it was made with pomegranate juice, although only a few brands continue to include this as an ingredient; many others have gone for cheaper juices, or even just flavouring. It adds an interesting mixture of sweet and sour, and a deep red colour.\n\n#### Cooking Tips\n- **Hummus Additions**: Try finishing your hummus with some pomegranate seeds and ground cumin – these two ingredients have spicy and citrusy notes in common.\n\n#### Related Aroma Profile: Pomegranate Molasses\nReducing pomegranate juice causes the loss of its key aroma molecules, leaving behind mostly caramellic-maple notes, plus some floral and cheesy-acidic ones that give this thick syrup its tart taste.\n\n#### Pomegranate Molasses Pairing Chart\n\n| Ingredient                 | Pairing Intensity (from 1 to 5 dots) |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Port/Fève cheese          | ✪✪✪✪✪                                |\n| Pan-fried venison         | ✪✪✪✪✪                                |\n| Calvados                  | ✪✪✪✪                                 |\n| Broad beans               | ✪✪✪✪                                 |\n| Toasted almond flakes     | ✪✪✪                                   |\n| Dulce de leche            | ✪✪✪                                   |\n| Horse mackerel            | ✪✪✪                                   |\n| Guava                     | ✪✪                                    |\n| Koikuchi (dark soy sauce) | ✪✪                                    |\n| Damask rose petals        | ✪✪                                    |"

    "contenu": "### 4.2 Le stockage et la conservation\n\nStocker et conserver le vin nécessitent une cave répondant à certains critères de qualité. Si le vin engendre un effort financier à l'achat, il mérite d’être conservé dans de bonnes conditions dans une cave \"idéale\" de manière à pouvoir être dégusté de façon optimale.\n\n#### La cave idéale\n\n- **Température**: les écarts brutaux de températures sont à éviter. La chaleur provoque une accélération de certaines réactions chimiques en entraînant un vieillissement prématuré. La température moyenne d'une cave se situe entre 10 et 12°C. La mise en place d’un thermomètre dans la cave est importante pour surveiller l'évolution de la température.\n- **Aération**: une aération lente mais constante apporte aux vins l'oxygène et l'humidité indispensables à leur murissement. La présence d’ouvertures facilite la circulation de l’air mais les courants d’air sont à éviter. L'hygrométrie idéale est de 75 à 80 %. L'excès d'humidité, nuisible à l'état des étiquettes qui deviennent illisibles et se décollent, peut être corrigé par l’installation d’un absorbeur d'humidité ou le dépôt de matériel sec sur le sol. Une sécheresse trop importante provoque la dessiccation des bouchons donc l’évaporation du vin. Recouvrir le sol de sable ou de graviers humides, placer un récipient rempli d'eau ou installer un climatiseur à eau ou à air, permet de lutter contre la sécheresse de certains sols.\n- **Lumière**: l'obscurité est nécessaire au bon vieillissement du vin. Au besoin, les ouvertures de la cave peuvent être occultées ou l’intensité de l’éclairage changée car la lumière altère la couleur du vin.\n- **Odeurs**: une bonne cave à vin ne contient que du vin. L'atmosphère doit être exempte de toutes odeurs nuisibles. Celles-ci altéreraient les vins qui respirent à travers le bouchon.\n- **Trépidations et vibrations**: elles sont principalement néfastes aux vieilles bouteilles car elles accélèrent le vieillissement.\n- **Sécurité de la cave**: pour protéger les bouteilles contre les vols, une porte blindée fermant à clé peut être installée.\n\n---\n\nDiapo x : La cave idéale"

Pectin helps form a firm gel by forming a network and bonding calcium tightly.\n   - **Application**: This method is employed in jam making, where the preserve is allowed to sit for a day for the pectin molecules to form the gel structure.\n\n3. **Candied Fruits**:\n   - **Description**: Fruits or pieces treated with saturated sugar syrup, impregnated, dried, and stored at room temperature.\n   - **Process Insight**: The fruit is first cooked in a sugar syrup which is concentrated each day to enhance the firmness and texture of the fruit.\n\n4. **Canning**:\n   - **Origins**: Introduced by Nicolas Appert around 1810.\n   - **Main Advantage**: Preserves food in nearly fresh condition without drying, salting, or souring.\n   - **Preservation Mechanism**: Involves high-heat to sterilize and seal the food in an airtight environment, preventing contamination and spoilage.\n   - **Food Safety Hazard**: Risk of botulism, particularly from bacteria Clostridium botulinum thriving in low-acid, low-oxygen environments. Precautions include ensuring a complete seal and possibly higher-than-boiling temperatures for certain foods in a pressure cooker to eliminate botulism spores.\n\nThe document provides detailed insight into various historical and modern methods of food preservation, highlighting the scientific principles involved as well as practical tips for ensuring food safety and quality."

Son goût est idéal pour s'insérer ou tofou.\n\n2. **Tofu lacto-fermenté**: Nature, aux olives ou au tamari, c’est un tofu riche grâce à la partie du lait de soja fermenté. Ainsi, il est plus riche en probiotiques, et sa saveur plus acidulée et plus fromagère que celle du tofu ferme.\n\n3. **Tofu mûre nature**: Sa consistance lui permet d’être découpé, pelé, mariné sans s’effriter, à condition de l’étuverer et de le presser (voir technique p. 88). Il existe également à la moutarde, aux herbes...\n\n4. **Tofu soyeux**: Onctueux comme un flan, c’est celui qu’on utilise pour les sauces, les desserts, les crèmes... Sa saveur est moins marquée que celle du tofu ferme.\n\n5. **Lait de soja**: Nature ou vanillé, il est souvent enrichi en calcium ou sucré. Vérifiez bien les étiquettes selon l'usage envisagé (voir technique, p. 86).\n\n6. **Poches de tofu frites**: Dites aussi bourrée-agé, il faut les plonger 1 minute dans l'eau bouillante puis les égoutter afin d’ôter l’huile excédentaire. Couplées en deux, elles forment une poche que l’on peut garnir, par exemple de riz, sushi (les insari sushi). On les utilise aussi coupées dans des soupes, des ragouts.\n\n7. **Peau de tofu sèche** (yuba): C’est la fine fleur du lait de soja, qui se forme lors de sa fabrication – comme la peau de lait elle peut se réhydrater lorsqu’on l’ébouillante, en utilisant des sushis. Elle garde de l’onctuosité après réhydratage.\n\n8. **Graines de soja jaunes dépelliculés**: Si on trouve aussi moins de graines de soja jaunes entières pour les préparer comme des haricots secs, le coté sec de la peau (nembekkicus) qu’on enlève pour faciliter le lait de soja.\n\n9. **Soja noir**: Il existe un soja de peau épaisse et noire, riche en polyphénols antioxydants. On en fait une pâte fermentée très aromatique, qui sert dans les soupes et marinades en Chine et au Japon essentiellement.\n\n10. **Protéines de soja texturées**: A base de farine de soja, elles sont particulièrement riches en protéines. Elles existent de plusieurs tailles et découpes (voir technique, p. 91 pour les préparer).\n\n11. **Edamame**: Soja frais en cosse, qui doit être bouilli environ 10 minutes avant d'être consommé éteide froid ou poud. Une autre technique consiste à les consommer à la dripping ou à les faire dorer au four avec leur cosses.\n\n12. **Vermicelles de soja**: Vendus la plupart du temps sous ce nom, ce sont de faux-amis: ils sont en fait à base de haricots mung, une légumineuse verte longtemps disséminée sous le nom de « soja vert » (voir technique, p. 81 pour leur cuisson).\n\n13. **Kinako** (farine de soja torréfiée): Farine de grains de soja torréfiée, elle est particulièrement savoureuse mais a tendance à rancir. À utiliser dans ses sobas, des creps...\n\n14. **Crème de soja**: Une alternative à la crème épaisse, à base de lait de soja, huile et épaisissants.\n\n15. **Tempeh**: Des graines de soja cuits fermentés avec un champignon formant des filaments blancs qui lient le en onctu bloc compact et croquant : une spécialité indonésienne champignon, de noisette et de fromage.\n\n16. **Sauce soja**: Source de terroir, on trouve des sauces de couleur et de goût variés, selon l'obscurcissement, la composition et la fermentation: les sauces chinoises, coréennes et japonaises sont les trois diverses. \n\n17. & 18. **Exhausteur de goût formidable**: Utilisé principalement à base de soja (miso, natto), ils sont indispensables à la cuisine végétarienne.\n\nThe document discusses different types of soy products, including their cooking methods and uses, providing a nuanced understanding of the diversity within soy-based foods. Each type of soy product is elaborated upon with specifics about preparation, characteristics, and culinary applications."

Classic examples of such aged, raw meats include country hams from the southeastern United States and Italian prosciutto.\n\n**Fermentation and Meat Products**\n- **Dispute on Fermentation:** There is ambiguity and debate concerning whether certain aged meats are truly fermented.\n- **Common Usage:** The term 'fermented' is primarily associated with dry-cured sausages rather than whole cuts like hams.\n- **Sugar’s Role in Sausages:** Frequently, sugars (e.g., dextrose) and carbohydrates are blended with the meat and salt during sausage preparation, providing essential nutrients for lactic acid bacteria, which play a significant role in the fermentation process.\n\n**Sterility and Microbiology of Dry-Cured Hams**\n- **Sterility of Internal Flesh:** In dry-cured meats that are not ground, such as hams, the internal parts are untouched by tools or hands and remain sterile from inception (as noted by Peter Zeuthen in the _Handbook of Fermented Meat and Poultry_).\n- **Microbial Influence:** Although carbohydrates mixed with the flesh are limited in influencing microbial activity by themselves, microbial action is minimal but still crucial in the ripening process, as detailed in a study published in the _Journal of Applied Microbiology_.\n- **Microflora Composition:** The typical microflora in these meat products includes Micrococcaceae, lactic acid bacteria, moulds, and yeasts, with the role of Micrococcaceae being significant.\n- **Halotolerant Microorganisms:** Their salt-tolerant nature allows them to survive throughout the manufacturing process of certain hams, continuously influencing the meat’s preservation and flavor.\n\nThe document integrates cited scientific perspectives and technical details to elucidate the complexities within meat curing and fermentation processes."

Here is the structured content of the document:\n\n### SECOND IN LINE\n\n#### Introduction\nThe document explains that to produce the best wine, top châteaux blend together their finest lots of wine, which poses the question about the fate of the remaining wine. These typically yield second wines with their own distinct labels and names, often nearly as good as the top wine but less renowned and usually less expensive.\n\n#### Second Wine Production\nSecond wines are crafted by the same winemakers and from the same vineyards as the château's premier wines, but they are from slightly older or younger vines and are not as complex.\n\n#### Marketing of Second Wines\nChâteaux generally do not heavily promote their second wines and prefer to be recognized by their main labels. The label on a second wine often does not disclose its château origin explicitly, but may have a name suggesting the connection.\n\n#### Examples of Second Wines and their Source Châteaux\nHere is a list of notable second wines and their corresponding châteaux:\n\n- **LE CARILLON DE L’ANGÉLUS** (Château Angélus)\n- **CARRUADES DE LAFITE** (Château Lafite-Rothschild)\n- **LE CLARENCE DE HAUT-BRION** (Château Haut-Brion)\n- **CLOS DU MARQUIS** (Château Léoville-Las Cases)\n- **LA CROIX DE BEAUCAILLOU** (Château Ducru-Beaucaillou)\n- **ECHO DE LYNCH-BAGES** (Château Lynch-Bages)\n- **LES FORTS DE LATOUR** (Château Latour)\n- **LES PAGODES DE COS** (Château Cos d'Estournel)\n- **PAVILLON ROUGE DU CHÂTEAU MARGAUX** (Château Margaux)\n- **LE PETIT CHEVAL** (Château Cheval Blanc)\n- **RESERVE DE LA COMTESSE** (Château Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande)\n\n#### Additional Information\nThe document concludes with a brief note about the hilly côtes wine regions in Bordeaux, mentioning that these wines are not as lush as those from regions like Pomerol or St.-Émilion, due to the less fertile soil and higher harvest yields. Some notable côtes wines include:\n\n- **Château Puygueraud** (Côtes de Francs)\n- **Château Roc de Cambes** (Côtes de Bourg)\n- **Château Les Jonqueyres** (Côtes de Blaye)\n- **Château de Francs** (Côtes de Francs)\n\nThis summary provides clarity on the production and marketing strategies associated with second wines, alongside examples from renowned châteaux."

The text details various aspects of the wine's production, regional adaptations, and distinct characteristics.\n\nHere's the content structured as main points:\n\n### Overview\n- **Popularity and Production**: Nebbiolo is not a mainstream grape in the U.S. but more familiar in Italy, specifically cultivated in regions like Piedmont’s Barolo and Barbaresco. Efforts by California's Cal-Ital movement are noted but limited.\n- **Cultivation Areas**: Beyond Italy, cultivation of Nebbiolo is noted in Australia, Argentina (Mendoza), New Zealand, and Chile. In the U.S., it's found in California, Washington's Red Mountain, Oregon's Rogue Valley.\n- **Market and Acceptance**: The variety struggles for market share in the U.S. despite the quality clones and mature vines.\n\n### Wine Characteristics and Choices\n- **Viticulture**: Discussed are the choices in viticulture such as clone selection and tannin management practices like micro-oxygenation. High elevation sites are preferred for better Nebbiolo growth characteristics.\n- **Wine Attributes**: Nebbiolo is known for its complexity, traditionally marked by its volatile and dried-out fruit and considerable aging potential.\n- **Decision Making in Production**: The text notes a shift in traditional terms used within the industry, replacing terms like \"sori\" and \"bricco\" with \"vigna\", though the transition brings some confusion in the sector.\n\n### Regional Specificities\n- **Italy**: Conterno’s Francia (Barolo), Cannuba (sourced by Chiarchlo, Priovato, Scavino and others), and Rabaja in Barbaresco (sourced by producers like Giacosa, Rocco, and Cortese) are highlighted as notable vineyards.\n- **Vineyard Preferences**: Importance of selecting the right vineyard with a preference for those with ample sun and stretching on south-facing slopes.\n\n### Aging and Consumption\n- **Aging**: Nebbiolo wines benefit from extended aging; traditionally, new vintages were not recommended for immediate consumption but suggested to be aged to enhance their qualities.\n- **Consumption**: Post aging, these wines are said to either result in a fabulous bottle or, more often than not, in a more ordinary experience.\n\nThis document appears to be geared towards educating or providing insights on Nebbiolo's cultivation strategies, regional growth patterns, and its market situation relative to other more popular wines."

Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n### Malting Barley\n\n- **Introduction to Malting:**\n  - Malting is discussed as the initial step in beer production, where hops are also added for flavor and preservation.\n  - It has become a specialized job with most beer makers outsourcing the malting of barley to specialists.\n\n- **Current Practice:**\n  - The narration mentions a small-scale brewery, Rogue Brewery in Newport, Oregon, which possesses in-house malting operations.\n  - In addition, there are a few homebrewers who choose to malt barley themselves, which indicates malting can be performed outside industrial settings without extreme difficulty.\n\n- **Historical Context and Scale Growth:**\n  - Historically, malting was an integral part of the brewing process.\n  - Over time, as breweries expanded, malting became a distinct and specialized industry, largely separate from breweries themselves. This led to the establishment of local and regional malt houses that supplied malt to multiple breweries.\n\n- **Centralization of Malting:**\n  - By the late 20th century, malting operations became highly centralized.\n  - A notable 1998 analysis found that in the U.S. and Canada alone, eight firms controlled 97 percent of malt production.\n\n- **Cultural Representation:**\n  - A book titled *Brew Chem 101* is cited, showing limited mainstream discussion on malting by noting that it dedicates only one sentence to the malting process, reflecting its rarity and specialization in contemporary homebrewing practices.\n\nThese details reflect the transformation and specialization in the production of malt, a key ingredient in beer brewing, and highlight instances where traditional practices are maintained by smaller entities and enthusiasts."

Below is the structured content derived from the image:\n\n---\n\n### WINE CONUNDRUM #1\n\n#### Introduction\nSensory scientists have suspected that the sequence in which wines are tasted can impact personal judgment about them. This was confirmed by a study in 2009 led by Antonia Mantonakis, Ph.D., from Brock University in Ontario, Canada, published in the journal *Psychological Science*.\n\n#### Study Details\nMantonakis and her colleagues asked volunteers to taste two, three, four, or five wines, whose labels were concealed, and then select a favorite. The participants varied in their level of knowledge about wines from novices to professionals.\n\n#### Findings\n- All wine samples were identical, unknown to the participants.\n- Every group of volunteers exhibited a preference for wine #1 over wines #2 and #3. \n- Among experts, wine #5 was often preferred, attributed to a \"recency effect.\"\n- Mantonakis theorizes that connoisseurs compare each new wine to previous ones more critically, increasing the likeliness of selecting the last sampled wine.\n- Novice wine drinkers felt overwhelmed with choices earlier and often preferred staying with wine #1.\n\n#### Additional Insights\n- Effective smelling of wine benefits from proper \"equipment\" such as a generous glass and a suitable anatomy.\n- Sensitivity to smell vastly differs among individuals. For a specific compound, sensitivity can vary up to ten thousand-fold between the most and least sensitive individuals.\n- The aroma of a wine is significantly influenced by temperature; for example, warm garlic has a stronger scent compared to cold garlic. Similarly, the temperature at which wine is served can enhance or mask its aroma.\n\n---\n\nThis content outlines the experiment's design and results, and it also covers additional remarks on how individual differences and circumstances can affect the wine tasting experience."

This was the beginning of canning, a form of preservation in which the food is first isolated from air and external contamination by microbes, and then heated sufficiently to destroy any microbes already in the food. (Pasteur hadn't yet proven the existence of microbes; Appert simply observed that all “ferments” were destroyed in his process.) When done properly, canning is quite effective: canned meat a century old has been eaten without harm, if also without much pleasure. The canning of meats is almost exclusively an industrial process today, in part because it offers the cook little in the way of desirable flavors or textures.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The text discusses the invention of the canning process by Nicolas Appert in the early 19th century.\n- It also touches on the limitations and industrial nature of meat canning in contemporary times, particularly noting the lack of desirable flavors or textures."

This makes their flesh relatively mild both fresh and old. \n\n### The Healthfulness of Fish Oils\nFish oil is beneficial because oceanic waters are colder than pastures, and the fish living in these waters are cold-blooded. Their bodies and the fish and plankton they eat have to stay fluid and workable at very cold temperatures, around 32°F/0°C, unlike terrestrial meat. \n\n### The Perishability of Fish and Shellfish\nFish and shellfish spoil faster than terrestrial meats due to their reliance on unsaturated fats remaining fluid at low temperatures. They require specific enzymes to operate effectively in the cold, contributing to their rapid spoilage when conditions change.\n\n### The Sensitivity and Fragility of Fish in the Pan\nFish can easily overcook and become tough, losing moisture in cooking. They require careful handling due to their muscle fibers being adapted to colder temperatures, where proteins fold at lower temperatures than those in terrestrial animals.\n\n### The Unpredictability of Fish Quality\nFish quality varies with seasons due to their life cycles of growth, maturing, and reproduction. During spawning, fish accumulate protease enzymes in their muscles, which affects their texture and quality.\n\n---\n\nThis structured summary highlights the primary topics discussed in the provided document page, outlining crucial information about the biological and culinary properties of fish."

The content explains different types of wines, primarily focusing on sweet wines and dry white wines. Here is the structured content from the document:\n\n### Title\nUnderstanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n### Sweet Wines\n- **Geographical Location:** Bordeaux applications grouped on the banks of the Garonne at its tributary the Ciron. These locations create ideal conditions for noble rot to develop on fully ripened grapes.\n- **Variability:** The level of noble rot varies from year to year, and Passerillage is needed to help concentrate sugars where there is little noble rot.\n- **Key Information:** The best wines come from Sauternes, located on the west bank of the Garonne.\n- **Grape Dominance:** In Sauternes and similar appellations, Semillon is the primary grape due to its thin skin and sensitivity to botrytis, while Sauvignon Blanc provides refreshing acidity and fruit aromas.\n\n### Premium Dry White Wines\n- **Appellations:** Certain appellations such as Entre-Deux-Mers, located between the Rivers Garonne and Dordogne, are permitted to produce high-quality dry white wines.\n- **Production Requirement:** In regions like Entre-Deux-Mers, only white wines can be produced, and red wines from this area are restricted.\n\n### Additional Information\n- **Sauternes Harvesting:** The grapes used for Sauternes must be selectively picked by hand since botrytis affects the ability to mechanize the harvesting process.\n- **Oak Influence:** Some wines, especially from Médoc and Sauternes, might have oak flavors due to fermentation or maturation in oak, contributing notes of toast and vanilla besides high acidity and potential sweetness.\n- **Appellation Rules:** Wines from specific areas like Graves and Pessac-Léognan need to adhere to classification rules for their naming and styles, which might restrict them from using broader or generic Bordeaux appellations."

For centuries, northern European and Near Eastern tribes moved through the region on their way to the Mediterranean. The overland spice routes ran through Friuli from the markets of the Byzantine Empire to Venice. Much later — before it became part of the newly formed country of Italy in 1866 — Friuli was the strategic Mediterranean port province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Even today, the region seems psychologically much closer to Austria than, say, to Rome. You can almost taste the proximity in the wines. More than any other wines in Italy, they have Teutonic precision, focus, and grip.\n\nAfter so many centuries of exposure to eclectic ethnic influences, cultural diversity, political jockeying, and mercantile bustle, the Friulians have been left with a sense of dynamism, a can-do spirit, and a healthy attitude when it comes to change. You can taste this, too, in the wines. As a group, Friulian wines are spirited, creative, highly varied, and wholly individualistic.\n\n---\n\n### Sidebar - THE QUICK SIP ON FRIULI-VENEZIA GIULIA:\n- **Vibrancy:** Many of Italy’s most vibrant, racy white wines are produced here.\n- **Top Varieties:** Friuli-Venezia Giulia’s top whites are sometimes 100% varietal wines, made entirely from varieties such as Friulano and ribolla gialla, and sometimes they are blends made from those varieties plus international varieties like pinot grigio (pinot gris), sauvignon blanc, and chardonnay.\n- **Red Wine Production:** Despite the renown accorded the region's whites, red wines account for almost half of the total production in Friuli. The most prestigious red grapes are merlot, cabernet sauvignon, and cabernet franc, as well as the native grape schioppettino, all of which are turned into stunning wines.\n\nIn a country where “real” wine generally means red wine, Friuli is acclaimed as one of the top places in the world for racy whites. In particular, Friuli’s pinot grigios, sauvignon blancs, and ribolla giallas can be stunning, as can its chardonnays. But if any white wine has captured the Friulian heart, it is one that is theirs alone: Friulano. (Before legislation in 2007 shortened its name, Friulano was called tocai Friulano, a term that confusingly implied a connection — where none exists — with Hungarian Tokaji.) Each of the grape varieties above is made into single-varietal wines and is used in the region’s numerous white blends, such as Vintage Tunina, a blend of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, ribolla gialla, malvasia, and picolit (the percentage of each grape variety in the composition is a secret) by the producer Jermann."

In 2009, to avoid confusion, the wine's associated grape name was changed when Prosecco-Conegliano-Valdobbiadene was elevated to DOCG status.\n  - *Modern Production*: Most Prosecco is now fully sparkling (brut), with a fruity flavor and a bitter edge attributable to the glera’s bitterness.\n  - *Production Method*: Unlike traditional sparkling wines which use the Champagne method, Prosecco is made using the Charmat process, where fermentation occurs in tanks rather than in bottles.\n- **Variants**:\n  1. Basic, inexpensive Prosecco: Produced from grapes grown at high yields.\n  2. High-quality Prosecco: Made from the best glera grapes located near Venice or between the villages of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene.\n  3. Rive: A premium level from small vineyards and specific vintages.\n- **Cultural Impact**: Frequently consumed in Venice bars in the evenings.\n- **Top Producers**:\n  1. Adriano Adami\n  2.
