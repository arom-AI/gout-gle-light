Can make beautifully aromatic, refreshing wines.\n- **Pinot Gris**: A major grape; it makes crisp, distinctive, high-quality whites.\n- **Riesling**: A major grape, made into sensational, concentrated, dry wines that are crisp and lively, as well as beautifully elegant icewines.\n- **Sauvignon Blanc**: An important grape; combined with sémillon, it makes good Bordeaux-style whites.\n- **Vidal Blanc**: A major French-American hybrid created in the 1930s in France. It makes what many consider to be among Canada's best icewines, as well as good dry table wines.\n- **Viognier**: A minor grape, but it can make amazingly beautiful, fresh wines in the Okanagan Valley in particular.\n\n## Reds\n\n- **Baco Noir**: A French-American hybrid; it makes simple, fruity wines in Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia.\n- **Cabernet Franc**: A major grape; it is made into sleek, dry reds in the manner of Chinon, from France’s Loire Valley and also red icewines.\n- **Cabernet Sauvignon**: Often blended with merlot to make good, if usually lean, Bordeaux-style blends.\n- **Gamay**: A minor grape, but it can make some amazingly fruity, fresh wines evocative of good Beaujolais.\n- **Merlot**: Made as a single variety and combined with cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc to make some good Bordeaux-style blends.\n- **Pinot Noir**: Canada's star red grape, especially in the Okanagan Valley, where it makes elegant, silky pinot noirs reminiscent of those made in Burgundy and Oregon.\n- **Syrah**: A minor grape in terms of production, but growing. Thus far, it is made into some exciting wines reminiscent of those of France’s northern Rhône Valley. Shows promise.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn particular, white varieties seem to soar with elegance and freshness. The best Canadian rieslings could fool you into thinking you’re drinking something from the Mosel region of Germany; the best chardonnays have a sense of precision that white Burgundies possess; the pinot gris are terrific wines—reminiscent of Alsace pinot gris; and the aromatic varieties gewürztraminer and viognier may have their best New World homes in Canada. As for red wines, pinot noir is the absolute star, making wines of world-class stature. Red wines based on Bordeaux varieties are, as of this writing, perhaps not as evolved, although cabernet franc shows promise."

Below is the structured content of the glossary entries provided in the document:\n\n---\n\n### Beerenauslese (BA)\n**Definition:** Literally \"select picking of berries,\" the German and Austrian category of wines made from the harvest of individually selected, overripe (botrytized) berries. These are produced only in exceptional years, when conditions allow.\n**Note:** Also see Qualitätswein mit Prädikat.\n\n### Bleeding\n**Definition:** In winemaking, this term refers to the translation of the French saignée. It involves the process of removing some of the fermenting must (pulp, juice, and skins) in red wines partway through alcoholic fermentation to concentrate the remaining wine-to-be. Often this \"bled\" wine, pinkish in hue, is fermented dry and made into a rosé wine called vin gris (gray wine).\n\n### Body\n**Definition:** Refers to the weight and texture of the wine as it appears in the glass (the viscosity as you swirl it) and as it tastes and feels in your mouth. \n**Degrees:** Body is directly related to the alcohol content of the wine and is described as ranging from light to full.\n\n### Botrytized\n**Definition:** Refers to grapes that have been affected by the \"noble rot,\" Botrytis cinerea, which affects grapes in conditions of alternating warm and wet weather. It attacks the grapes and dehydrates them without spoiling the natural balance of the fruit, thus intensifying flavor.\n\n### Bouquet\n**Definition:** The spectrum of scents associated with a wine as it ages and develops. Younger, fruity smells are often described as aroma rather than bouquet.\n\n### Clarity\n**Definition:** The absence of any debris in a wine. A clean-looking wine is a well-made wine, although the flavor may or may not be to your liking, and the degree of clarity has no effect on wine and food pairings.\n\n### Clone\n**Definition:** A selected, isolated, heat-treated, and disease-free selection of a specific grape varietal which has gone through rigorous cataloguing, segregation, and testing, required to be deemed worthy of carrying a unique name or code.\n\n### Complexity\n**Definition:** The presence of multiple layers of flavor and aroma. The more tastes you can perceive in the wine or food, the more complex it is said to be. While complexities can be fabulous with food, they are often best savored on their own, as their subtleties can be lost behind complicated recipes.\n\n### Cuvée\n**Definition:** The blending (or, in French, assemblage) of many wines, from different years, different varieties, or different vineyards.\n\n### Dryness\n**Definition:** A measure of the sweetness in a wine. Dryness is not the same as fruitiness; the level of fruit presence in a wine. Although ripe-fruit aromas may suggest sweetness, the wine may still be dry to the taste.\n\n### Earthiness\n**Definition:** Flavors suggesting the earth—dust, earth, mineral, slate, gravel, forest floor, humus, and even barnyard. Many wines, especially those from Western Europe, exhibit earthiness.\n\n### Eiswein\n**Definition:** Ice wine; a wine made from grapes that are harvested and pressed while frozen. While the specific details of Eiswein's flavor profile or use weren't detailed, it is noted as being distinct.\n\n---\n\nThis structured format provides each term with its definition and relevant notes or additional details, properly categorizing the wine-related terms in a clear, concise, and organized manner."

This variability teaches the importance of careful observation and technique, acknowledging that each outcome (such as batches of kombucha, bread, or yogurt) is different and should be celebrated rather than being uniform.\n\n2. **The Limits of Rules**: It emphasizes the insufficiency of rules alone to teach or guide practices effectively, like culturing food. Written instructions alone are not enough; there is a need for intuition and human interaction. The advice is to engage deeply with the process, seek guidance from others, and appreciate received wisdom without clinging to textual absolutes.\n\n3. **Value of Structure and Flexibility**: While acknowledging the limited capacity of rules, the document notes that structure and meticulousness—being systematic—can significantly aid success in any endeavor. However, life, like cooking, is compared to a stir-fry where flexibility and adaptability are key, encapsulating life’s infinite variabilities."

Instead of producing a single version of Barolo or Barbaresco, top producers make multiple versions of both, designating them according to the specific vineyard from which the wine originates. Top vineyards in France are referenced as cru vineyards.\n\n**Famous Vineyards:**\n- **Barolo:** Roche, Cannubi, Cerequio, Brunate, Bussia-Soprana\n- **Barbaresco:** Rabajà, Sorì Tildìn, Asili\n\n**Definition:**\n- **Nebbiolo:** Comes from the word \"nebbia,\" which means \"fog\" in Italian, hinting at the yeast forms on the grapes or possibly the wispy fogs at harvest time.\n\n**Regional Specialty near Alba:**\nAbout 20 miles northeast of Alba, Asti is renowned for its moscato (muscat blanc à petit grains). There are two famous moscato-based wines from Asti:\n- Low-alcohol wine moscato d’Asti\n- Slightly sweet sparkling wine Asti Spumante\n\nMoscato, the key white grape variety used, represents 22 percent of all plantings in the region.\n\n**Production in Alessandria:**\nLocated farthest east near the border with Lombardy and seated within the Monferrato range, Alessandria is recognized for producing red wines, specifically barbera and dolcetto.\n\n**Visual Highlight:**\nThere is a captioned black-and-white image showing small clusters of nebbiolo grapes at a Barolo producer’s vineyard identified as Roberto Verozio, illustrating the grape variety mentioned in the document."

    "contenu": "The document titled \"SUGARS AND SYRUPS\" discusses various aspects of sugar production and its historical development. Below is a breakdown of the content structured into sections:\n\n### Modern Sugar Refining\n- **Current Methods**: Sugar is produced by more advanced means today. It usually begins with the crystallization of raw, unrefined sugar in factories, followed by the refinement process to produce white sugar in industrial countries. Sugar beets, used mainly in Europe and North America, provide an easier way to refine sugar due to their suitability for factory processing.\n- **Production Steps**: The process involves crushing sugarcane to extract the juice, then boiling the juice. The boiling requires significant energy, and historically, these tasks were labor-intensive and environmentally damaging.\n\n### Impurities in White Sugar\n- **Refinement Challenges and Techniques**: Initial clarification of sugar involves using heat and lime to remove proteins and other impurities. Modern methods utilize equipment like centrifuges and spinner crystals to improve the efficiency and purity of the refined sugar, achieving a final sugar purity of about 99.85% sucrose.\n- **Influence of Impurities**: Even a minor fraction of impurities can affect the taste and color of sugar. These impurities might include leftover carbohydrate and pigment molecules that either get trapped during crystallization or influence the sugar's appearance.\n\n### From Sugarloaf to Sugar Cube\n- **Historical Context**: Until the late 19th century, sugar was typically sold in cone-shaped masses known as sugarloaves. In 1872, Henry Tate introduced an invention that cut sugarloaves into small, manageable cubes, revolutionizing the way sugar was sold and used.\n- **Henry Tate's Contribution**: Tate's innovation led him to significant commercial success and eventually to his role as a philanthropist, founding the Tate Gallery in British Art.\n\nThis document captures the technical and historical narrative of sugar production, describing both the improvements in manufacturing processes and the cultural impact through the product's format changes."

It also explains various types of specialty wines and details the specific process of making Champagne.\n\nHere is a structured breakdown of the document:\n\n### Wine Aging and Oxidation\n- **Overview**: Wine undergoes oxidation after it leaves the cask, which alters its properties, picking up some air when filled into the bottle.\n- **Oxidation Effects**: Although oxidation can lead to a decline in quality by making the wine more oxidative, certain wines like white and light-red rosés benefit from about a year of bottle aging, enhancing their aroma. Conversely, many red wines can age well for decades but lose their aroma and become harshly alcoholic.\n\n### Special Wines\n- **Accompaniment**: Specialty wines, which often accompany meals, vary and include sparkling, sweet, and fortified wines.\n- **Sparkling Wines**: \n  - **Champagne and Others**: Emission of bubbles from dissolved CO2, which is a by-product of fermentation.\n  - **Method**: Traditionally, to retain the bubbles, the Champagne method (méthode champenoise) involves a secondary fermentation in the bottle to keep the wine under pressure.\n\n### Making Champagne\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Base Wine**: Made primarily from Pinot Noir and/or Chardonnay grapes.\n  2. **Secondary Fermentation**: Involves closing the wine in a container to keep carbonation.\n  3. **Sugar Addition**: Sugar and yeast are added to aid fermentation under controlled temperatures.\n  4. **Sealing**: The bottles are corked, clamped, and stored at 55°F/13°C to maintain the desired conditions for secondary fermentation.\n\nThis approach focuses on the unique properties of wine as it ages and specific differences in the production of sparkling wines such as Champagne."

    "contenu": "## Lombardy\n\n### Introduction\nLombardy, or Lombardia in Italian, is Italy's most populous region and serves as the country's leading industrial zone. It is particularly renowned for Milan, its most significant city well-known for fashion and finance. Despite the prominence of industry, Lombardy also has a notable wine industry.\n\n### Wine Industry in Lombardy\nLombardy is not identified with a single grape variety but includes multiple varieties along with different styles of wine, including the well-known Franciacorta. Many sparkling wines are produced in this region, which features several Denominazioni di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCGs). Key areas for wine production include:\n- Valtellina (near Switzerland)\n- An area the southwest corner near Emilia-Romagna\n- Near the Veneto, east around the Franciacorta DOCG\n\nLocal sparkling wines benefit from historical tax exemptions dating back to the Middle Ages, due to their origination from certain towns, referred to as “curtes” in local dialect, which were exempt from taxes and consequently labeled \"franc\".\n\n### Prominent Styles and Methods\nWhile.sparkling wine is prominent throughout northern Italy, Lombardy's is notably sophisticated and traditionally made (similar to the Champagne method), resulting in high-quality, dry sparkling wines. These wines are primarily made from chardonnay and pinot noir (known locally as pinot nero), although pinot blanc (pinot bianco) is also permitted. Key distinguishing factors include the production method; Franciacorta wines, for example, are distinguished as ‘metodo tradizionale’ or ‘metodo classico’, akin to the traditional Champagne method. This method typically positions these wines in a more premium category.\n\n### Historical Significance and Recent Developments\nLombardy, traditionally rural with many convents and monasteries, began gaining more attention for Franciacorta in the 1970s largely due to the efforts of Berlucchi, a pioneering producer. Prestigious wine firms in the region include Bellavista, Ca’ del Bosco, and Cavalleri. The local industry's growth and global recognition highlight Lombardy's significant transformation and contemporary relevance in the wine industry.\n\n### Summary of Quick Sip on Lombardy\n- **Lombardy and Milan**: Known for industry and fashion but also notable for serious wines, especially sparklers.\n- **Franciacorta**: Most prestigious traditional-method sparkling wine from Italy produced here.\n- **Still Wines**: The region produces both white and red wines, supported by a wide variety of grape varieties.\n\nThis comprehensive overview highlights Lombardy's blend of industrial prowess and viticultural heritage, positioning it uniquely in both Italy and the global stage."

Here's the structured content of the document:\n\n### Geography and Appellation\n- The Médoc is a notable region starting at the city of Bordeaux, extending northward along the left bank of the Gironde Estuary for about fifty miles.\n- It consists of two smaller appellations:\n  1. The Médoc (northern third near where the Gironde empties into the Atlantic),\n  2. The Haut-Médoc (upper Médoc, farthest from Bordeaux and closest to the ocean).\n- Key villages in Haut-Médoc include Margaux, St.-Julien, Pauillac, and St.-Estèphe, famous for high-quality châteaux from the 1855 Classification.\n\n### Soil and Wine Quality\n- The Médoc region predominantly features gravelly soil along the river's edge which is conducive to viticulture.\n- Inland areas like the communes of Listrac and Moulis have heavier, less well-drained soils that generally produce less refined wines.\n\n### Viticulture\n- The primary grape varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, making up to 70% of all blends. The region's stony soil, interspersed with clay, supports these varietals well.\n\n### Historical Development\n- Historically, the Médoc was marshland, poorly suited for viticulture.\n- In the 17th century, drainage improvements initiated by the Bordeaux nobility with the help of Dutch engineers transformed the land substantially.\n- This led to significant land purchases by wealthy lawyers and merchants, the establishment of grand estates, and a viticultural revolution.\n- Prominent wine estates like Château Lafite-Rothschild, Château Latour, and Château Mouton-Rothschild were established during the 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the Médoc's geographical positioning, viticultural characteristics, and historical evolution as a major wine-producing region."

Start with your eyes. Look at the wine against a white background.**\n- **Observation**: Tilt the glass to observe the wine’s color which can range from nearly clear to deep gold, influenced by age and barrel storage.\n- **Aging effect**: White wines darken over time due to oxidation, similar to how sliced apples brown when exposed to air. Red wines move from pink-purple in youth to rust-brown in maturity.\n- **Texture and viscosity**: Unfiltered wines may show suspended pigment particles. Viscosity can be observed by swirling the wine and watching the formation and flow of wine beads.\n- **Note on color and flavor**: Darker wines (e.g., Shiraz) aren’t necessarily better in flavor even though they look more impressive. The color is due to thick-skinned grapes but has no taste itself. \n\n**2. Swirl the wine and take a sniff. Close your eyes. What do you smell?**\n- **Importance of smell**: Smell is a primary indicator of a wine’s flavor and should be noted before, during, and after each sip. \n- **Engagement with scents**: Encourages forming free associations based on what scents the wine evokes. This includes categorizing scents into groups such as fruit, earth, and wood.\n- **Memory and description**: Personal associations and descriptions help in recalling and identifying scents like \"lemon,\" \"French oak,\" or \"Santa Fe on a rainy day\".\n- **Sensory input**: Underscores the marginalized yet critical role of the olfactory sense in the modern tasting experience and its psychological impact through memory.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Detailed sensory engagement enhances the experience and appreciation of wine tasting.\n\n_Page Info: Wine Tasting, page 45_\n\n--- \n\nThis structured summary represents the key insights and instructions on how to visually and olfactorily examine wine as discussed in the document."

It starts with a personal anecdote about the writer's first experience with Michigan wine, specifically a riesling from Old Mission Peninsula, and expresses surprise at the quality of the wine despite Michigan's long-standing wine industry.\n\n### Key Points from the Document:\n- **History:** The Michigan wine industry began taking shape in 1939 with the establishment of the Michigan Wine Institute, a trade association aimed at benefiting local grape growers. Significant growth occurred with hybrids like Vidal Blanc initially, and later, the planting of vinifera varieties (chardonnay and riesling) in 1969 by Carl Banholzer and Leonard Olson at Tabor Hill Winery.\n  \n- **Development:** Lake Michigan's temperate shoreline encouraged the wine industry's expansion in the late 1970s, leading to the founding of key wineries like Leelanau Cellars, Fenn Valley Vineyards, and Good Harbor Vineyards. Large-scale plantings of vinifera began, particularly at Chateau Grand Traverse on Old Mission Peninsula.\n\n- **Geography and Climate:** Old Mission Peninsula, considered a vital American Viticultural Area (AVA), stretches 19 miles from Traverse City into Grand Traverse Bay. Its climate, moderated by nearby waters, helps to avert frost, extending the growing season.\n\n- **Current Landscape:** As of the document's writing, there are 93 wineries in Michigan. St. Julian Winery, Tabor Hill Winery, and Leelanau Cellars are among the most influential.\n\nThe information encapsulates the growth, challenges, and successes of the wine industry in Michigan, spotlighting its geographic advantages, historical progression, and key contributors to its development."

    "contenu": "# CHABLIS\n\nThe northernmost subregion of Burgundy, Chablis sits like an isolated island far north of the Côte d’Or and the rest of Burgundy. In fact, the vineyards of Chablis are closer to Champagne, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, than they are to the rest of Burgundy, more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) away. This far north, Chablis’s harsh, wet, and very cold temperatures are influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, and frosts in both spring and fall shorten the growing season. The wines, not surprisingly, are so crisp and racy that they vibrate with spring-loaded acidity.\n\nThe place itself is amazing looking. Vineyards roll this way and that, as if they grew on ocean waves. The whitish, crusty limestone soil—full of baby oyster shells and crinoids entroques (cousins of sea lilies and starfish)—is so stark that at twilight you feel as though you’re on the moon.\n\n## CHARDONNAY—THE PLACE\n\n**One of the historic, tiny villages in the Mâconnais region of Burgundy is called Chardonnay. The name is derived from the Latin Cardonnacum, which in turn comes from carduus, Latin for “a place with thistles.”** (Carduus is the genus for ninety species of thistles.) Interestingly, during the Roman era, a nobleman named Cardus is also thought to have owned the area where the village now exists. The village of Chardonnay and the surrounding Mâconnais region may indeed be where chardonnay was born as a natural crossing. DNA typing reveals chardonnay’s parents to be the red grape pinot noir and the white grape gouais blanc.\n\nWhile Chablis was justifiably famous in the late nineteenth century (its proximity to Paris ensured its reputation as a brasserie favorite), the wine is perhaps less well known today. The area, which suffered tremendously during the phylloxera crisis, had a difficult time regaining financial stability, and with the establishment of France’s major railway systems, cheaper, heartier wines were easily shipped north, weakening Chablis’s position even further. That said, the 2000s saw a resurgence of its popularity, perhaps because the minerally, steely flavors, exuberant freshness, and kinetic feel of Chablis are wholly different from chardonnay made anywhere else in the world, and thus the wine has, in a commercial sense, little competition. The French often call the unique flavors of a good Chablis goût de pierre à fusil—gunflint. When, with a great Premier or Grand Cru Chablis, these gunflint flavors are spiced by edgy minerality, the effect can be sensational.\n\nMost Chablis are made entirely in stainless steel to preserve the purity of their flavors. Some domaines ferment in stainless steel but go on to briefly age their Chablis in small, used oak barrels in order to deepen the wine’s flavors. Still other producers (a small number) barrel ferment their Chablis, especially their Grands Crus, which are thought to be intense enough to stand up to the oak’s impact.\n\nChablis has numerous Premier Crus and one Grand Cru—a magnificent sweeping hillside of Kimmeridgian limestone and marl covering 247 acres (100 hectares). Somewhat confusingly, the Grand Cru is known by the seven contiguous parcels—climats—situated along the hillside (leading some to imagine there are seven Grands Crus). These parcels are Blanchot, Bougros, Grenouilles, Les Clos, Les Preuses, Valmur, and Vaudésir."

The University of Oregon was the first entity in the United States to bring in these clones of pinot noir and chardonnay (clones are genetic subtypes of a variety; for more information, see page 30). Named after Dijon, the city in Burgundy where France’s ONIVINS plant materials laboratory is located, the numerous Dijon clones (with exciting names like 115, 667, and 777) are heralded for their complex flavors and ability to ripen fully in cool climates. In addition to Dijon clones, Willamette Valley pinot noirs are also often made from the Pommard clone, another well-suited clone from Burgundy.\n\n### CHEHALEM MOUNTAINS\n\nThis is a single, 20-mile-long (32-kilometer) landmass made up of several hilltops and ridges lifted up from the Willamette Valley floor. Parts of these hills (the south and southeast slopes) are mostly basalt and marine sediment; the more northern-facing slopes tend to be covered in loess. At more than 68,000 acres (27,500 hectares), this is the largest AVA within the Willamette. My top picks among the best producers include Adelsheim, Chehalem, and Ponzi.\n\n### DUNDEE HILLS\n\nA small group of hills, Dundee is where the Willamette Valley’s first pinot noir was planted, in 1965, by David Lett of Eyrie Vineyards. The area has unique red soils formed from ancient volcanic basalt. My top picks among the best producers include De Ponte, Domaine Drouhin, Stoller, and Domaine Serene.\n\n### EOLA-AMITY HILLS\n\nThis AVA is due west of the Van Duzer Corridor, a gap in the Coast Range, and thus is cool, thanks to exposure to air flowing in from the Pacific Ocean. Soils are a combination of volcanic basalt and marine sediment. My top picks among the best producers include Bethel Heights and Cristom."

Here's the structured content extracted:\n\n---\n\n### MILK BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY\n\n#### Fat Globules and Casein Proteins\n- **Diagram Explanation**: The diagram illustrates the components using a visual representation, mentioning **fat globules** and **casein proteins**, showing their distribution in milk.\n\n#### Milk Making Process\n- **Cells Role**: Cells in the cow's mammary gland synthesize proteins and globules of milk fat. \n- **Release Process**: These components are released into many small compartments that drain toward the teat, passing through cell outer membranes with parts of the cell membrane attached to their surface.\n\n#### Flavor and Chemical Dynamics\n- **Off-flavors**: Raw milk develops off-flavors more slowly than pasteurized milk, making it valued in traditional cheese making for enhancing flavor through its ripening process.\n- **Opacity Cause**: Milk's milky appearance is due to microscopic fat globules and protein bundles that deflect light, along with dissolved salts, milk sugar, vitamins, and other proteins. \n- **Main Components**: Milk's main components are water, sugar, fat, and proteins, which are crucial for its characteristics and effects.\n\n#### Milk Acidity and Vitamins\n- **Milk Acidity**: Mildly acidic with a pH between 6.5 and 6.7, where acidity and salt concentration significantly affect the protein behavior.\n- **Vitamin Content**: Fat globules carry colorless vitamin A and its orange-colored precursors, the carotenes, found in green feed. The extent of carotene conversion to vitamin A differs among cattle breeds and affects the color and nutritional value of the milk. For instance, Guernsey and Jersey cows convert less carotene, yielding golden milk, while other animals like sheep, goats, and water buffalo process nearly all their carotene.\n\n#### Milk Sugar: Lactose\n- **Definition and Composition**: Lactose, the only carbohydrate in milk in any significant amount, consists of two sugars, glucose and galactose, which are produced in the mammary gland.\n- **Nutritional Role**: It provides nearly half of the calories in human milk and about 40% in cow's milk, contributing to its sweetness.\n- **Digestive Challenges**: Many adults lack the enzyme lactase necessary to digest lactose, leading to potential digestion issues. Additionally, most microbes take time to make their enzyme to digest lactose, affecting how they can grow in milk. \n\n\u0017---\n\nThis page provides a detailed chemical and biological insight into how milk is produced, its components, and its implications in diet and digestion."

Plan des bâtiments\n\n- **Building Layout**: The winery is situated in a building leased since 2010 with different areas designed for specific activities across two levels.\n  - **Ground Floor**: Includes areas for reception (1), pressing (2), storing dry goods and wines (3), hygiene products (4), office space and product conservation (5), and a wooden footbridge for easy access between the vats (6).\n  - **Basement**: Dedicated to technical equipment storage and aging wine in barrels (8) and bottles.\n  - **Thermal Properties**: The upper level's insulation permits water access at temperatures from 0 to -1 °C, maintaining around 5°C year-round with no equipment to modify the humidity.\n\n#### b. Gestion du matériel technique\n\n1. **Reception**\n   - North side entry allows grape delivery either full or destemmed directly into vats using a conveyor system. The conveyors and destemming machine (Oenograppe OE9 from PMH Vinicole) handle 5 to 9 tons per hour.\n\n2. **Pressurage (Pressing)**\n   - Utilizes a Smart Press SPC 30 from Pera Pellenc, enclosed with a 30 hL volume, measuring 2.85 m in length and 1.6m in width. Features include axial and side filling, stainless steel and membrane materials, removable draining grids, and optimized for long air contact avoidance to preserve grapes’ natural qualities.\n\nThis summary covers the structured division of the production facilities and the technical materials’ management strategies employed by the vineyard, reflecting advanced technological utilization in winemaking processes."
