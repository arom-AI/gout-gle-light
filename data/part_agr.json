Here is a structured representation of the content provided:\n\n**Title**: Preserving Fruits and Vegetables\n\n**Page Number**: 299\n\n**Content Summary**:\n- The document discusses the impact of bacterial growth on preserved foods, emphasizing that items showing evidence of gas production (a sign of bacterial growth) should be discarded.\n- It specifically addresses the acidity of tomatoes and many common fruits, noting that their low pH helps inhibit the growth of botulism bacteria.\n- For foods like tomatoes and certain fruits, which are high in acidity, less severe canning treatments are effective. The recommended treatment duration is approximately 30 minutes.\n- Conversely, most vegetables are less acidic (with a pH of 5 or 6) and more vulnerable to bacteria and molds. For these, the document recommends a more intense preservation method, involving a pressure cooker at temperatures of 240°F/116°C for a duration of 30 to 90 minutes. These vegetables are typically heated using a bath of boiling water that reaches temperatures between 185°F–195°F/85–90°C.\n\nThe text provides specific technical information useful for individuals interested in canning and preserving various types of fruits and vegetables to ensure safety from bacterial and mold growth."

    "contenu": "### THE LAW OF MEZZADRIA\n\nAs late as 1960, the relationship of landowners to land workers in Italy was feudal in nature and governed by the law of **mezzadria**. For centuries, much of the Italian countryside had been divided into many fattorie (\"large farms\") owned by wealthy, aristocratic, often absent landowners. Each fattoria was made up of ten to twelve poderi (\"small farms\"). Each podere covered about 20 acres and was worked by one peasant family (the **mezzadri**). The agriculture of the podere was promiscuo—a mixture of olives, corn, wheat, wine grapes, vegetables, fruit trees, sheep, and chickens—virtually everything the literally penniless working family needed to survive. Of the total production, 51 percent went to the landowner; the mezzadri (from mezza, meaning \"half\") kept 49 percent as payment for their labor. The system—essentially sharecropping—kept the mezzadri in a constant state of poverty, and ensured an incapacitating status quo among landowners who relied on unpaid labor to keep agriculture afloat.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s the system of mezzadria slowly dissolved, but not without a huge impact on Italian farms (many of which were abandoned), agriculture (which subsequently became far more industrialized), and social structure (farmers moved to better-paying jobs in cities). In Tuscany, where many deserted properties were later bought and restored as second homes for upper-middle-class city dwellers, wine estates are often still known as either fattorie or poderi (Fattoria di Felsina, Fattoria di Monteverine, Podere Il Palazzino). And some small Tuscan vineyards remain as they have been for decades, planted not only with several varieties of grapes but also with fruit and olive trees scattered among the vines.\n\n### The Meso-climates of Chianti Classico\n\nThe meso-climates of Chianti Classico are multiple and diverse, thanks to the undulating hills and the variations in geology. The ancient communes of Panzano, Radda, Gaiole, and Castellina, for example, slope toward the basin of Siena—once a prehistoric lake. The Thyrenian Sea is close enough to bring cooling, dry breezes that help minimize the humidity. The grapes, the best of which are planted on south- and southwest-facing slopes, mature gradually over a long summer of warm Mediterranean days and cool nights.\n\n### Soil Diversity in Chianti Classico\n\nIf the meso-climates are diverse, so are the soils. Many of what are considered the best sites are on well-drained, fractured rock and stone, including the schist locally known as galestro. These give the most structured wines. But there are also sites interspersed with limestone, which tend to yield wines higher in acidity, and sites with more clay, which is less well drained and tends to lead to gentler, softer wines.\n\n### Legal Composition of Chianti Classico\n\nBy law, Chianti Classico can be composed of 80 to 100 percent sangiovese, and up to 20 percent canaiolo, colorino, cabernet sauvignon, and/or merlot. *Riservas*—Chianti Classicos that have been aged for an extra period of time—must abide by these percentages as well.\n\n### Role of Cabernet Sauvignon in Chianti Classico\n\nA word about cabernet sauvignon, which sometimes figures in small amounts in the Chianti Classico blend. Unlike sangiovese, cabernet is relatively easy to grow and make into wine, and it’s a known commodity in the international wine marketplace. But from a flavor standpoint, the two grapes are odd bedfellows. Sangiovese, after all, tends to be delicate and high in acidity; cabernet is dense, bold, and high in tannin. It’s easy for even small amounts of cabernet to take over a wine’s flavor, leaving the delicate nuances of sangiovese far behind. Tuscan winemakers have been well aware of this challenge for a good three decades. In every wine where cabernet is part of the blend, the goal is to allow the flavors of sangiovese to shine through, and indeed, some of the most balanced and nuanced Chianti Classicos are now being made."

Here's an outline of the key points presented in the text:\n\n1. **Geographical Context**:\n   - The Aegean Islands of Greece are highlighted as one of the windiest wine regions globally. This environment affects the growth of vines, which cannot be supported by even resilient plants like the olive tree.\n\n2. **Vine Training and Growth**:\n   - Vines in these windy areas are trained in a circular manner, staying close to the ground, resembling large doughnuts. This training technique is used to mitigate damage from strong winds.\n   - Each vine grows horizontally, forming a 'stefáni' (crown) and can continue in this manner for about twenty years before the trunk becomes robust enough to withstand harsh winds and maintain a more upright position.\n\n3. **Impact of Wind on Vineyards**:\n   - While gentle breezes are beneficial as they help cool the grapes and promote air circulation (which protects against rot), stronger winds can be detrimental.\n   - Severe winds can prevent the proper setting of flowers by scattering them, which means they do not fertilize and turn into grapes.\n   - Strong winds can also physically damage the vine by breaking tender parts, damaging canes, bruising leaves, and ripping fruit.\n   - Harsh winds can force vines to close their stomata, tiny openings in the underside of leaves that allow for evaporation, thus reducing the vine’s ability to draw water from the roots, ultimately stalling growth.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the adverse conditions persist, the overall growth of the vineyard can be severely hampered, ceasing once stomata close and the water supply is disrupted.\n\nThis document highlights the challenges of cultivating grapes in extremely windy conditions and the adaptations necessary for successful viticulture in such regions."

Here's the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n### Common Elements in Winemaking and Maturation\n\n#### Closures\nA bottle, whether glass or plastic, must use some form of closure to seal it. The closure selected can affect the wine's exposure to air and thus its longevity and taste profile. Different closures discussed include:\n\n1. **Cork**:\n   - The original and most widely used wine bottle closure.\n   - Allows a small amount of oxygen to gradually enter, seeking an optimal balance of primary and tertiary characteristics. However, cork taint and wine faults can occur due to issues like TCA (trichloroanisole).\n\n2. **Synthetic corks**:\n   - Made from plastics, historically used for wines intended to be consumed within a year of bottling.\n   - Modern versions are now designed for longer storage.\n\n3. **Screw caps**:\n   - Increasingly popular, especially in newer wine-producing regions like Australia and New Zealand.\n   - Provide an impermeable seal that helps preserve the fruit flavors without the faults that can arise from cork.\n\n#### Post-Bottling Maturation\n- Most wines are best consumed within a year of bottling as aging could lead to a loss of fresh primary fruit flavors.\n- Some wines benefit from aging and can develop robust and mature flavors over time. \n\nThe text also highlights the concerns with various closures like cork taint and the preservation capabilities of synthetic corks and screw caps. There's an emphasis on the importance of closures in influencing the shelf life and taste of the wine.\n\n### Visual Elements:\nThere's a sidebar on the same page containing images and descriptions of various types of closures:\n- Cork for still wine\n- Cork for sparkling wine\n- A stopper cork\n- A synthetic cork\n- A screw cap\n\nThis section provides visual context and further illustrates the diversity in closure types available to winemakers."

Despite its considerable size (700,000 acres/283,000 hectares), historical importance, and innovative winemaking, the region is still relatively unknown in the New World. Yet, a century ago, almost half of all French wine was made in this one place. Today about 25 percent still is.\n\nThe wines of the Languedoc-Roussillon cover a broad spectrum, from white to red, dry to sweet, still to sparkling, and even fortified (the famous fortified wine Banyuls is made here). But the region’s best wines are its reds, which possess a rustic, juicy, earthy/minerally/fruity “south of France flavor” that’s irresistible.\n\nThe Languedoc-Roussillon is sometimes called _le Midi_, loosely translated as “the land of the midday sun.”\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, when most vineyards here were in the care of monks, the wines were prized. In the fourteenth century, wines from certain parts of the Languedoc-Roussillon were so famous that the hospitals of Paris prescribed them for their healing powers. But for most of the twentieth century, the Languedoc (as it is often simply called) produced mostly the sort of no-name, no-frills vin ordinaire that was bought in bulk and cost less than water. (During the world wars, the ration of wine given daily to French soldiers usually came from here.) In fairness, there were small enclaves where making fine wine had always been important, but they were just that—small enclaves.\n\n### THE QUICK SIP ON LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON\n- **THE WINES** of Languedoc-Roussillon are the quintessential wines of southern France and represent the most exciting, best-value French wines.\n- **THE LANGUEDOC** is the largest wine-producing region in France. More wine is produced in this one area than in the entire United States.\n- **DOZENS OF GRAPE VARIETIES** are grown, from carignan, mourvèdre, and grenache (all of which originated next door in Spain), to French varieties such as syrah, cabernet sauvignon, and chardonnay.\n\nA transformation began in the 1980s, as the Languedoc became an insider’s paradise for bargain hunters seeking easy-to-drink French wines that go well with Mediterranean foods. The transformation was initiated at all levels of the industry, from small producers like Borie de Maurel, Domaine de Villemajou, Domaine de l’Hortus, Gilbert Alquier, Domaine de l’Aigle, and Mas de Daumas Gassac; to large companies, such as Fortant de France; and to very large (27 million gallons/102 million liters of wine a year!), quality-oriented cooperatives, such as Val d’Orbieu/UCCOAR."

It works well with the natural sharpness and acidity found in Greek cuisine.\n- **Shellfish:** It's safe to pair with solid rosé or white wine. Tannic wines should avoid strong-flavored bivalves like mussels and clams. Shrimp and scallops are also good matches.\n- **Salads:** Salads with dressings based on creamy yogurt or sour cream complement Xinomavro, provided oak-flavored wines are avoided.\n- **Vegetables:** Pairs well with Cabernet Franc, Carmenère, and Xinomavro itself. High acid content in these wines complements grilled vegetables effectively.\n- **Milder cheeses:** Benefits from pairing with aged and developed Xinomavro, which can highlight flavors in feta, washed-rind cheeses, and variations that include dried fruit and nuts.\n\nThe document underscores the versatility of Xinomavro, especially its ability to pair with a wide range of food groups, enhancing the dining experience."

    "contenu": "The text discusses various aspects of Gamay wine, including its characteristics, production methods, regional differences, and food pairings. Below is the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n---\n\n### Characteristics of Gamay Wine\n- **Fermentation**: Begins when the fermentation process starts within the grapes that remain intact, leading to wines with vibrant colors and exploding with sweet-tart berry fruit.\n- **Techniques**: Traditional fermentation sometimes involves the addition of whole fruit clusters, known as partial-carbonic or partial-whole-cluster fermentations. This dual fermentation approach is common in Beaujolais for Cru wines and other wines like Pinot Noir and Dolcetto.\n- **Shelf Life**: Beaujolais Nouveau has about a six-month shelf life.\n\n### Wine Attributes and Comparisons\n- **Soil**: Prefers granite and limestone soils, which add body to the wine.\n- **Flavor Intensity**: Varies due to soil composition, producing differences in flavor between wines from different regions like Saint-Amour and Fleurie.\n- **Aging**: Best and most consistent wines are said to come from vines that are over fifty years old.\n- **Defining Style**: Traditional Gamay wines mimic the production style of Pinot Noir, usually made in small barriques with some stainless-steel and glass-lined cement vats utilized.\n\n### Regional Varieties\n- **Burgundy**: Produces a blend called Passe Tout Grains, which mixes Pinot Noir with Gamay.\n- **Switzerland**: Known for Rosé de Gamay, considered Switzerland's best red wine.\n\n### Pairing with Food\n- **Compatibility**: Compatible with most foods due to its low tannins, bright acidity, and minimal oak influence.\n- **Classic Pairings**: Ideal with fish but versatile enough to complement everything from sophisticated Beaujolais crus to simple dry rosé.\n- **Meal Placement**: Better suited for early meal drinking, especially with composed salads.\n- **Specific Pairings**: Works well with creamy, textured dressings, charcuterie like duck-liver mousse, and rustic country pâté.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Gamay offers diversity and adaptability with a style suited from traditional meals to more modern culinary settings, highlighting its versatility as a wine.\n\n---"

    "contenu": "The document details \"Common Elements in Winemaking and Maturation,\" explaining essential factors and processes that are consistent across the production of various types of wine (white, red, rosé, and sweet). It emphasizes the importance of understanding the roles these elements play in winemaking and maturation to appreciate why wines are made the way they are.\n\n### Content Overview\n\n#### Different Winemaking Approaches\nWinemaking starts with grapes and ends with wine. The harvested grapes are processed and prepared for alcoholic fermentation, at which point yeast convert the sugars in the grape juice to alcohol. This entire process involves little to no human intervention beyond the necessary steps of harvesting, processing, and packaging, unless deliberately manipulated for achieving different taste profiles and wine styles.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Scientific Advances:** Developments in scientific knowledge and application options give winemakers a variety of methods to choose from.\n- **Control Level:** Winemakers differ in how much they control each part of the winemaking process. Some use scientific approaches to achieve specific goals.\n- **Hands-on vs. Hands-off Approach:** Some winemakers take a hands-on approach monitoring each step, whereas others prefer minimal intervention, which can lead to wines that taste more natural.\n\nThe chapter identifies that there are a spectrum of techniques in winemaking, from very hands-on to minimal intervention, this will primarily focus on the majority of techniques common today.\n\n#### Constituent Parts of Grapes\nThe document includes a diagram illustrating the key parts of a grape and elaborates on their roles in winemaking:\n\n- **Seeds and Stems:** Contain high levels of tannins and are retained at the discretion of the winemaker.\n- **Skins:** Contain high concentration of flavor compounds and tannins, affecting the taste and color of the wine.\n- **Pulp:** Consists mostly of water, which is the largest component, followed by sugar, then acids, which are crucial for taste and alcohol production.\n- **Tannins:** These are chemical compounds that impact the bitterness and astringency of the wine.\n- **Bloom:** Waxy surface on the skins containing yeast necessary for fermentation.\n\n#### Role of Oxygen\nThe text mentions oxygen as a critical component reacting with grape juice and other constituents during winemaking and maturation, influencing the end product significantly.\n\nOverall, the document provides a scientific and detailed overview of basic winemaking components and approaches, useful for both novices and professionals in understanding the craft of winemaking."

    "contenu": "The document is a section from a book about wine appreciation, focusing on judging the age and quality of wine based on color changes and how to plan when opening older bottles of wine. The content is structured as informational advice and includes two main points:\n\n1. **Color Changes with Aging and Can Be the Most Reliable Indicator of Whether a Wine is Still Good.**\n   - The text discusses how both white and red wines change color as they age, primarily due to oxidation. White wines darken and red wines fade, and sediment might accumulate, affecting the wine's clarity. The presence of brown or cloudy liquid often indicates that the wine might be past its prime. However, a golden hue in white wine or a red hue in red wine might suggest that the wine is still enjoyable. A brownish hue is generally alright unless the wine turns pure brown, which is typically only acceptable in Sherry.\n\n2. **The Best Way to Find Out is to Open the Bottle and Try It, But It’s a Good Idea to Have a Back-Up Plan.**\n   - It suggests that the preferable method of verifying the quality of wine is by tasting it, but also recommends keeping a backup plan. Mature wines should be paired thoughtfully, likely with salty foods rather than sweets, and particularly with a simple cheese plate for very aged wines. The text advises having a \"Plan B\" wine ready because as wines age, they are more likely to have deteriorated. Enjoying a meal or occasion means the former glory of a wine may not be apparent and flavors might not resonate well, hence the recommendation for a backup.\n\nThis section of the book ends with the reminder that having another wine option ensures the overall experience remains enjoyable, irrespective of the performance of the older wine."

    "contenu": "## Gewürztraminer\n\n**Overview:**\nGewürztraminer, often challenging to pronounce, is thought by some to be underappreciated due to its intimidating name. However, those who try it find it refreshing and straightforward in flavor, boasting a forcible personality which appeals to many. Despite its Germanic name, its pronunciation and taste suggest a wine that is not intimidating, but rather bold and direct, characterized by its accessibility and delicious flavor profile.\n\n**Wine-Growing Areas:**\n\n- **Origin**: The origin of Gewürztraminer is widely believed to be Germany. However, historical records suggest that Italians might have been the first to export the local grape Tramin (or Termeno) from Trentino-Alto Adige to Germany. The name \"Gewürz\" means spicy, reflecting the wine's unique bouquet and flavor profile which diverges significantly outside of Italy. In its native regions, it is less \"hot\" (sans coriander and cumin notes) and leans towards sweeter variants like cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.\n\n- **Noteworthy Growth Regions**:\n  - **Alsace, France**: Often considered the epitome of Gewürztraminer production, Alsace's variant is known for its rich texture and exotic, robust flavors consisting of ripe fruit (apples and pears) and sweet spices. These wines are usually dry (vendange tardive), and in exceptional years, sweet (sélection des grains nobles) versions are crafted akin to Riesling styles.\n  \n  - **Germany**: Though also cultivated in Germany, the Gewürztraminer from this country does not typically reach the same acclaim as those from Alsace, but it still presents a unique interpretation of the grape.\n\n- **Elsewhere in Europe**: Across Europe, Gewürztraminer is produced in varying qualities, typically showcasing a more subtle take on the flavors prominent in its northeastern Italian origins.\n\nThis document underscores Gewürztraminer’s uniqueness and its less-known details around European wine-growing areas, shedding light on both the historical origin and the contemporary appreciation of the wine."

Manzanilla and fino, for example, should be served very cold (like Champagne). Nutty amontillado should be served well chilled. And even the deepest-colored Sherries—palo cortado, oloroso, cream, and Pedro Ximénez—taste best served at cool room temperature. Ice cubes aren't out of the question. In the south of Spain, one of the most refreshing and ubiquitous cocktails is cream Sherry served over ice with a twist of orange.\n\n\n**Image Description:**\nBlack botas of Pedro Ximénez at Bodegas Tradicion. The bodega focuses exclusively on rare, old Sherries designated VOS or VORS.\n\n\n**Additional Information:**\nAs we've seen in The Seven Styles of Sherry (page 462), Pedro Ximénez is made into a rare Sherry of its own. Most Pedro Ximénez wines are nearly black in color and have a texture thicker than maple syrup. A thimbleful is more than dessert wine, it's dessert. To achieve this degree of sweetness and intensity, the grapes are picked and then laid out under the scorching sun for two to three weeks to dry and shrivel. Only when the sugar in them becomes very concentrated are the grapes slowly fermented into wine that will possess more than 40 percent (400 grams per liter) residual sugar. \n\n**Section: SOME OF THE BEST SHERRY PRODUCERS**\n\n**List of Producers:**\n- Barbadillo\n- Bodegas Tradición\n- Emilio Lustau\n- González Byass\n- Hidalgo\n- Osborne\n- Pedro Domecq\n- Sandeman\n- Valdespino\n- Williams & Humbert"

    "contenu": "### GAVI AND ARNEIS\n\nIn Piedmont, red wine has always been a religion, and white wine, something of a postscript. Nonetheless, a small number of good (and moderately expensive) white wines are being made in the region, notably those called Gavi and arneis. Gavi, the wine made around the village of Gavi, in the southeast, near the border with Liguria, once had more than just a local reputation. During the 1960s and 1970s, when Italy was in the midst of its fine wine revolution, many wine experts considered it the best dry white wine in the entire country. (Pinot grigio, at the time, was considered so characterless it didn’t warrant consideration.) By the 1980s, however, the stunning whites of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige began to challenge Gavi’s standing, and today they are far more highly thought of.\n\nGavi is made from the cortese grape, presumed to be native to Piedmont, and mentioned in early-seventeenth-century literature. At its best the wine is bone-dry and crisp, with citrus and mineral notes—pleasant enough, to be sure. About thirty estates specialize in Gavi, most in and around the small village of that name. The area’s proximity to the Ligurian coast, the Italian Riviera, has made Gavi a natural partner for seafood.\n\nArneis, which means “rascal” in the Piedmontese dialect, has gone through several fashion cycles. For decades, plantings were in decline, and there still isn’t very much produced, but in the mid-1980s arneis began to acquire underground cult status as another chic match for seafood in fashionable restaurants along the Ligurian coast. The vagaries of fashion notwithstanding, this can be a delicious wine—dry, lively (like that rascal), and fairly full in body, with light pear and apricot flavors. Arneis is made mostly in the hills of Roero, northwest of Alba. The best producers include Vietti, Ceretto, Bruno Giacosa, and Castello di Neive."

    "contenu": "# Labels and Politics\n\nIn 1989, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) issued a controversial regulation requiring wine bottles to carry the warning: \"(1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.\" No other country except Mexico has ever mandated a warning label on wine, and the Mexican label stipulates that abuse (as opposed to use) is not good for health.\n\nSoon after the rule was enacted, a well-known California-based wine importer named Kermit Lynch proposed balancing the warning with a statement about wine's benefits. He suggested Louis Pasteur's declaration that wine was the most hygienic beverage known to man. The bureau ruled that the quote was unacceptable. Lynch tried again, suggesting a biblical quote about wine's healing properties. Again, the bureau rejected the text.\n\nFinally, Lynch proposed two quotes from Thomas Jefferson. The first was turned down because, according to the BATF, Jefferson had implied that wine was healthy. The second read, \"Good wine is a necessity of life for me.\" That quote was considered acceptable long enough for Lynch to print 50,000 labels. Upon reconsideration, however, the bureau rescinded its decision, and Lynch was out the printing costs.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, Lynch decided to try one last time. He wrote to the BATF arguing that the phrase \"necessity of life\" did not imply that wine was healthful, merely that it was pleasurable. He also questioned whether it was the role of a governmental agency to censor Thomas Jefferson. Lynch's persistence paid off. Later that year the BATF finally approved Lynch's request. All bottles of wine imported by Kermit Lynch now carry Jefferson's statement affirming that wine was, for him, a \"necessity of life.\"\n\n# American Viticultural Areas\n\nIn the United States, the process of defining wine regions was begun in 1978, when the then Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (today, the Tax and Trade Bureau) began to draw up requirements for establishing the first American Viticultural Areas or AVAs. An AVA is defined as “a delimited grape growing region, distinguished by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been recognized and defined.” On United States wine labels, such place-names as Napa Valley, Finger Lakes, Willamette Valley, and Columbia Valley are all AVAs. The first American Viticultural Area was, curiously enough, Augusta, Missouri, approved in June 1980. The smallest AVA is Cole Ranch, in Mendocino, California, which comprises just a quarter square mile. The largest AVA is the Upper Mississippi River Valley. At 29,914 square miles (77,477 square kilometers; an area larger than Vermont), it is located in parts of four states—Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa. In total, there are now just over two hundred AVAs in the United States.\n\nAt first, it might seem as though American Viticultural Areas and European appellation systems are similar constructs. In fact, they are immensely different in critical ways. The appellation rules in European countries do not simply define the boundaries of a region. They also legally mandate a sweeping array of details, including which grape varieties can be used in the wine and in what percentages; vineyard and farming practices; how long and in what type of vessel the wine must be aged; the minimum and maximum alcohol of the final wine; and so on. By comparison, winemakers in the United States are free to plant whatever they want and to make wine in almost any way they want.\n\nSuch freedom has one drawback. The premise behind an AVA or an appellation is that it specifies a geographically unique area with distinguishing features. This definition allows for a greater variety of wine production methods and standards, potentially leading to a wider range of wine qualities."

    "contenu": "### THE MOSEL\n\nThe Mosel is where Germany’s most ravishingly elegant wines are made. The wine region—some 21,700 acres (8,800 hectares)—is defined by the hauntingly beautiful and eerily still Mosel River, which cuts a deep, snakelike gorge through the land. The river enters Germany where the country converges with Luxembourg and France, and then winds back and forth for about 145 miles (230 kilometers) northeast until it empties into the Rhine near the town of Koblenz. The Saar and the Ruwer are small tributaries of the Mosel.\n\nThe Mosel’s greatest grape is riesling. But that states the case too simplistically, for along the Mosel, riesling is turned into wines that have such crystalline clarity, they are like glittering sunlight on a subzero day.\n\nThe reasons are several. The vineyards of the Mosel are the steepest in Germany and among the steepest in the world. Indeed, the expanse of vineyards from the village of Zelting to the village of Bernkastel is considered the longest stretch of near-vertical vineyards anywhere on the globe. (As an aside, the severe inclines make these vineyards the most treacherous, dangerous, and exhausting to work of vineyards anywhere. Picture the typical vineyard worker, often a woman of about sixty years of age, who climbs these perilously steep, icy slopes in the middle of frigid November.) The vineyards are also among the most northern vineyards in Germany. Steepness in a cold, northern wine region means that the sun is in contact with the vines for limited, precious hours each day. And, of course, the total number of sunlight hours during the growing season is also modest (the Mosel gets, in a good year, about a third of the sunlight hours that Provence does)."

    "contenu": "### Aroma Types & Descriptors\n\n| Type        | Descriptor | Details |\n|-------------|------------|---------|\n| Fruity      | • apple, banana, berry, coconut, fruity, grape, peach, pineapple, tropical  | Esters play a key role in the aroma profiles of many fruits such as strawberries, bananas, pineapples and other tropical fruits. Depending on the concentration, lactones can have a peachy or coconut smell and are found in fruits, milk, cheeses and other dairy products. |\n| Floral      | • floral, geranium, honey, rose, violet  | Beta-damascenone, beta-ionone and (2)-1,5-octadien-3-one are responsible for the intoxicating fragrances of roses, violets and geraniums, while also leading their floral notes to ingredients like apples, pears, raspberries and sweet potatoes. |\n| Herbal      | • herbal, mint, thyme  | Menthol and thymol give fresh mint and thyme their distinct herbal notes. |\n| Caramel     | • caramel, maple  | Compounds like furaneol, maltol and soltone are characterized by the sweet caramellic smell of caramelized sugar and maple syrup. |\n| Nutty       | • hazelnut, nutty, tonka  | Benzaldehyde is the character impact compound in almond extract, while the intoxicatingly sweety hay-like fragrance of tonka beans comes from coumarin. Ketones provide hazelnuts with their distinctive smell. |\n| Spicy       | • anise, camphor, cinnamon, clove, cumin, pungent, spicy, vanilla  | Many of the warm notes in spices come from aroma molecules like cinnamaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, eugenol (cloves) and vanillin. Camphor and estragole (anise) offer more refreshing notes. |\n| Animal      | • animal, fishy, meaty  | Strong animal-like odours are associated with meat-based stocks and ingredients like venison or fish. Liver contains the aroma molecule indole, which can smell faecal, earthy, phenolic, perfumy or even floral. Skatole has a similar animal-like odour, described as smelling faecal or like a civet. |\n| Citrus      | • citrus, grapefruit, lemon, orange  | Lemons, limes, grapefruit and gooseberries contain mostly citrusy notes, which are also present in ingredients like coriander seeds, lemongrass and lemon balm. |\n| Green       | • cucumber, fatty, grass, green, oat flakes, waxy  | Green smells range from cucumber-ish to fatty (like olive oil), from freshly mowed grass to waxy (like orange peel), depending on the concentration of aldehydes. Milled grains also contain green volatile compounds that smell like oat flakes, while epoxides give seaweed a metallic note. |\n| Vegetable   | • bell pepper, cabbage, celery, garlic, mushroom, onion, potato  | Pyrazines, 1-octen-3-one and methional are largely responsible for the vegetal odors of bell peppers, mushrooms and potatoes. Alliums and brassicas contain sulphurous volatile compounds. Cooking creates new sulphurous, potato- and mushroom-scented aroma molecules. |\n| Roasted     | • coffee, earthy, fried, malty, popcorn, roasted  | The Maillard reaction causes new volatile compounds to form that smell roasted or popcorn-like. Some roasted descriptors smell malty or coffee-like, whereas pyrazines and geosmin have more of an earthy scent. |\n| Woody       | • balsamic, phenolic, pine, smoky, woody  | Some ingredients contain woody-scented terpenes and pinenes (pine). Using wood to grill, meat, fish or any other ingredients will impart the same woody, smoky flavours, whereas the process of cold-smoking fish or meats infuses their flesh with phenolic compounds. |\n| Cheesy      | • acidic, buttery, cheesy, creamy  | Cream, butter and ripe cheeses all contain cheesy notes. Vinegars and fermented dairy products like yogurt, buttermilk and sour cream contain other cheesy and acidic volatile compounds. |\n| Chemical    | • burnt, dusty, petroleum, soapy, solvent  | Burnt, musty, petroleum, soapy and solvent (as in paint or glue) are some of the descriptors used to describe the undesirable off-odours that develop as a result of improper storage or poor packaging. |"

    "contenu": "**Title: THE SOUTHERN PENINSULA: CAMPANIA, APULIA, BASILICATA, AND CALABRIA**\n\nWhen the ancient Greeks admiringly called Italy Oenotria, “the land of wine,” they were referring specifically to the southern peninsula—the toe, heel, and ankle of the Italian boot. In this rugged, sunny, mountainous land, they found scores of fascinating grape varieties. To these they contributed some of their own, establishing an even richer foundation of viticulture. By the time of the ancient Romans, the south was a treasure trove of wines, including the wine the Romans esteemed most: falernian, a wine (reports differ on whether it was white or red) produced on the slopes of Monte Massico, in Campania.\n\nAs in Greece itself, however, this auspicious beginning never evolved into the kind of future it seemed to promise. Today, the four regions of the southern peninsula—Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, and Calabria—make many easy-drinking wines, but comparatively few high-quality, famous wines. Admittedly, these regions have historically been among Italy’s poorest and most rural. The combination of poverty and a hot climate conducive to high yields has meant that quantity rather than quality has been the driving force behind the wines. Until recently, a lot of the wine here was not even bottled, but sold directly from the cask to local customers toting their own jugs.\n\n**Image Description:**\nA statue of the Roman emperor Augustus stands on the limestone cliffs of Capri off the coast of Naples in Campania. Enthralled by the island's beauty, Augustus built temples, aqueducts, and private villas on the island."

    "contenu": "The text in the document discusses treating apple juices with Pectinex Ultra SP-L, a substance that affects the clarity of the juice. It begins by describing the appearance of two different apple juices that have been treated with Pectinex Ultra SP-L: one from Granny Smith, which appears almost clear, and another from crabapple, which hasn’t settled at all.\n\nThe text then offers advice on preventing oxidation in apple juice, specifically by using vitamin C (ascorbic acid). It states that vitamin C and citric acid are not the same, with citric acid primarily being a flavor agent in lemons and not directly preventing browning. Instead, ascorbic acid is highlighted for its anti-browning properties. The text suggests either adding ascorbic acid powder to apples before juicing or incorporating it into the juice container during juicing. The recommended amount is about 2.5 grams (1 teaspoon) of ascorbic acid per liter of juice, which is noted as being higher than the amount typically used commercially.\n\nLastly, it mentions the visual and taste improvement when crabapple juice, previously depicted as unappealing in its raw form, is clarified through centrifuging. The clarified juice turns a gorgeous pink and, though the raw crabapple wasn’t appealing, the clarified juice is described as spectacular.\n\nThe document concludes with the assurance that following these instructions will yield fresh apple juice that tastes just like the apples it came from."
