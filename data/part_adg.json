    "contenu": "# THE QUICK SIP ON NEW YORK STATE\n\n**NEW YORK STATE's** modern wine industry, like all of the other major state wine industries, is based on fine wines made from *vinifera* species grape varieties. But up until two generations ago, the state was also known for a fascinating array of native American grapes and hybrids.\n\n**NEW YORK'S COOL** northern climate makes it well suited to producing not only dry, still table wines, but also lively sparkling wines, plus some excellent late-harvest and icewines.\n\n**OF NEW YORK'S** three major wine regions, the **Finger Lakes** is the fastest growing and accounts for almost half of the total wineries in the state.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nAlthough Dutch colonists attempted to grow grapes on Manhattan Island as early as 1647, viticulture and winemaking did not take serious hold until the nineteenth century, when French, Dutch, and English immigrants began planting vineyards on the rolling hills of the Hudson River Valley. From there, the immigrants pushed westward into the state’s stunning, remote, lake-clad interior. In particular, the Finger Lakes benefited from waves of German, French, and Swiss immigrants who were experienced at both grape growing and winemaking, and by the 1870s the Finger Lakes had become the heart of the New York wine industry. Steamboats laden with grapes and wine cruised back and forth doing a brisk business among the wineries that ringed the lakes. With the founding of the Geneva Experiment Station in the early 1880s, significant advances in grape breeding and viticulture led to leaps in quality among Finger Lakes wines.\n\nThe southern shores of Lake Erie, now one of the largest grape belts in the United States, were also planted with grapes around this time. The region, however, soon became a political stronghold for America’s nascent temperance movement. All too soon, growers who might have planted wine grapes were focusing on table grapes instead. Indeed, because grapes grown in the Lake Erie region today are mainly destined for jelly and juice (not wine), I’ve left the region out of this chapter.\n\n## POLITICAL BEGINNINGS\n\n**Two of the most culturally significant political movements in the history of the United States began in the wine regions of New York State**: the temperance movement and the women’s rights movement. The temperance movement began in Saratoga Springs and quickly spread to the Lake Erie region as early as 1808, eventually culminating in national Prohibition in 1920. The women’s rights movement began in Seneca Falls, in the Finger Lakes, with the first Women’s Rights Convention in 1848.\n\nFrom the end of Prohibition until the mid-1970s, the New York wine industry was controlled by a few powerful companies. As of 1976, there were only nineteen wineries in the state, most of them specializing in native American grapes, crosses, and hybrids. Small growers, their hands tied by exorbitant New York State licensing fees and bureaucratic red tape, grew grapes for a handful of big wineries rather than creating fine-wine brands of their own. By the middle of the 1970s, New York’s reputation as a producer of high-quality wines seemed to be sliding downhill fast.\n\nIn 1976, the critical turnaround came with the passage of the Farm Winery Act, which made operating a small winery economically feasible by permitting direct sales to consumers."

Sometime around 2009, every one of our bartenders fell hard for this fortified wine because of how its flavors and acidity mingle so well with other cocktail ingredients. (We also loved that it’s a cheap-as-hell base ingredient—you can buy a great bottle for under $12.) Joaquín was particularly smitten with the amontillado style of sherry, which is dry but smells sweet, leaving room for the bartender to add other sweeteners to a drink. In his Flor de Jerez, Joaquín uses rum to bring out the sherry’s darker, raisiny flavors, and apricot liqueur to bring out its fruity notes.\n\n#### Ingredients\n- **½ ounce** Appleton Estate Reserve Rum\n- **1½ ounces** Lustau Amontillado Sherry\n- **¼ ounce** Rothman & Winter Apricot Liqueur\n- **¼ ounce** Lemon Juice\n- **¼ ounce** Cane Sugar Syrup\n- **1 dash** Angostura Bitters\n\n#### Instructions\nShake all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a coupe.

Encasing in batter or breading is mentioned to prevent direct contact with high heat.\n   \n2. **Stir-Frying and Sweating**:\n   - **Stir-Frying**: Involves quick cooking on high heat in a small amount of oil to seal in flavors and prevent burning by stirring constantly. Preheating the pan and oil is crucial.\n   - **Sweating**: Described as cooking the vegetables slowly at low heat with oil to develop a flavor base without browning. This method allows flavors to blend while softening the vegetables.\n  \n3. **Grilling and Broiling**:\n   - These techniques utilize intense infrared radiation from coals, flames, or electrical elements to cook the food. Special attention is given to monitor the distance between the food and the heat source to avoid excessive drying or burning of the food surfaces.\n\n4. **Microwave Cooking**:\n   - Utilizes microwave radiation that selectively energizes the water molecules inside the food, heating it quickly and evenly. It's noted that microwaves have limited penetration and can unevenly cook thicker or irregularly shaped foods, suggesting that food should be cut uniformly. Retaining moisture through appropriate container selection is advised to avoid drying out the food.\n\nEach method discussed offers unique benefits and challenges, with specific tips provided to maximize the quality of cooked vegetables or fruits such as protecting food from intense direct heat, achieving desired textures, and preserving nutritional content."

The author tests several ratios of alcohol to egg white to see which preserves the character of the whiskey while stripping undesired components. Notable findings include:\n   - Using less egg white to liquor ratio (e.g., 20:1 and 40:1) found more favorable for preserving the whiskey's flavor.\n   - Comparisons are drawn to other methods such as milk washing, but it is noted that egg washing lacks the foaming power of milk.\n\n2. **Egg-Washing Technique and Ingredients Section**: This is a more instructive section detailing the specific technique and ingredients needed for egg washing.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the ingredients mentioned within the technique:\n\n```markdown\n### Egg-Washing Technique\n\n#### Ingredients\n- 1 extra-large egg white (approximately 32 grams, after removing the yolk and the stuff stuck in the shell)\n- 1 ounce (30 ml) filtered water\n- 750 ml of your choice of liquor at 40% alcohol by volume or higher\n```\n\nThe document highlights that using a higher alcohol by volume liquor is more effective since lower-proof liquors may coagulate the egg harder, making it less effective in the egg-washing process."

Allergic reactions can be severe as the allergenic proteins in nuts persist even after cooking and are found even in extracted nut oils.\n- **Gluten Sensitivity**:\n  - Classified as a form of food allergy mainly characterized by the body's defense against gliadin proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats, leading to conditions like celiac disease or sprue.\n\nThe text indicates that while seeds are incredibly beneficial nutritionally, they also pose risks in the form of allergens and defensive chemicals which may cause health issues in certain groups of individuals."

    "contenu": "The document is a portion of a presentation related to the wine region of Bordeaux, specifically focusing on the six families of Bordeaux wines. It is titled \"1.3 Les 6 familles de vins de Bordeaux,\" which translates to \"The 6 Families of Bordeaux Wines.\" \n\n### Content Overview:\n- **Introduction to Bordeaux Vineyards**: The Bordeaux region has 118,900 hectares of vineyards under Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC), making it the largest AOC wine region in France. This area is one and a half times larger than that of the Côtes du Rhône and five times larger than Beaujolais. In a global context, the size of Bordeaux's vineyards is comparable to the entire national vineyards of Germany or South Africa.\n\n- **Diversity of the Region**:\n  - The extensive vineyards are noted for their diverse soils, microclimates, and varietal combinations which produce a wide array of products within the Bordeaux designation: dry white wines, sweet Bordeaux (moelleux and liquoreux), red wines, rosé wines, clairets, sparkling Bordeaux, and even a local spirits known as eau-de-vie.\n\n- **Appellations and Wine Families**:\n  - Bordeaux comprises 60 controlled designation of origin (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée - AOC) labels. However, only a few of these labels are produced in significant volumes. The Bordeaux appellation wines constitute around 27% of all French AOC wines.\n  - Common characteristics among these wines have been grouped into six main families:\n    1. Dry white wines\n    2. Standard Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur\n    3. Côtes de Bordeaux\n    4. Saint-Emilion-Pomerol-Fronsac\n    5. Médoc and Graves\n    6. Sweet Bordeaux (moelleux and liquoreux)\n\n### Visuals Included:\n- **Map**: Shows the geographic location and extent of vineyards in Bordeaux along with a breakdown of specific areas such as Médoc and Graves among others.\n- **Infographic**: Illustrates the magnitude of Bordeaux vineyards in comparison to other known regions like Rhône and Alsace.\n\n### Extra Information:\n- Mention of \"Diapos 19 et 20\" likely refers to the upcoming sections/slides dealing with Bordeaux appellations and vineyards specifically, suggesting this presentation includes more detailed regional information in subsequent sections.\n\nThis structured information provides a comprehensive summary of Bordeaux's viticulture, emphasizing its significance in the global wine industry."

The page number is 31, indicating it is part of a larger document.\n\n### Main Topics Covered:\n1. **Transformation of Cream into Whipped Cream**: The text describes how the process of turning liquid cream into whipped cream involves the integration of air, creating tiny bubbles that are stabilized within the microscopically thin bubble walls due to fat concentration, which is around 30%. It mentions the role of the centrifugal separator in the commercial production of whipped cream.\n\n2. **Fat Stabilization in Foamed Cream**: A comparison is drawn between the foams formed from cream and those from proteins such as egg white, egg yolk, and milk. The text explains the mechanical aspect of how fat in cream stabilizes the foam. It discusses the initial foaming process, where fat globules begin to stabilize the foam, and the secondary process when over-whipping leads to destabilization and potential breakdown into butterfat.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Caption**: \"Whipped cream as seen through the scanning electron microscope. Left: A view showing the large cavity-like air bubbles and smaller spherical fat globules (the black bar represents 0.03 mm). Right: Close-up of an air bubble, showing the layer of partly coalesced fat that has stabilized the bubble (the bar represents 0.05 mm).\"\n- **Image Description**: The provided images are electron microscope captures. The left image shows the structure of whipped cream at a microscopic level, emphasizing the air bubbles and spherical fat globules. The right image focuses on an air bubble surrounded by a layer of coalescing fat that helps stabilize the structure.\n\n### Detailed Points:\n- The text thoroughly details the mechanics behind the transformation of cream into a stable whipped structure through physical agitation and the natural properties of the fat within the cream.\n- It underscores a critical threshold in the whipping process where the structure can transition from stable to a more broken down state, which can lead to the cream weeping or turning into butter.\n\nThis document provides insights into the scientific understanding and techniques behind the culinary application of whipping cream, making it relevant in fields ranging from food science to culinary arts."

Here is the structured content presented in the document:\n\n### THE QUICK SIP ON OREGON\n\n1. **Specialty of Oregon**:\n   - Oregon specializes in pinot noir, which is described as a temperamental grape that is considered to be one of the most sensual red wines in the world.\n\n2. **Climate**:\n   - Oregon's relatively cool, marginal climate is a significant factor that adds to the elegance of its top wines.\n\n3. **Geography**:\n   - The best wines in Oregon are predominantly from small appellations located in the Willamette Valley, situated in the northwest corner of the state.\n\n4. **History**:\n   - The Oregon wine industry began to gain recognition in 1961 with significant contributions from early pioneers like Richard Sommer and David Lett, the latter being considered the father of Oregon pinot noir.\n   - Sommer and Lett were among the pioneers who defied traditional agricultural advice and successfully cultivated vinifera-species grapes in Oregon.\n\n5. **Current State of The Industry**:\n   - As of the document's reporting, Oregon boasts over 20,000 acres (about 8,100 hectares) of vineyards and more than three hundred wineries.\n   - A major focus is on pinot noir, which is akin to the varieties found in Burgundy, France. Oregon is noted as one of the few regions outside of Europe to concentrate on a single grape variety.\n\n6. **Other Varieties**:\n   - While pinot noir is the dominant strain, Oregon also cultivates other grape varieties, primarily white grapes.\n   - Among these, chardonnay and pinot gris show promising results. Notably, pinot gris is highlighted as a straightforward and popular choice amongst local wine varieties.\n\nThe document also includes a photograph of David Lett with his son Jason Lett."

    "contenu": "**Marnie's Corner**\n\nSweetness is a major wine style factor, and it ranks among the first characteristics we learn to recognize. Most wine drinkers have a clear preference for either drier or sweeter wines, and they are frustrated that wines are rarely marked clearly. In fact, terms like *dry* may appear on the labels of wines that are anything but. If salsa can be labeled mild, medium, and hot, why not label wines *dry, off-dry,* and *sweet*? This proposition may sound sensible, but vintners resist referring to sweetness on labels unless doing so is established regional tradition. One problem is that there is little agreement on where to draw the line. Not only do individuals perceive sweetness differently, but cultures do as well. Wines considered dry in the United States may seem sugary to Italians. Food context is a major factor; sugar in food makes wine taste dramatically drier, and American food is sweeter than the cuisine of most countries. However, widespread among consumers is the erroneous association of sweetness with low quality. That perception is entirely inaccurate; there are, of course, world-class *off-dry* and sweet wines. But since cheap wines are often sugary and premium wines are often dry, it is sad but true that advertising sweetness can have a negative impact on perceived quality.\n\n**Wine Secrets**\n\nPage 56"

Additionally, there’s text on the WSET (Wine & Spirit Education Trust) themed slide which suggests that this document may be part of an educational presentation or material focusing on Burgundy's viticultural zones.\n\nThe text on the image includes the following topics:\n- **Climate**\n- **Weather hazards associated with the climate**\n- **Soils**\n\nThe map shows several distinct areas within Burgundy:\n1. **Chablis** - indicated in light turquoise, with sub-regions marked as Grand Cru.\n2. **Côte d'Or** - divided into:\n   - **Hautes Côtes de Nuits** - in purple\n   - **Côte de Nuits** - in dark pink\n   - **Hautes Côtes de Beaune** - in light pink\n   - **Côte de Beaune** - in coral pink\n3. **Côte Chalonnaise** - in orange\n4. **Mâconnais** - in yellow\n5. **Beaujolais** - in brown\n\nKey cities such as Dijon, Beaune, Chalon-sur-Saône, and Macon are also noted on the map. \n\nThe slide's content suggests further exploration of Burgundy’s climate, soil types, and weather challenges specific to viticulture, which are crucial factors affecting vine growth and grape quality in the region. This kind of information is valuable in a wine education context, providing insight into how environmental factors influence wine production."

    "contenu": "The content of the document discusses the labeling of wines in Mexico. Here is a structured representation:\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Lack of Denominations:** Mexico has no system of denominations of origin, which means that many wines are simply labeled as “product of Mexico”. Some labels might mention the valley where most of the grapes were grown.\n- **Regulatory Wine Laws:** There are no regulatory wine laws in Mexico that dictate the order in which grape varieties must be listed on a wine label.\n- **Label Information:** The order in which grape varieties are listed on a wine label does not necessarily reflect their dominance in the blend. For example, a wine labeled as tempranillo, cabernet sauvignon, and syrah could predominantly be made from syrah.\n\nThese points summarize how wine labeling and regulation in Mexico differ notably from more tightly controlled wine regions."
