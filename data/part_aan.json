    "contenu": "### UNDERSTANDING HOW GERMAN WINE IS ORGANIZED AND CATEGORIZED\n\nUnderstanding how German wines are organized and categorized is not difficult, but it’s not self-evident either. So, in my experience, it’s helpful to have someone take you through, step by step in a logical manner. I’ll do my best in the pages that follow. First, let me set the context, because in this case, context is critical.\n\nIn Germany, with vineyards so far north, ripeness has always been the fulcrum around which everything else revolves. As mentioned, however, climate change has thrown a wrench (a good one) into the old system. Over the past decade, contemporary German winemakers have been ecstatic to find themselves benefiting from a climate of which their fathers could have only dreamed. But the dramatic shift in climate has also turned Germany’s fine wine industry upside down and, for some vintners, created a whole new way of thinking about and categorizing wines. Here lies the rub: Not all Germans have adopted the new thinking. And almost worse, some Germans have adopted it only partially.\n\nSo for now, there are two main independent systems that exist more or less side by side. I’ll call them the traditional system and the modern system. The traditional system has been in place for many decades. The modern system was begun relatively recently by an organization of some two hundred prestigious estates called the VDP (Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter, or Association of German Prädikat Wine Estates). Alas, to understand German wine, you have to know both systems. And most important of all, know that some wine estates are adopting the modern system bit by bit, creating a hybrid world of their own between the two systems.\n\nOne final point: In addition to the two main systems at work in Germany, some regions—the Rheingau is one—have associations of members who have set up their own internal regional systems, and their own classifications. While we won’t telescope down to these small regional systems (many of which are currently in flux), I will address classification terms you might see on wine labels that could prove confusing."

    "contenu": "# In Praise of Delayed Gratification\n\nNo matter how delicious a young top Bordeaux is, it will almost always be more thrilling when it's older, after it's had a chance to evolve and reveal other facets and nuances of its personality. How much older? No one can say for sure. There is never one magic moment when a wine is ready. Most Bordeaux—most structured red wines—evolve and soften progressively. If they are very good, they usually go from being slightly tight to being supple and having a wider range of more complex flavors. But where a wine is along this spectrum at any point in time is a matter of conjecture. (And no matter where it stands on this spectrum, it will have its positive points.) Generally, the more structured the wine when young (i.e., the more tannin it has), the more slowly it will evolve. Since most top Bordeaux are very structured wines, they usually take at least eight or ten years of aging before beginning to soften and show more complex nuances. For a truly great Bordeaux, however, a good rule of thumb is to wait a decade before you think about opening it. Then add on another year (or however much you can bear) of delayed gratification time.\n\n## Access to the Best\n\nIf money is no object and one has the sort of access usually reserved for those in the Fortune 100, then drinking one of the Pauillac First Growths is certainly the best introduction possible to Pauillac flavors. But the cost of the Pauillac First Growths—in 2013, about $1,500 a bottle or more for a current vintage—effectively removes these wines from many people’s “must-try” list. There are, luckily, many other very good Pauillacs, including: Château Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande, Château Pichon-Longueville Baron, Château Lynch-Bages, Château Duhart-Milon, Château Pontet-Canet, Château Beychevelle, and Château Clerc-Milon.\n\n## St-Estèphe\n\nStacked on top of Pauillac is the northernmost Médoc commune of St.-Estèphe (SAN es-TEFF), known for wines that, at least by Bordeaux standards, have the staunchness of an army general and a sense of ruggedness from the commune’s heavier soil, closer to the mouth of the Gironde Estuary. (Many wines, as a result, are simply good, hearty Cru Bourgeois.) Only a few of the very top wines—notably Cos d'Estournel (which is so close to the border with Pauillac, you could hit a golf ball into the courtyard of Château Lafite-Rothschild)—have captivating intensity and exquisite concentration and profundity of flavor. Cos (the s is pronounced; the word is an old Gascon term for “hill”) makes a blatantly sensuous wine (about 65 percent merlot), with waves of chocolaty, pipe-tobacco-like, earthy, black currant fruit flavors that, when the wine is young, often seem to be bursting at the seams. The Asian-inspired nineteenth-century château itself, with its show-stopping copper pagoda roof and massive carved door, is one of the most intriguing in Bordeaux. Other top St.-Estèphes to seek out: Château Calon-Ségur and Château Montrose."

This grape and its wines are fashionable for many reasons: the name is easy to pronounce, and the wine is readily accessible stylistically, gussied up with lots of delicious and enticing oak. Whatever the reason, Chardonnay is the most popular white wine in the United States, and it is enjoyed and admired globally.\n\n**Wine-Growing Areas**\n\nAlthough Chardonnay is thought by some wine experts to have its roots in Persia, most of us associate it (correctly) with France, and specifically with the globally respected Côte de Beaune, the southern portion of Burgundy’s celebrated Côte d’Or. Chardonnay is, in winespeak, an older grape with an ancestry that is in part noble (the Burgundian Pinot family of grapes) and in part plebeian (its Pinot ancestry having been conjoined long ago with the unremarkable Gouais Blanc grape originating in central Europe). Once established in the Côte d’Or, however, the wines from such heralded appellations as Montrachet, Meursault, and Corton Charlemagne become benchmarks. Long-lived and infinitely complex when well made, great white Burgundies (almost all of them Chardonnays) are mosaics of mineral-scented earth, ripe citrus and tree fruit (apples and pears), and an intricacy of spice, toast, and varying levels of butter or butterscotch from the small oak barrels (barriques) in which they are aged. Additionally, the less oaky (or unoaked), more earth-driven styles of Chablis to the north and the Chardonnays of the Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais to the south present other interpretations, which are often excellent values. Wines coming from the Loire Valley and other parts of France, such as the Ardèche, don’t have the depth or complexity of their Burgundian cousins, but have the same unique terroir-driven palate and a similar quality of ripe but tart fruit. Finally, in the Champagne region, Chardonnay (especially from the Côte des Blancs) provides the sharp fruit and lemony backbone of nay."

It notes that the decision is not only esthetic but also practical in distinguishing between putting wine in a carafe and decanting it. Even though the end result looks the same, the purposes are different.\n\n2. **Specific Points Highlighted:**\n   - **Mise en carafe for red and tannic wines:** It's beneficial to put young, tannic red wines in a carafe to expose them to air. This helps the wine's aromas open up and soften the tannins, making the wine more pleasant.\n   - **Decanting aged wines:** Decanting is aimed at aged wines which might have sediment. The process involves careful pouring to separate the wine from its sediments and limit oxygen exposure to preserve quality.\n\n**Visual Aid:**\nThe page includes images related to the process of decanting and carafing, providing a visual reference for the text discussed.\n\n**Educational Context:**\nThe document seems to be a part of an educational slide or presentation indicated by \"Diapo x : Carafage et décantation\", suggesting this is part of a larger series or lecture, possibly for educational courses at \"L’Ecole du Vin\".\n\nThis section educates on the nuanced approaches required for different types of wines, emphasizing the practical aspects of exposure to oxygen and the avoidance of sediment disturbance in aged wines."

This process concentrates the remaining red wine since the ratio of skins to juice in the tank is increased when some juice is drawn off.\n\n- **SEC**\n  - Dry. When sec appears on a Champagne or sparkling wine label, the wine inside will be medium sweet to sweet.\n\n- **SÉLECTION DE GRAINS NOBLES**\n  - In Alsace, this term is for wines made from very-late-picked berries affected by BOTRYTIS CINEREA.\n\n- **SUR LIE**\n  - Literally, \"on the lees.\" Some white wines, notably from Burgundy, are left in contact with the lees (spent yeasts) after fermentation, giving them a creamy, rounder mouthfeel and complex flavors.\n\n### T\n\n- **TASTEVIN**\n  - A shallow, silver tasting cup used by a sommelier with dimpled sides reflecting candlelight in dark cellars, allowing the sommelier to observe the wine's color.\n\n- **TERROIR**\n  - A term reflecting every environmental factor affecting a given piece of ground including soil, slope, orientation to the sun, climate, etc. Each vineyard has its own terroir.\n\n### V\n\n- **VENDANGE TARDIVE**\n  - In Alsace, refers to wines made from late-picked, ripe grapes, which are not as sweet as SÉLECTION DE GRAINS NOBLES nor are they botrytized.\n\n- **VIGNERON**\n  - Literally, \"vine grower.\" Many French winemakers refer to themselves as vignerons.\n\n- **VIN DE GARDE**\n  - Wine meant to be saved or aged.\n\n- **VIN DE PAYS**\n  - Country wine from a specific region and less rigorously controlled than an APPELLATION D'ORIGINE CONTRÔLÉE wine.\n\n- **VIN DE TABLE**\n  - Table wine indicating a simple wine without an APPELLATION D'ORIGINE CONTRÔLÉE.\n\n- **VIN GRIS**\n  - A very pale rosé wine, sometimes light gray in color.\n\n- **VIN LIQUEUREUX**\n  - A very sweet, syrupy white wine made from grapes affected by BOTRYTIS CINEREA.\n\n- **VIN MOUSSEUX**\n  - Sparkling wine made either by secondary fermentation in a bottle or tank, or by the addition of carbon dioxide for inexpensive wines.\n\n- **VIN ORDINAIRE**\n  - Literally, \"ordinary wine\"—a plain wine with no regional or varietal characteristics, usually meant for everyday drinking. This is the opposite of VIN DE GARDE."

Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps depicted:\n\n1. **Grape Sorting**\n   - The initial step where grapes are sorted based on specific criteria such as ripeness and quality.\n\n2. **Crush and Destem**\n   - After sorting, the grapes are crushed and destemmed to prepare for juicing.\n\n3. **Skin Contact**\n   - This step involves the juice having contact with the grape skins, influencing the wine's aroma and flavor.\n\n4. **Press/Free Run Juice**\n   - The juice is extracted from the grapes, either by pressing or as free-running juice, after skin contact.\n\n5. **Clarification**\n   - The extracted juice is then clarified to remove solid particles.\n\n6. **Alcoholic Fermentation**\n   - The clarified juice undergoes alcoholic fermentation, converting the sugars in the juice into alcohol.\n\n7. **Rack Off Gross Lees**\n   - After fermentation, the wine is racked (transferred) off the gross lees (sediments of dead yeast cells and other particles).\n\n8. **Malolactic Conversion**\n   - Optionally, the wine may undergo malolactic conversion, a secondary fermentation process that converts sharp malic acid into softer lactic acid, changing the wine’s texture and flavor profile.\n\n9. **Blending**\n   - Various batches of wine may be blended to achieve the desired flavor characteristics.\n\n10. **Maturation (Inert/Oak/Lees)**\n    - The wine is matured, potentially in inert conditions, using oak barrels, or on lees (yeast sediments) to add complexity and nuances to the final product.\n\nThe image also suggests that the choice of production methods can lead to variations in the style (from dry to sweet) and quality (from premium to inexpensive) of the final wine product. The production steps are shown in blocks linked by arrows that indicate the flow of the process.\n\nThis flowchart is sourced from the WSET (Wine & Spirit Education Trust) as indicated by the logo in the upper left corner, and the process is detailed for educational purposes. Additionally, the corner mentions \"Issue 2 © WSET 2022\", indicating the version and copyright information."

    "contenu": "The document appears to be an excerpt from a book discussing a method in sausage production that involves the use of already-fermented sausage stuffing. This technique, termed \"backslopping,\" is analogous to culturing fresh milk with already-fermented yogurt. The document explains that microbiologists have identified specific bacterial strains, available commercially, which are believed to offer more consistent results than wild fermentation. Starting fermentation faster and reducing the lag time before pH begins to fall are highlighted as advantages, making sausage-making safer. \n\nThe text attributes these insights into sausage fermentation to Stanley and Adam Marianski, co-authors of \"The Art of Making Fermented Sausages.\" They mention that at the onset of the sausage-making process, large numbers of lactic acid bacteria (starter cultures) are added to the meat to ensure healthy and robust fermentation. This strategic addition helps beneficial bacteria outcompete undesirable bacteria, limiting their growth and survival chances.\n\nBelow the text, there is an image depicting a sausage maker at work, emphasizing the theme discussed in the text. This visual underlines the practical application of the fermentation techniques mentioned in the narrative. \n\nThis detailed explanation within the document provides a technical overview of a modern approach to improving the safety and consistency of sausage production through controlled microbial fermentation."

After the initial inspiration came the heavy lifting, and that took, in the words of the Beatles, “a little help from my friends.”\n\nVery special thanks to my wife, Barbara, for her unconditional support and patience as the wine bottles overtook the garage and the countless tastings cut into far too many family dinners. And to my kids, Elena and Adam, for humoring their dad’s passion and always happily sampling the recipes.\n\nI thank Connie Shib Cohn, this book’s manager, director, and planner, who deftly juggled reams of information about three dozen wines and their wineries, importers, and pricing, always with a smile. And Gary Woo, master recipe tester, whose skill and experienced palate made the food sing. Without his help I would have been frustrated and perhaps made adjustments and tweaks that wouldn’t work with the wines or respect the integrity of the chefs’ creations.\n\nI thank those thirty-six amazing chefs, my all-star lineup, whose inspired and delicious recipes add color and context to the wines, framing them and bringing out all of their wonderful attributes.\n\nA big thanks to my mother, Joyce, whose familiarity with cookbook structure helped me design a truly balanced set of recipes to accompany a wide range of wines and styles. And to my agent, Eric Lasher, whose clarity, good sense, and guidance are appreciated more than he knows.\n\nI also extend my gratitude to the team at University of California Press: my editor, Blake Edgar, who may be more passionate about these “daring” wines than anyone I know; to Dore Brown and Erika Büky for their expert fine-tuning of the text; and to Nola Burger, whose design and layout make the book look so good.
