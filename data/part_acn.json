They look like small white snowflakes.\n\n- **TASTEVIN**: See the French glossary.\n\n- **TERPENE**: An organic compound produced by a variety of plants, including grapevines, which can produce a strong aroma. Found in higher concentrations in gewürztraminer, muscat, riesling, and other German crosses. It is one of the highest concentrations of terpenes and smells of “terpene.”\n\n- **TERROIR**: The French term for earth. Casts an aura over the entirety of elements from vine to climate to earth, defining the inherent characteristics that come through in the wine.\n  \n- **THIN**: Describes a wine as lacking body, low in alcohol, and lacking fruit flavors, possibly due to grapes produced at a very high yield. Tastes watery.\n\n- **TOASTING**: Charring inside a new barrel to open flame. This process caramelizes the staves of the wood, giving the barrels treated this way their own unique vanilla, toasty character.\n\n- **TOPPING UP**: Adding more wine to a barrel or container to replace any wine lost through evaporation, preventing oxidation. This term is also used in more general circumstances to denote adding wine to a glass in which there's only a sip or two left.\n\n- **TRANSFER PROCESS**: A less expensive way to make sparkling wine than the traditional méthode champenoise (see the French Glossary). Involves secondary fermentation in individual bottles like in Champagne, but then involves riddling and disgorging in large tanks under pressure.\n\n- **TRUNK**: The vine’s permanent vertical stem, which grows out of the ground.\n\n- **TYPICITY**: The quality of a wine having the characteristic attributes typical of its region and grape variety. This is subjective but required by law for appellation status.\n\n- **ULLAGE**: The space that develops near the neck and shoulder inside a wine bottle or container due to leakage or evaporation. Wine with significant ullage will often be oxidized and depreciated in value.\n\n- **UNFILTERED**: Describes a wine that has not gone through filtration to clarify and remove yeast and other unwanted elements. Unfiltered wines might undergo fining to remove larger particles, and they can still be less than brilliantly clear.\n\n- **UNFINED**: Wine that has not undergone fining to remove large particulate matter or some tannins. Such wines emphasize the natural flavor and texture of the wine.\n\n- **UNOAKED**: Wine that has been fermented and aged in stainless steel or concrete instead of oak barrels, offering a more direct expression of the fruit's characteristics.\n\n- **VANILLIN**: A compound in oak barrels that imparts a flavor and smell reminiscent of vanilla to the wine. Newer barrels generally contain more vanillin compared to older ones."

    "contenu": "## The Keys to Understanding Food\n\nWhich comes first, the food or the wine? This question, like the chicken-and-egg dilemma, can lead people in circles, because the synergy between food and wine makes it impossible to make decisions about either one in isolation. But to know how a food might affect the way we perceive a good wine, we need to understand how various flavors and preparation techniques contribute to the taste of a finished dish. Now that we know how to define a wine’s ability to go with food, we need to get a handle on how to understand a dish.\n\nRecipes are as different as snowflakes; it’s impossible to pair up every recipe with a single perfect wine. As with wines, in thinking about any recipe the rationale remains the same: identify certain basic characteristics. Rather than get caught up in thinking about a dish in all its complexity, it’s far easier to look at the three food keys and then determine how to proceed.\n\n### Key 1. Ingredients\nWe have been “trained” to think about a dish primarily in terms of its ingredients. From a wine and food perspective, this approach allows you to think about pairings in a formulaic way: if you know the ingredients, you know the correct wine selection, right? Red meat with red wine, and white meat and fish with white wine. Well, sort of.\n\nCertainly, when you’re pairing wine and food, what’s cooking is important, and it’s often the main consideration. Of course, the wine you choose to accompany rock cod will be the polar opposite of what you’d choose to go with leg of lamb. However, within the broad “red” and “white” categories of meat, fish, and poultry, there are many shades of pink. For example, some fish are strongly fishy (sturgeon, mackerel, anchovies, and bluefish), while others are mild (rock cod, halibut, sole, and trout).\n\nRed meat can be strong, like lamb, or mild, like a filet of beef. White meat (pork and veal) is very different from red meat in personality, often acting more like chicken, semineutral in character and much influenced by the supporting cast of ingredients. Poultry also may vary from mild (chicken) to pungent (squab). Then there are other categories, such as offal (sweetbreads, liver, and so on), vegetables, grains, and legumes. So it really is more complicated than choosing a red wine for dinner because you’re having meat.\n\nA handful of very useful ingredients can inform—and hedge—your wine and food pairings. Often referred to as “bridge ingredients” or “wine links,” these allow you to play Merlin in the kitchen. See the table on page 22 for a list of “magic” ingredients and their effects.\n\n### Key 2. Cooking Methods\nAlthough the selection of ingredients is important, it’s only one element of the overall plan. And while it’s true that the primary ingredient in the food may determine the wine selection, just as often it is the cooking method that will be the critical factor."

The content can be divided into two primary sections:\n\n### Personal Experience with Apples\n- The author recounts how sampling different apples from a greenmarket and various growers in the United States and England has broadened their understanding and appreciation of apple varieties.\n- The experience underscores that apples' qualities vary significantly based on their origin, growing conditions, and type. This variation influences their suitability for fresh eating or juice production.\n\n### Evaluating Apple Juice as a Commodity\n- Apple juice is critiqued for its commoditized nature, as a product that is primarily made from apples not deemed suitable for fresh consumption.\n- The production process typically involves clarification, pasteurization, concentration, reconstitution, and blending, which can dilute the unique characteristics of the original apple variety.\n- The author advises against using commercial apple juice in cocktails, contrasting it unfavorably with artisanal or single-variety juices and ciders, which often retain more of the apple's original flavor profile. These preferred types are usually available at specialty stores and farmers' markets, but they are almost always unpasteurized, which affects their shelf-life and availability.\n- Pasteurization is critiqued for damaging the subtle flavors of apple juice, with most commercial juices being also faulted for their unnatural colors due to being overheated, which leads to oxidation that significantly alters taste.\n\nThis informative document highlights the complexities of apple juice production and its impacts on quality, especially relevant for enthusiasts interested in culinary applications, such as cocktail making."

Here are the key points presented in the document:\n\n1. **Psychological Influence of Sound on Flavor**: The document discusses findings by Oxford University professor Charles Spence, who conducted research showing that sounds can alter how food tastes. For instance, a potato chip tastes different when it sounds noisier during consumption; similarly, the sound of a Champagne bottle being opened (the pop) or its fizz enhances the drinking experience.\n\n2. **Influence of Background Noise**: Beyond the direct sounds associated with the food or drink itself, ambient sounds also have an impact; for example, bacon may taste more bacony if the sound of it sizzling is heard, and eggs taste more egg-like when the sound of chickens is nearby.\n\n3. **Champagne Production**: The document transitions from the sensory experiences elicited by sounds to how these experiences play into the complexities of Champagne production. It describes how producers maintain a stock of reserve wines from previous years, blending them with current production to ensure flavor consistency over the years and improve the wine's depth and complexity.\n\n4. **The Art of Blending**: The art of blending Champagne is emphasized. After harvest, wine-makers blend dozens of base wines (from different vintages) to create a house's nonvintage Champagne, referred to as the \"assemblage.\" This blending is cited as a high form of skill and art within the region.\n\n5. **Special Lots for Exceptional Vintages**: During particularly good years, certain lots of wine are earmarked for making a house's vintage Champagne or for creating a prestige cuvée — the most expensive and often top-tier offering of a house, illustrating the nuanced selections and strategies involved in Champagne production.\n\nOverall, the document connects the sensory perception of taste influenced by sound to the sophisticated and strategic production of Champagne, highlighting nuances in both sensory and production processes that contribute to the beverage's final quality."

Yet microscopic molds are inevitably present on much of our food, and certain molds have long traditions of use by people who grow them on foods as a means of processing. In the West, the most familiar mold ferments are cheeses, though molded cheeses do not seem to hold universal appeal. \"Most Westerners still have a deep-seated prejudice against moldy products, and they generally associate the word 'mold' with food spoilage, as in 'moldy bread,'\" observe William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi.^1\n\nIn Asia, molds are used much more widely and have greater acceptance. \"The word 'mold' there has a rather positive connotation, something like 'yeast' in the West,\" write Shurtleff and Aoyagi. Mixed cultures including yeasts and bacteria but typically dominated by molds, grown on grains—transliterated from Chinese [麴] as chhü (or qu or jiuqu or da qu)—have been used in Asia for thousands of years. \"There is no exact English equivalent for qu,\" writes H. T. Huang.\n\nIt has been translated variously as barm, leaven, yeast, and starter. None is entirely satisfactory but ferment is probably the best we can do since chhü contains both enzymes and live organisms. During incubation the enzymes hydrolyse the starch from the grain, the spores germinate, and the myceliae proliferate to produce more amylases. The yeasts grow in number and ferment the sugars generated in situ [in place] to alcohol. The procedure has been called Amylomyces, or simply Amylo."

Looking at the data by gender, interestingly, 35 percent of women are supertasters while just 10 percent of men are. Supertaster abilities are also more common in Asians and in African Americans than in Caucasians. To determine if a person is a nontaster, taster, or supertaster, researchers give the subject a small taste of the nontoxic compounds 6-n-propylthiouracil (known as PROP) or phenyl thiocarbamate (known as PTC).\n\n**Supertasters experience this compound as so bitter they want to gag,** while tasters detect a faint whisper of bitterness and nontasters experience no taste sensation at all. Finally, but importantly, the term supertaster sounds thoroughly desirable (who doesn't want to be super at most things?)—but it is not. Supertasters live in a neon taste world where many flavor impressions are just too intense to enjoy. According to Dr. Hildegard Heymann, professor and enologist in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, supertasters usually dislike the taste of broccoli, spinach, cabbage, and sprouts; hot curry and chili; grapefruit and lemon; cigarettes; coffee; and (oh no) alcohol.

    "contenu": "# Cork: A Future or Farewell?\n\nIn a technologically advanced civilization, sealing wine with a hunk of bark may seem hopelessly archaic. Indeed, cork has a growing number of critics. Yet the promising thwock as a cork leaves a bottle, a familiar sound for centuries, may continue to be heard for decades to come—at least with some expensive wines.\n\nCork, the bark of the cork oak tree (*Quercus suber*), is native to the poor, rocky soil of southern Portugal and Spain, as well as Sardinia, Algeria, Tunisia, Italy, and Morocco. Most top-quality corks used today come from Portuguese trees.\n\nCork's structural composition is remarkable. A cubic centimeter of cork contains roughly 40 million fourteen-sided cells arranged in rows and filled with a mixture of gases similar to oxygen. With a specific gravity of 0.25, it is four times lighter than water, yet highly elastic, capable of snapping back to its original shape after withstanding 14,000 pounds of pressure per cubic inch. Cork is impervious to air, almost impermeable by water, difficult to burn, resistant to temperature changes and vibrations, does not rot, and has the ability to mold itself to the contour of the container it is put into (such as the neck of a wine bottle).\n\nA cork tree is harvested, or stripped, for the first time when it is twenty-five years old, and thereafter once every nine years. Although stripping does no permanent damage, the tree will need two years or more to recover its vitality. A cork tree will be stripped, on average, sixteen times in its 150 to 200 years of life.\n\nThe stripping itself is grueling work. Using special wedge-shaped axes, workers peel four-foot planks from the bark during the intense summer heat when the tree's sap is circulating, making it possible to pry the bark off. Once the bark is stripped off, it is stored in rooms with concrete floors (not on the ground, where it could be contaminated by soil) and left to season and dry for several months. The bark is then boiled or steamed to improve its elasticity and flatten it, and then dried again and left in a dark cellar to dry out for three to four weeks. Finally, the bark is trimmed into rectangular planks and separated according to quality and thickness. Wine corks are shaped from the planks, graded, and washed in a mild hydrogen peroxide solution to remove dust, sanitize them, and lighten their color.\n\nBefore the mid-1990s, most corks were washed in a chlorine solution. Chlorine, alas, can react with moisture and fungi inside the cork to facilitate the growth of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) and related compounds, chemicals responsible for the “wet dog sitting on damp newspapers in a dank cellar” aroma wine can pick up from corks. A wine tainted with TCA is said to be “corked” (see page 113). Although chlorine is no longer used in cleaning corks, the problem of corked wines has not gone away, in part because wineries use water to clean barrels and equipment, and municipal water contains chlorine. Indeed, the average incidence of corked wine is now estimated at 2.5 percent. TCA can also be generated by other means. Sometimes the compound exists naturally in raw cork bark. But it has also been found in soil, inside barrels, on cardboard boxes, on wooden pallets, even just in the air—and from there, it can contaminate corks, which in turn taint the wine.\n\nToday, cork’s future is anything but clear. While the Portuguese government has taken measures to encourage improvements in cork manufacture and cork oak tree reforestation, wine producers around the world appear to be increasingly fed up with the cost and loss of reputation associated with tainted bottles. In response to the problem, a modern screw-cap initiative began in the Clare Valley of Australia as far back as 2000, with New Zealand soon following. (Wines with screw caps do not get tainted by TCA.) Today, about 45 percent of all Australian wine is stoppered by screw cap, as is 85 percent of all New Zealand wine. Worldwide, the number of wine bottles with screw caps continues to grow."

Here's a structured representation of the content in the document:\n\n### Combos with Peas and Other Ingredients\n1. **Pois & Fruits de mer**: Peas with seafood.\n2. **Pois & Jambon cru**: Peas with cured ham.\n3. **Pois & Lard**: Peas with bacon.\n4. **Pois & Menthe**: Peas with mint.\n5. **Pois & Œuf**: Peas with egg.\n\n### Detailed Descriptions of Dishes\n- **Pois & Oignons**: This dish consists of pre-cooked peas mixed with pan-fried onions (including the bulbs of three young onions, sautéed in 30g of butter with a generous handful of chopped chive leaves), and sugar pod halves or quartered brown sugar cubes. It is simmered with 100ml water broth, salt, tablespoon of sugar and finished with 450g of fresh peas. It's cooked for about 10 minutes and seasoned before serving with fresh butter.\n\n- **Pois & Panais**: Peas with parsnips.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson blanc**: A dish called surf 'n’ turf combining seafood and white meat with peas being a core ingredient. It's popular in British pubs and American grills, with an emphasis on the fresh, garden-picked quality of peas. The dish typically accompanies fish such as turbot, and meats like pork belly, often served with ingredients like aioli or parsley, aiming to enhance the salty flavor of the fish with sweetness from the peas.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson fumé**: Smoked fish with peas.\n\n- **Pois & Poisson gras**: a traditional dish from New England featuring heavily in the celebrations like Patriot's Day and Independence Day; made with fattier fish varieties and served with new potatoes. This dish is generally served as part of a strawberry shortcake which resembles the look of a French Fraisier cake.\n\n- **Pois & Pomme de terre**: Peas with potatoes.\n\n- **Pois & Porc**: Peas with pork, described as harmoniously paired like a well-matched outfit, citing a famous example from the 1850 Oxford English Dictionary. The dish uses heritage breeds of pork and peas and highlights traditional English cooking styles with additional ingredients like sage, thyme, or parsley and sometimes chestnuts or truffle in contemporary presentations.\n\n- **Pois & Poulet**: Chicken with peas. The dish emphasizes a simple pairing which, when executed well, like mixing roast chicken with a clamart (peas cooked with seasoned stock), offers a palatable and unpretentious food experience.\n\nThe document describes traditional combinations, cooking methods, and cultural significance of dishes that combine peas with various other food items, highlighting both traditional British and American culinary practices."

Here’s a structured summary:\n\n### Nitrate and Nitrite in Meat Curing\n- **Functional Contribution**:\n  - Nitrite gives cured meat its bright pink-red color and flavors by interacting with the meat's iron content and preventing the oxidation.\n  - It also inhibits the growth of bacteria including Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium responsible for botulism.\n- **Health Concerns**:\n  - Combination with other food components may form potential carcinogens called nitrosamines.\n  - Residual nitrate and nitrite levels in cured meats in the United States are generally low, usually well below 0.02%.\n  \n### Sublime Hams\n- **Transformation Process**:\n  - The extended periods of curing transform the texture and flavor of hams, making them standout culinary delicacies.\n\n### The Effects of Salt in Meat Curing\n- **Mechanism**:\n  - High salt concentrations enhance the meat's appearance and texture by causing the muscle cells' protein filaments to separate and become translucent, resulting in a tender texture.\n  \n### Hams Cured without Nitrite\n- **Special Cases**:\n  - Some traditional hams, like those from Parma and Daniele, are cured only with sea salt, avoiding nitrites yet still achieving a desirable color and flavor.\n  - The unique flavors and textures in these nitrite-free hams might be due to the action of specific ripening bacteria and the natural breakdown of fats.\n\nThis section does not only discuss the process but also contemplates on the various effects, both beneficial and potentially harmful, of the substances used in meat curing."

Dull and wrinkled skin indicates a less fresh fish.\n- **Mucous**: Fresh fish should have a transparent and glossy mucous. A milky appearance suggests degradation.\n- **Eyes**: Should be bright, black, and convex. Dull and gray appearance indicates age.\n- **Belly**: Intact without swelling or broken skin. Swelling suggests internal degradation.\n- **Cut Fish**: Fillets should be glossy, without surface drying.\n\n### Storing Fresh Fish and Shellfish: Refrigeration and Freezing\n- **Initial Care**: Good condition is crucial until consumption, focusing on averting spoilage caused by enzymes and bacteria that dull colors, flatten flavor, and soften textures.\n- **Microbial Influence**: Spoilage is mainly due to microbes like **Pseudomonas**. They speed decay similar to their effect on beef or pork.\n- **Chemical Byproducts**: Spoilage leads to the formation of ammonia, dimethylamine, indole, skatole, putrescine, cadaverine, and other compounds.\n- **Preventative Measures**: Initial cleaning and rinsing are critical to ward off bacteria.\n\n### Shellfish That Glow in the Dark\n- **Bioluminescence**: Certain shellfish can glow due to bacteria like **Photobacterium** and **Vibrio**, which are usually harmless to humans but indicate the presence of bacteria in the seafood."

    "contenu": "### DESSERT WINES\n\nFor years I've noted sadly that, with a few exceptions (mostly avid sommelier types and pastry chefs), people don’t give dessert wines much thought. It’s their loss. Admittedly, many diners are sated by the time they reach the end of the meal, but those who always pass on dessert wines are missing out on many of the wine world’s greatest and most delectable offerings.\n\n#### STYLES OF WINE AND WINE-GROWING AREAS\n\nWhile styles of dessert wines differ by grape, from country to country, and regionally, virtually all wine-growing areas make and adore their sticky wines! Style makes for an easier breakdown than geography or varietal, so in this last wine journey I cut loose from the template.\n\nAlmost all the great dessert wines are products of accident. Nobody, at the time most of these wines were born, made a conscious effort to define or produce distinguished sweet wines. They just happened.\n\n#### LATE-HARVEST WINES\n\nThe best-known category of stickies is late-harvest wines. As the descriptor implies, the grapes are picked late in the season. Wine producers of the past, farmers who simply grew grapes and made their own wine, did not have access to all the equipment, charts, and tools we utilize today to judge when to pick the grapes. As a result, some grapes were picked later than intended, and they were made into wines mostly so as not to waste the fruit. Late-harvested grapes—some of them left so long that they have begun to shrivel and turn to raisins on the vine—have higher levels of sugar. During fermentation, the yeast dies when the alcohol level in the wine reaches 18 to 19 percent. Simply stated, then, with very sweet grapes, fermentation stops before all the sugar has been consumed, and the residual sugar results in a sweet wine.\n\nIn the past, though initially delicious, many of these sweet wines would spoil rapidly or even re-ferment. Today, once a dessert wine is made, it is stabilized to enhance its keeping qualities."

Below is a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Transformation of Atole:**\n   - **Background**: Historically, the Aztecs allowed atole, a traditional drink made from maize, to sour over several days until it developed an agreeable sourness, transforming into xococatolli.\n   - **Methods**: \n     - Soaking hard, ripe maize without lime and allowing it to dissolve, followed by souring before boiling.\n     - A second method involves soaking, grinding, and then souring the maize before boiling. A recipe is mentioned where maize dough is divided, partially boiled, left to stand overnight, and boiled again the next day.\n\n2. **Xococatolli:**\n   - In Spanish, xococatolli is referred to as atole agrio (sour atole).\n\n3. **Huitlacoche:**\n   - Described as a microbial transformation of corn, huitlacoche (Ustilago maydis) is a fungus growing on corn, also known in English as corn smut.\n   - **Cultural Significance**: Esteemed for its unique flavor, it is so appreciated in Aztec and later Mexican cuisine that it is sometimes deliberately introduced into crops.\n\n4. **Corn-based Fermented Beverages:**\n   - **Tesguiño:**\n     - Popular among the Huichol and Tarahumar peoples of Mexico.\n     - Made by malting corn, grinding it to a paste, simmering with water, and adding botanical catalysts for fermenting into a type of beer.\n     - Further exploration on Tesguiño in chapter 9 is suggested.\n   - **Sendecho:**\n     - Also made from malted corn fermented with hot chili peppers, known among the Mazahua people of central Mexico.\n\nEach point relates to different aspects of traditional maize cultivation and culinary practices in Mexico, reflecting both historical contexts and modern appreciation of these methods and flavors."

Chewing a mint leaf after pressing it against the mouth's roof demonstrates the low effort required for flavor extraction.\n- **Gentle Technique**: The process involves gently pressing and twisting the muddler in the shaker to avoid releasing bitter flavors.\n- **Additives**: Sweeteners are often added first to the shaker before the herbs to aid in the muddling process.\n- **Citrus and Fruit Muddling**: When muddling involves citrus or fruit, the pressure is slightly increased to help release oils or juices effectively. It's beneficial to visually inspect inside the shaker during muddling.\n- **Combination Muddling**: For cocktails requiring both fruit and herbs, the sweetener and herb go into the shaker first, followed by the fruit. This prevents the herbs from tearing.\n\n---\n\n### Rimming\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Preparation**: Before straining the cocktail into the serving glass, the rim of the glass is moistened, usually with water or a citrus fruit matching the drink’s flavor.\n- **Application**: Once moist, the rim is dipped into a chosen rimming mixture (like salt or sugar).\n- **Technique**: The glass should be rolled from the outside to keep the drink free of any particles from the rimming mixture.\n\n---\n\nThis specific document includes detailed instructions for two essential cocktail preparation techniques aimed at enhancing the flavor and presentation of cocktails."

    "contenu": "The text provided discusses various aspects of Australian wine, focusing primarily on sparkling wines and the different varietals of red wine such as sémillon, cabernet sauvignon, and blends involving shiraz. Here's a structured summary of the information from the text:\n\n### BUBBLES AND THE BARBIE\n- **Sparkling Wines**: Primarily made from pinot noir and chardonnay, Australian sparkling wines are less complex than Champagne but are prominently fruity and fresh. Moët & Chandon is mentioned as a notable Champagne house affecting Australian production.\n- **First Sparklers**: Originated in the 1840s, with leading producers like Seppelt, known for balancing the tannin with higher sugar content in their sparkling wines.\n\n### Australian Sémillon\n- **Aging Characteristics**: With aging, sémillon takes on flavors of honey, brioche, and roasted cashew, offering a rich, lanolin-like texture. Exceptional old sémillons from Tyrell’s (notably Tyrell’s Vat 1) and others like Hart & Hunter, Vasse Felix, Rothbury Estate, Thomas Wines, and Tim Adams are highlighted.\n\n### CABERNET SAUVIGNON\n- **Significance in Australia**: Considered by many as Australia's elite red grape, despite the popularity of shiraz.\n- **Historical Roots**: First planted in the mid-19th century. Kalimna Vineyard in the Barossa Valley holds some of the oldest cabernet sauvignon vines in the world.\n- **Characteristics and Producers**: Notable for complexity and depth, with top wines like those from Henschke’s Cyril Henschke, Wendouree, Penfolds Bin 707 featuring structured tannins and concentrated flavors.\n- **Regional Variations**: Emphasized from regions known for specific soil types like Coonawarra and the Margaret River region.\n- **Blends**: Cabernet is often blended with shiraz, enhancing its structure and adding a rich fruit core. Examples include Yalumba’s Signature Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz and Penfolds Bin 389 Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz.\n\nThis structured overview encapsulates the key points around the varietals, taste profiles, and significant wines and vineyards from the original text."
