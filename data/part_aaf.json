Below is a breakdown of its content structured by key points:\n\n### Vitamin C and Fermented Vegetables\n\n1. **Historical Background:**\n   - Fermenting vegetables became a widespread practice in temperate regions historically because there were no fresh vegetables available in winter.\n   - The primary aim was to extend the season and preserve vegetables for winter consumption.\n\n2. **Nutritional Benefits:**\n   - Vegetables are a source of several critical nutrients, especially vitamin C.\n   - Fermentation helps in maintaining a balanced winter diet.\n   - Notable historical reference: Confucius in the 6th century BC mentioned surviving winter by consuming fermented vegetables (\"yan-tsai\").\n   - The British sailor Captain James Cook used sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), rich in Vitamin C, to combat scurvy among his crew during voyages.\n\n3. **Fermentation and Vitamin C:**\n   - The fermentation process itself does not boost vitamin C levels but helps in slowing down its loss.\n   - Reference to a 1938 study by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station which indicated that the primary loss of Vitamin C occurs post-fermentation, mainly due to the reduction of the protective carbon dioxide layer formed during fermentation.\n\n4. **Long-Term Preservation:**\n   - While fermentation does not permanently preserve all nutrients, it significantly extends their longevity, making it a valuable preservation method.\n\n### Kraut-Chi Basics\n\n- **Introduction to Kraut-Chi:**\n  - The term \"Kraut-chi\" is described as a coined term by the author, representing a hybrid of sauerkraut and kimchi.\n\nThis document emphasizes the utility of fermentation in historical and nutritional contexts, particularly with regards to maintaining essential nutrients like Vitamin C in diets during months when fresh produce is unavailable."

    "source": "_Origins_of_French_Wine_Culture__From_Italian_Etru",
    "contenu": "## French Wine Culture Began in (Mon Dieu) . . . Italy\n\nThe French may have been the undisputed masters of the art of winemaking for the past thousand years, but they learned it from the Italians. Indeed, startling research reported in 2013 suggests that French wine culture began about 600 B.C. when the Etruscans, a pre-Roman civilization based in central Italy, began shipping wine to southern France, and establishing a market for the beverage. The entrepreneurial French soon initiated their own winemaking industry by importing Etruscan grapevines and emulating Etruscan winemaking techniques (including mixing wine with bithyme, rosemary, and other herbs). For their part, the Etruscans learned about wine sometime around 800 B.C., from the Phoenicians (based in what is modern-day Lebanon), who themselves had learned how to grow vines and make wine from tribes in the area that, today, is Turkey. These tribes were the first to domesticate grapevines, more than eight thousand years ago.\n\nThe research team that made the discovery was headed by Dr. Patrick McGovern, Director of Biomolecular Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and the study was reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the research, excavations at the ancient port site of Lattara (near Montpellier) in southern France unearthed well-preserved Etruscan amphorae, vessels used to transport wine and other goods in the ancient Mediterranean world. Using extremely sensitive chemical analytics, the scientists revealed that the amphorae contained the residues of wine, herbs, and pine resin (which was used to preserve wine during long journeys). Even more amazing was the discovery of an ancient limestone platform covered in wine residue—thought to be among the first French wine presses.\n\n### French Wine Varieties\n\nAbout 90 percent of French wine is based on thirty-six grapes. The wines made from these varieties run the full gamut from dry to sweet and from still to sparkling. And in addition to wine, of course, two of the world’s most famous grape-based spirits are French: Armagnac and Cognac (see pages 313 and 318, respectively).\n\nDespite the worldwide prestige of several French white wines, the French themselves tend to drink red wine. Copious amounts of rosé are tossed down, too, especially in summer. Indeed, more rosé is consumed (27 percent of all wine) than white wine (16 percent of all wine).\n\n### Global Presence of French Wine\n\nUnlike the wines of most other European countries, French wine is known in virtually every corner of the globe. A thirsty traveler in Fiji, Nairobi, or Taipei can easily hunt down a bottle of Champagne, even when all other wine possibilities seem exhausted. Of course, the quality of French wine accounts for a good measure of its appeal, but so do various historic and geographic considerations. France was the first European country to develop significant international trade for its wines. This was possible thanks to the proximity of most French wine regions to large, navigable rivers. As early as the twelfth century, Bordeaux wines were being shipped down the massive Gironde Estuary and out to sea, headed for England and Scotland."

Here's a structured summary:\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Fermentation Basics**:\n   - Fermentation of vegetables generally relies on bacteria naturally present on the vegetables themselves.\n   - Special cultures are not necessary for fermentation, but many choose to use selected strains or concentrated populations of lactic acid bacteria to influence the fermentation process.\n\n2. **Use of Starter Cultures**:\n   - Additions such as laboratory-bred bacterial strains, sauerkraut juice, brine, kombucha, kefir, or whey act as starters to possibly speed up or control the fermentation better.\n\n3. **Historical and Research Background**:\n   - The use of starter cultures in vegetables has been studied for nearly a century.\n   - Research predominantly indicates that starter cultures are \"impractical and unnecessary\" as long as natural conditions for fermentation (like proper temperature and salt concentration) are met.\n   - Typical suitable conditions noted in research include about 2% salt concentration and a temperature around 65°F/18°C.\n\n4. **Effects of Low Salt Concentrations**:\n   - Low salt concentrations in ferments can lead to variability, including unpredictable textural changes and off-flavors.\n   - A specific study cited from the \"Journal of Food Science\" in 2007 highlights that fermenting with 50% less salt led to these issues, though the use of L. mesenteroides as a starter culture can counteract these effects, stabilizing the fermentation quality.\n\n5. **Focus of Improvements**:\n   - The concerns with low-salt fermentations mainly relate to texture and flavor rather than safety.\n   - Adjusting the fermentation time can compensate for lower salt levels.\n\nThis structured overview encapsulates the main points covered in the document regarding the role and efficacy of starter cultures in fermenting vegetables, grounded in historical and recent research findings."

This prompts the question: how does one navigate this environment effectively?\n\n### Initial Approach\n1. **Stay Calm:** Encounter with numerous unfamiliar wines can be overwhelming, but remember that even wine professionals might not recognize every label.\n2. **Observe Organization:** Upon entering, take a moment to understand the arrangement of the store. Is it organized by country, varietal, price point, or style?\n3. **Take Notes:** As you explore and see potential wines of interest, jot down notes to help remember your thoughts as you might forget which bottles stood out by the time you reach the end of your visit.\n\n### Key Shopping Tips\n- **Budgeting:** Determine your spending limit before you shop. Plan to allocate a reasonable amount per bottle that suits your financial comfort level without feeling compelled to overspend.\n\n### Additional Information About Madeline Triffon\n- Madeline Triffon serves as the Director of Wine for the Matt Prentice Restaurant Group, based in Detroit.\n- She became one of the only two female master sommeliers in the world in 1987, and subsequently the eighth American to achieve this rank.\n- She actively mentors the next generation of sommeliers and serves on the board of the American Chapter of the Court of Master Sommeliers.\n- Her influence and expertise in the wine industry have been recognized with numerous awards. Sante magazine awarded her the title of Wine and Spirits Professional of the Year in 1999. She also received the “Women Who Inspire Award” from Women Chefs and Restauranteurs (WCR)."

You cannot think of the region simply in terms of pinot noir and chardonnay, for in the most elemental sense, Burgundy is not about pinot noir and chardonnay. Pinot noir and chardonnay are merely the voices through which the message of a site is expressed. Indeed, it’s important to remember that there is no exact word in French for winemaker. In Burgundy, the term most often used is *vigneron*, which means “vine grower.”\n\nTo some, this distinction might seem awfully precious. Yet terroir—and, in Burgundy, the incredible specificity of terroir—cannot be easily dismissed or avoided. Taste two wines from the same domaine and you may find enormous differences between them. How can these be explained when both wines were made by the same person, in the same exact manner, from the same variety of grapes grown in the same way? The clearly apparent variable, and the factor that reasonably seems responsible for those differences, is place."

They have more juice to them as well as complexity. Almonds go with cherries. Dark chocolate actually goes better with cherries than it does raspberries, and white chocolate works with cherries as well.\"\n   - **Key Ingredients**: Cherries, sweet vermouth, vanilla\n\n2. **Michael Laiskonis from Le Bernardin, New York City**\n   - **Quote**: \"If you have perfect ingredients in the summertime, you don’t have to do much to them. With our perfect cherries [Michign, white at Tributé restaurant], we halved them, sprinkled them with sugar, and heated them with a blowtorch so that they were just warmed through. The slightly caramelized sugar made a huge difference in the flavor. I used a goat cream cheese worked to texture similar to mascarpone cheese, which I shaped into quenelles. Served alongside were some ice wine vinegar caramel sauce and a crispy crepe. Before serving, I added individual thyme leaves and a crack of black pepper. These are all really classic flavors, especially the cheese with black pepper and cherries.\"\n   - **Recipe Elements**: Halved cherries heated with sugar, goat cream cheese, ice wine vinegar caramel sauce, crispy crepe, thyme, black pepper\n\n3. **Andrew Carmellini from A Voce, New York City**\n   - **Quote**: \"I was reading an old Fannie Farmer cookbook from the late 1800s about making cherry jam. In the recipe, they would take the cherry pits and crush them. I thought it was crazy but tried it. When you take cherry pits and crush them, it gives you an almond flavor. I made some pickled sour cherries with the crushed pits in cheesecloth with the pickling liquid and I got this great almondy flavor that went deep inside the cherries.\"\n   - **Recipe Creation**: Pickled sour cherries with crushed cherry pits in cheesecloth, enhancing the almond flavor within\n\nEach excerpt discusses a different method of enhancing cherries' natural flavors and textures, demonstrating unique culinary techniques and pairings."

CANADIANS DRINK AN AVERAGE OF 4 GALLONS (15 LITERS) OF WINE PER PERSON PER YEAR.**\n\nCanada is one of the newest wine regions in the New World. And like its southern neighbor, the United States, the country possesses a pioneering spirit thanks to its early days as a vast wilderness. Today, from seemingly out of nowhere, an exciting wine industry has sprung, and the top Canadian wines—dry and sweet—are now turning heads in competitions internationally. Though the industry is small, in the ten years between 2003 and 2013, the number of wineries here quadrupled. Today, there is no doubt that the wine industry in Canada is on a roll and that many distinctive, exciting dry wines are being made. As for Canada’s renowned, sweet icewines—prepare to be devastated by their deliciousness.\n\n![As the harvested grapes arrive, winemakers at Malivoire Winery in Ontario sort out any that aren’t perfect.](image-url)\n\nMany Americans, and, indeed, many Canadians, may never have tasted a Canadian wine (the modern industry is still in its infancy), but grape-growing actually began here in the 1860s, when grapes intended for sacramental wine were planted near the Okanagan Mission in British Columbia, as well as on Lake Erie’s Pelee Island, at a winery with what, at the time, was the evocative name Vin Villa. Yet for more than a century, the development of a prosperous wine industry was hampered by a complex series of political and economic barriers, including the creation of government monopolies that controlled the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that a modern wine industry finally took hold."

    "contenu": "Here's the structured content of the document in plain text:\n\n**PUMPING OVER**: A process during the FERMENTATION of red wine in which the juice is pumped from the bottom of the container to the top and then sprayed over the cap of skins to break it up and keep it wet. This prevents undesirable bacteria from spoiling the wine or creating off flavors.\n\n**PUNCHEON**: Modern puncheons, commonly used for wines like sangiovese, come in two sizes: 79.25 gallons and 132.08 gallons (200 and 500 liters, respectively).\n\n**PUNCHING DOWN**: A process similar to PUMPING OVER used to accomplish the same goals. During this process, the cap is gently pressed down with a paddle into the fermenting grape juice.\n\n**PUNT**: A feature in the bottom of most wine bottles, typically shallow or absent in Champagne bottles, meant to strengthen the glass at its weakest point.\n\n**PYRAZINES**: Compounds found in certain wines giving them a bell pepper flavor, especially high in unripe cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, merlot, and cabernet franc.\n\n**QVEVRI**: A large earthenware vessel used traditionally in Georgia around 6000 B.C. for fermenting and storing wine, buried in the ground to control temperature.\n\n**RACKING**: A wine clarification method involving siphoning off solids and particulate matter, then aerating the wine by pouring it into a clean barrel.\n\n**RAISINY**: Describes wines that taste slightly like raisins due to overripe grapes, which can add nuance but may be seen as a flaw if overdone.\n\n**RESERVE**: Refers to wines made as a higher quality, often aged longer before release. The term 'reserve' has no legal definition except in Washington State, where it implies higher quality. The designation varies greatly internationally.\n\n**RESIDUAL SUGAR**: Natural sugars remaining in wine post-fermentation, giving it a sweet taste as not all sugar is converted into alcohol.\n\n**RIDDLING**: A process during the production of sparkling wine where sediment is consolidated in the bottle's neck for removal.\n\n**ROOTSTOCK**: The part of a grapevine planted in the soil, varying in disease and climate tolerance, influencing the vine's growth rate and suitability to different soils.\n\nThis content summarizes key winemaking terms and processes, providing insights into traditional and modern practices in the industry."

Bring to a boil and simmer until reduced by half, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Season with additional ginger if desired. Whisk in the butter if using, before serving. This sauce can be prepared up to 5 days ahead, but add butter just before serving. Cover and refrigerate.\n\n2. **Prepare Fish:** Brush the salmon fillets lightly with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.\n\n3. **Cooking Method Options:**\n   - **Broil or Grill:** Preheat the broiler or prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Cook the salmon, turning once and basting with some of the sauce, until the fish appears opaque when a knife is inserted into its thickest part, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. You can opt for medium-rarity instead of well-done, based on preference.\n   - **Baking Alternative:** Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the fish in an oiled baking dish. Bake, basting once with the sauce, until the fish is almost opaque when a knife is inserted into the thickest part, usually 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n4. **Final Touch:** Bring the remaining sauce to a simmer (if cooled) and pour over the cooked salmon just before serving.\n\n### Note:\n- **Variation:** The salmon can be baked instead of broiled or grilled, following the instructions for the baking alternative.\n\nThis dish is ideally paired with oaky, smoky, ample pinot noirs as indicated by the recipe note. Enjoy a flavorful meal that highlights the rich blend of soy, ginger, and sake!"

There, in a warren of warehouses known as lodges, the wines would be blended and matured by the shippers. Today, most Port is still blended, aged, and bottled in the shippers’ warehouses, although the wine itself is brought down from the Douro by tanker trucks, a feat that hardly seems possible given the extremely narrow roads, hairpin turns, and general absence of shoulders on roads that, in some places, barely cling to the cliffs."

The white part can be cooked longer than the leaves: boil for about 20 minutes before adding the leaves, then continue to mince. Continue simmering for about ten minutes.\n\n### Recipe Idea\n- Focaccia with chard and goat cheese, p. 257 \n\nThe formatted steps correspond to the images, showing the sequential actions of preparing the chard: chopping, separating, rolling up, and slicing the stems."
