    "contenu": "The document contains detailed information about two different types of grape varieties used in wine-making: Garnacha and Grüner Veltliner.\n\n### Garnacha\n- **Origin**: Spanish name for \"Garnacha\" likely originated in Aragon, Spain, despite a hypothesis suggesting its initial origin in Italy.\n- **Characteristics**: This grape variety is known for its difficulty in growth and instable genetic nature. It tends to generate wine that is simple, fairly alcoholic, and in its best forms, presents unmistakable purity, richness, and beauty, often with flavors akin to cherry preserves.\n- **Tannin Level**: Garnacha is not particularly rich in tannins, leading to a sappy, luxurious texture.\n- **Blending**: Typically blended with other grape varieties such as Carignan, Syrah, and Mourvèdre, especially in its typical growing regions which include central and southern Spain, southern France, and central California.\n\n### Grüner Veltliner\n- **Origin**: Grüner veltliner became notably prominent as a top grape variety in Austria over a decade ago.\n- **Leading Variety**: It's the leading white wine of Austria and the main grape variety planted in the vineyards along the Danube river north and west of Vienna.\n- **Geographical Distribution**: Besides Austria, it's limitedly grown in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and other small areas in Eastern Europe.\n- **Genetic Heritage**: It is a natural cross of savagnin and a nearly extinct German variety, St. Georgener, and related to pinot noir.\n- **Characteristics**: Known for its lively, bold, dry, and mineral-rich profile with a signature aroma of white pepper and flavor hinting at green legumes. Similar to riesling, it is generally not blended with other grape varieties and rarely involves new oak.\n- **Acidity**: This grape has naturally high acidity, which contributes to its distinct mouthwatering quality and enhances its compatibility with food.\n\nOverall, the document discusses the history, cultivation, flavor profiles, and blending practices of these two distinctive grape varieties."

Here’s the structured breakdown:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n1. 1 tablespoon butter\n2. 2 tablespoons chopped shallots\n3. ¾ cup Riesling\n4. 1/3 cup shelled pistachios, toasted and salted\n5. ¼ cup chopped tarragon\n6. 24 pea shoots (or 12 baby spinach leaves)\n7. Whip 1/3 cup cream to firm peaks then refrigerate.\n\n**Preparation Method:**\n1. Blanch the peas in salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and shock in ice water. Drain and set aside.\n2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until translucent.\n3. Add Riesling, bring to a boil, and reduce by one-third.\n4. Add remaining cream and simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the peas and pistachios and bring to boil.\n5. Very gently fold in the whipped cream.\n6. Transfer the mixture to a heatproof serving dish. Gratinee (brown) under a preheated broiler—be cautious as this happens very quickly.\n7. Garnish with remaining herbs and greens.\n\n**Our Taste Notes:**\n- The licoricey floral notes from tarragon enhance the sweetness, while the Riesling accentuates the vegetable flavors, adding sweetness and tanginess that sharpens the palate.\n\nThe latter part of the document also briefly mentions \"May Ragout of Morels, Garden Shoots, and Greens,\" highlighting morels as an indicator that the cold weather is over, paired with early spring vegetables to welcome the warmer season.\n\nLastly, it notes the serving size for the ragout as serving 4 as an appetizer."

The steps to prepare citrus wedges are:\n1. **Cut the fruit in half lengthwise**, then make a crosswise notch across the center of each half from pith to pith to create a split for fitting the fruit on the rim of a glass later.\n2. **Quarter each half lengthwise** to make 4 wedges.\n3. **Slice away any membrane** from the straight edge of each wedge and pluck out any seeds with the tip of a knife.\n\n### CITRUS WHEELS, CRESCENTS, AND FANS\nCitrus wheels are aromatic garnishes that can be skewered or used in drinks. They can also be made into crescents rather than wheels. Here are the steps:\n1. **To make wheels**, working from the less-tapered end, cut the fruit into ¼-inch crosswise slices.\n2. **To make crescents**, cut the wheels in half, trimming any membrane from the straight edge and removing any seeds with the tip of a knife.\n3. **Citrus fans** involve a wheel or crescent skewered on a cocktail pick.\n\n### CITRUS FLAGS\nCitrus wheels and crescents are sometimes used as flags, commonly wrapped around cherries or other fruits.\n\nThe document also includes two illustrations depicting a citrus wheel and a citrus fan, which provide visual guidance on the appearance of these garnishes."

They generally do not require the use of fuel and are associated with island and coastal areas.\n  - There is a food safety concern with raw fish due to microbe and parasite risks. The freshest and highest quality fish should be selected for raw consumption to prevent food poisoning.\n\n- **Sushi and Sashimi:**\n  - Common forms of raw fish dishes, primarily popular in Japan. The original preparation, *narezushi*, has evolved into sushi which means \"salted\".\n  - Sushi preparation involves strict hygiene practices to prevent contamination, including using chlorinated bleach for cleaning.\n\n#### Specific Dishes and Preparations\n- **Tart Ceviche and Kinilaw:**\n  - *Ceviche*: Thought to originate from South America featuring fish “cooked” in citrus juice and spices.\n  - *Kinilaw*: A Filipino version, using vinegar or a sour juice for marination.\n\n- **Salty Poke and Lomi:**\n  - Hawaiian dishes where fish is diced and then massaged or \"rubbed\" (Lomi), or sliced and salted for varying periods (Poke).\n\n#### Food Safety\n- **Freezing and Temperature Guidelines:**\n  - Fish intended for raw consumption should ideally be frozen at -31ºF to -35ºC for at least 15 hours or stored at -4ºF to -20ºC for seven days. This is particularly crucial for tuna species intended for sushi and sashimi to reduce parasite risks.\n\n---\n\nThis layout captures the core content of each section dealing with specific preparation techniques, cultural insights, and important safety guidelines regarding the consumption of raw fish and shellfish."

Examples include fish wrapped in grape leaf, prawns with garlic butter, and brochette of prawns with garlic butter.\n- **Meat and Poultry:** Best paired with dishes such as whole chicken roasted and stuffed with lemon and onion hearts, or a roast chicken that can stand up to many rich preparations like leek and goat cheese quiche or mixed vegetable frittata.\n- **Vegetarian Options:** Suitable for dishes with a base of pasta or risotto, especially when featuring crab, pesto, mozzarella, pine nuts, olive oil, and basil.\n- **Dessert Pairing:** Complements simple cakes like almond or vanilla pound cake and fruit-based desserts.\n\n**Pairing Pointers:**\n- **Shellfish:** Most treatments of shellfish, especially crab, are enhanced by Garganega. Examples include Maryland crab cakes or Dungeness crab with basil aioli.\n- **Avoid:** Heavily oaked examples do not pair well with the lighter treatments of scallops or sauces that have a butter base.\n- **Meat Pairings:** Simple preparations of fish, poultry, and white meat are recommended. Suggested are roast loin of pork, swordfish, or poached or lightly sautéed chicken, especially when served with risotto or pasta scented with lemon zest.\n\n---\nThis structure presents a comprehensive guide to enjoying Garganega wine, illustrating its flexibility across a range of dishes and preparation styles."

Yet this is arguably one of the world’s top spots for sauvignon blanc, as well as Austria’s most beautiful wine region. Behind the small houses with their lace curtains and flower boxes, the vineyards stretch over kelly-green hills. Many vineyards have a *klapotez*—a wooden windmill with hammers that make a loud clacking noise to scare off the birds (who, unfooled, sometimes sit right on top of the contraption).\n  \nEverywhere in Styria there are pumpkin patches, for this is the home of Austria’s famous specialty, pumpkinseed oil. Made from the roasted seeds of a special green-and-yellow striped pumpkin, the dark green oil is mind-blowingly delicious (see page 598).\n\nAs for Styrian wines, the best (almost all of them white because of the alpine climate) can be dazzling, with bright, focused flavors that have a keen, kinetic edge to them. Most of the top wines are found along the wine route (*weinstrasse*) in the hilly province of south Styria, Südsteiermark, where the lemon-yellow daylight is so vivid it almost seems polished. Vineyards here are among the steepest in the country, and the soils are varied—from slate, marl, and limestone, to gneiss, schist, basalt, sand, and loam.\n\nChardonnay (called morillon in Styria) has a long history here, the vines having been brought from the Champagne region of France in the nineteenth century. For the most part, Styrian chardonnay is made in the style of French Chablis—taut and linear rather than fat and buttery. But the biggest surprise—and Austria’s best-kept secret—is Styrian sauvignon blanc. These are racy, herbal, lemony wines, with a wild outdoorsy quality and a tanginess not unlike a good French Sancerre. In addition to sauvignon blanc and morillon, the varieties of note include welschriesling, weissburgunder, traminer, and beautifully taut, dry, refreshing muskateller (aka gelber muskateller), the Austrian name for muscat blanc à petits grains, the best of the extensive group of wines with muscat in their names.\n\n**Note**: For more details on pumpkinseed oil, refer to page 598."

The slide (labelled as \"Diapo 51\") includes a picturesque photograph of a chateau, which is likely one of the estates where this type of wine is produced.\n\nFrom what is visible in the slide, there are no tables or extensive textual details presented, just the designation of this particular wine genre (Sweet Bordeaux) under the broader category of Bordeaux wines. The course or presentation may elaborate further on the characteristics, production, and varieties within the Sweet Bordeaux family in subsequent or previous slides."

    "contenu": "This document discusses the impactful flavors and foundation elements of cooking, referring to aged and organic ingredients and their effect on taste as well as the conceptual framework of \"tast platforms\". Here's a structured breakdown of the content:\n\n---\n\n### Funky Ingredients and Their Impact on Flavor\n\n- **Description**: The text describes ingredients that may be seen as less appealing (\"stinky\" or \"funky\") but highlights their potential in cooking due to their strong, unique flavors.\n- **Examples Provided**: Aged truffles and gamy meats such as a twenty-two-month-old country ham from Kentucky.\n- **Effect on Recipes**: These ingredients are noted for enhancing flavors in a way similar to how grape juice or other singular ingredients do. Despite their initial off-putting smell or taste, they contribute depth and make other ingredients taste better and more organic.\n\n### Concept of Taste Platforms\n\n- **Definition**: \"Taste Platforms\" refer to the primary elements of a meal, such as vegetables, meat, fish, and poultry, which act as the base or foundation of a recipe.\n- **Common Misunderstanding**: It is commonly believed that these platforms are the \"main ingredients,\" but the document suggests thinking of them more as starting points upon which other flavors and ingredients build.\n- **Ingredient Interaction**: The platform elements not only add their intrinsic tastes but also interact with added spices, herbs, and cooking techniques to create a complex flavor profile.\n- **Textural Importance**: The document notes that all platform ingredients generally have a significant textural element that plays a crucial role in the overall eating experience.\n\n---\n\nThis summary encapsulates the key ideas presented in the document regarding how certain unconventional ingredients can influence cooking and the foundational concept of recipes in terms of \"taste platforms\"."

    "contenu": "The document describes the procedures and details involved in determining the dosage of bentonite to use during wine bottling. It is structured into main key points regarding filtration, sterilization, and carbon dioxide content adjustments during the wine bottling process. Below, I will outline the key details and information organized into a structured format:\n\n### Key Details\n1. **Dosage Determination of Bentonite:**\n   - Dosages considered: 20 g/hL, 40 g/hL, 60 g/hL.\n   - Measure of wine turbidity taken before application.\n   - Aim: Ensure water turbidity is less than 2 NTU after bentonite application.\n   - Final dosages aim: 10 mg/L free and under 35 mg/L total, post-application.\n\n2. **Description of Bottling Stages:**\n   - Process occurs on three dates across the production season.\n   - Significant events: Turbidity measurements, adjustments with SO2, and wine stabilization stages following the initial fermentations.\n\n3. **Filtration Process Details:**\n   - Handled by an external provider using two filtration systems.\n   - Systems used: Jumbo Star equipped with a 30 pp filter cartridge, Omnia model system with organic membranes, cleanable and up to 75 hl/h flow rate.\n   - Delta Tofhola ceramic tangential filters of 50 m² also mentioned.\n\n4. **Specific Filtration Techniques:**\n   - Dual filtration approach:\n     - First: Sterilizing filtration through 1.2 µm membrane capturing overall lees.\n     - Second: Aimed to ensure final turbidity between 0.8 to 3 NTU, originating from turbidities between 15 and 50 NTU after initial fermentation.\n     - Final filtration effectiveness gauged by a drop in turbidity to below 3 NTU, performed with 0.65 µm filters.\n   - Integrity test before each batch using a 0.65 µm membrane.\n\n5. **CO2 Adjustment during Bottle Transfer:**\n   - Goal: Reduce CO2 content from 1000 mg/L to 800 mg/L by reintroduction of inert gas to promote freshness and flavor profile.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- A specific mention of poor germ filtration, only using 2 µm filters for backup if germs aren't a critical issue.\n- Final checks for contamination, especially for rose and low FML susceptibility wines.\n- Use of indices CFLA12 and Vmax13 helps determine appropriate time and filtration media based on initial turbidity and filtration volume.\n\n### Closing Details\n- The filtration setup and specific processes are tailored to ensure quality and stability of the wine, balancing freshness with microbial safety.\n\nThe document highlights technical aspects of wine filtration with a focus on precision and quality control using specific equipment and procedural thresholds."
