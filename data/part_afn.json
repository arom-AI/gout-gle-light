It mentions that the introduction of grape varieties such as garnacha, cabernet sauvignon, syrah, and merlot, along with the skills, energy, and ambition of the pioneers, significantly transformed the area. To illustrate the extent of this transformation, an eye-catching statistic is shared: according to the Priorat Consejo Regulador, between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, the price of a donkey in the region increased by 10,000 percent."

    "contenu": "### Huître\n\n#### Introduction\nLa saveur d'une huître reflète, plus que tout autre aliment, l'environnement où elle s'est développée. La propriété, la teneur en minéraux et la température de l'eau sont des facteurs importants, c'est pourquoi il convient d'identifier les huîtres par leur provenance plutôt que par leur espèce. Par exemple, *Ostrea edulis*, l'huître européenne plate indigène, se réfère à la colchester anglaise, la galway irlandaise et, en France, la belon, protégée, ainsi que la marennes, parée d'algues. Lorsque vous commandez un plateau, éloignez le citron mais essayez de détecter les notes que les connaisseurs ont identifiées : sucre, crème, viande, beurre, fruit à coque, melon, écorce de melon, concombre, minéral, métal, cuivre et, bien entendu, saumure et océan. Pour faire l'expérience des saveurs plus complexes après le choc initial de l'eau de mer, vous devriez mâcher votre huître avant de l'avaler. Les saveurs acides comme le citron et le vinaigre amortissent le côté salé et soulignent la douceur des huîtres. Avec le raifort ou le ketchup pimenté se forme une chaude combinaison sucrée-salée où l'huître apporte son umami inhérent. La sauce d'huître est un condiment épicé, noir et salé de Chine; les proportions – et les quantités – d'extraits d'huître, de sucre, de sodium et d'exhausteurs de goût qu'elle contient varient selon les marques.\n\n#### Associations Gastronomiques\n- **Huître & Anis :** voir Anis & Huître.\n- **Huître & Artichaut :** voir Artichaut & Huître.\n- **Huître & Bœuf :** Lorsque Kit offre à petit Jacob ses premières huîtres dans *Le Magasin d'antiquités* de Charles Dickens, l'enfant y prend goût comme s'il était né venu au monde pour cela; il y versait le poivre et le vinaigre avec une dextérité au-dessus de son âge, et finit par bâtir une grotte sur la table avec les écaillés » (traduction de A. Des Essarts). Avant que les stocks d'huîtres ne s'effondrent, elles étaient si abondantes bon marché qu'un serviteur comme Kit pouvait acheter trois douzaines des « plus grandes huîtres qu'on eût jamais vues » sans craindre d'être envoyé en prison pour dettes. Mais ce n'est pas uniquement pour mettre en valeur les ingrédients les plus coûteux qu'on a ajouté de l'huître au steak and kidney pudding (tourte de viande de bœuf et de rognons de bœuf, d'agneau ou de porc). L'huître salée renforce la saveur du bœuf. Il en va de même avec le carpetbag steak australien farci aux huîtres ou encore la sauce d'huître qu'on utilise dans les sautés de bœuf.\n- **Huître & Caviar :** voir Caviar & Huître.\n- **Huître & Céleri :** L'huître fait du céleri un partenaire frais et presque critique : une combinaison plutôt distinguée comme l'atteste parfaitement cette recette d'*huître et céleri de Billy l'Écailleur*, extraite du *Manuel de réception* du magazine *Esquire*, publié pour la première fois en 1954. « Un homme, conseille-t-il, qui peut se permettre d'inviter ses amis chez lui après le théâtre et leur autorise à tartiner un homme qui va vite se retrouver en tête de liste du hit-parade de ses amis. » Faites revenir dans du beurre 3 branches de céleri émincées jusqu'à ce qu'il soit tendre, ajoutez 24 huîtres sans leur coquille, mais avec leur eau, et laissez mijoter jusqu'à ce que les huîtres se recourbent sur les bords. Arrosez d'un vin blanc liquoreux et assaisonnez modérément. Transvasez dans un plat pour garder au chaud, coupez des pointes de pain grillé, tapotez votre cigarette sur l'étui en argent gravé à vos initiales et délectez-vous de l'adoration que vous portent vos amis.\n- **Huître & Champignon :** Le pleurote le plus fréquemment présent sur les étals est le *Pleurotus ostreatus*, le pleurote en forme d'huître. Certaines personnes pensent que ces pleurotes ne ressemblent aucunement aux huîtres, mais ont légèrement le même goût. Ils pourraient bien être des foritures caoutchouteuses sur le bonnet de bain d'une dame fraîchement sortie de la mer. Comme les huîtres, les pleurotes peuvent être saisis rapidement au beurre et servis avec un jus de citron."

    "contenu": "# COMMUNES\n\nThe term _commune_ is used in France to denote a wine village, as in Burgundy's commune of Chambolle-Musigny, or Bordeaux's commune of Margaux. But a commune in France isn't necessarily only related to wine. In fact, communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France, and as such, the equivalent of incorporated cities in the U.S. Communes have revolutionary beginnings. Following the storming of the Bastille prison and the start of the French Revolution in 1789, the first commune—Paris—was created. The idea was to do away with the burdens of class and tradition and create a perfect society—one where everyone was equal, and reason, not tradition, ruled. Indeed, the word _commune_ comes from the medieval Latin word _communia_, meaning “a small gathering of people sharing a common life.” The actual size of a commune, however, can vary from millions, as with Paris, to a dozen or so. There are currently close to 38,000 communes throughout France—and their structure remains largely the same today as when they were set up two centuries ago.\n\n## Significant Events in Wine History\n\nPerhaps the most dramatic period in France’s wine history is the era it would most like to forget. Sometime between 1860 and 1866, the deadly, root-eating phylloxera insect arrived from America. The subsequent devastation it unleashed is thought to have begun in the southern Rhône Valley. From there, the microscopic insect spread throughout the country, throughout Europe, and eventually throughout much of the world (see box, page 30). Even after French vineyards recovered by planting phylloxera-tolerant American root-stock, the country’s wine areas were never the same. Many French regions today are half the size they were before the phylloxera epidemic.\n\n_Image Caption_: Vineyards are enclosed by hand-built stone terraces on the steep hillsides of Cornas in the northern Rhône Valley.\n\n## French Gastronomy\n\nThe French take their food and wine very seriously. (The national school lunch program consists of a four-course meal that ends with cheese!) Indeed, historically, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, French schoolchildren have gone on field trips to three-star restaurants in order to taste foods such as foie gras, Bresse chickens, Isigny butter, and other famous French products, including, sometimes, wines."

    "contenu": "# Propagating Tempeh Spores\n\nThere are many different ways of propagating tempeh spores. As with all things tempeh, William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi's books have the most comprehensive information on propagating tempeh.^[22] In Indonesia, some tempeh is typically grown sandwiched between leaves of *waru* hibiscus trees (*Hibiscus tiliaceus Linn*). This tempeh is allowed to overripen, and the spores become bound in the hairy leaves, which are dried and used by mixing dehulled, cooked, and cooled beans by hand, holding a leaf, spore side out, in one hand. Any overripened sporulating tempeh can be used as a starter. But the more meticulous you can be, the purer the progeny. In the traditional context of mixed cultures, this wasn’t an issue at all, because the tempeh community of fungi and bacteria had stability. “In Indonesia, good-quality mixed culture starter is prepared daily in thousands of neighborhood tempeh shops under extremely unsanitary conditions,” point out Shurtleff and Aoyagi.^[23] In the context of pure culture tempeh, which is what most of us outside of Indonesia know, each generation presents the possibility of contamination by bacteria and weakening of the mold. To maintain a pure culture requires scrupulous and methodical effort."

Yolks break more easily in older eggs.\n- **Types of Eggs**: Room temperature eggs recommended; refrigerated or dried egg whites also usable with adjustments.\n- **Additives**: Meringue powder or sugar helps stabilize the foam.\n\n#### Bowl and Whisk\n- **Size**: Should accommodate an eightfold expansion of egg whites.\n- **Material**: Avoid plastic bowls due to interaction with fats and soaps.\n\n#### Interpreting the Foam’s Appearance\n- **Optimal foam**: Judged by weight support (e.g., a coin), surface appearance (glossy or dry), and bubble structure.\n- **Mixing variables**: Different dishes require foams of varying stiffness and stability.\n\n#### Foam Stages\n- **Glossy Soft Peaks**: Peaks bend at tips when whisk is lifted.\n- **Stiff Peaks**: Peaks stand straight without bending.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Cleaning**: Regular cleaning suffices to prepare bowls for egg beating.\n- **Whisking Tool**: Balloon whisks cover more volume and speed up the process; stand mixers with beater attachments are efficient but may produce denser textures."

The island’s formidable terrain and maritime climate are significant obstacles to success, but then almost everything about Madeira is rather miraculous, including the intricate and painstaking manner by which the wine is made (more on this in a moment).\n\nThe main island and its minuscule sisters are the tops of a vast mountain range under the Atlantic Ocean (thought by some to be the lost continent of Atlantis). Volcanic in origin, these summits are deeply fissured peaks of basalt (cooled lava), stacked accordionlike one next to the other and separated by narrow ravines.\n\nThe main island (where all of the vineyards are located) possesses just over 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of grapevines. While bananas and sugarcane are grown extensively near the coasts, grapes tend to be grown higher up in the mountains, nearer the tops of the peaks—at altitudes from 600 to 1,300 feet (180 to 400 meters). Because the sheer cliff faces are difficult to cultivate, terraces were built by hand centuries ago (much as they were in the Douro). Necessarily, the vineyards themselves are often just tiny plots (locally referred to as _jardim_—gardens). Even today, they are tended and harvested by hand (at considerable expense), for machinery has proven virtually impossible to use in this landscape."

Celery and black truffles are my favorite combination. They work in part because they come out of the ground at the same time of year. Any root vegetable also works with celery.

Here is the structured content from the text:\n\n### International Varieties\n- **Cava**: Predominantly planted in Catalunya and is mainly used for Cava production. \n  - **Key Varieties**: Macabeo, which is also known as Viura in Rioja.\n- **Characteristics of Viura**: Often used for still wine production, imparting herb and spice aromas; traditionally in heavily oaked white Riojas.\n\n### Regions and Wines\n\n#### The Upper Ebro\n- **Rioja**: \n  - **Sub-regions**: Rioja Alta, Rioja Alavesa, and Rioja Baja.\n  - **Location**: Around Logroño; the Rioja Alta and Alavesa are in the foothills of Cantabrian Mountains.\n  - **Climate**: Rioja Alta has the freshest climate, Rioja Baja is less maritime but hotter due to its eastern positioning further from the Atlantic.\n  - **Wine Styles**: Known for Tempranillo, which gives red fruit flavors, medium level of tannins and benefits from the body and alcohol. Also noted for Garnacha and Graciano in blends.\n\n#### Castilla y León\n- **Notable Designation**: Vino de la Tierra.\n- **Location**: North towards Meseta Central.\n- **Wine Characteristics**: Known for international varieties like Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Merlot. \n\n### Other Key Points\n- **Influence of the Cantabrian Mountains**: These mountains help protect Rioja, especially Rioja Baja, from the effects of the Atlantic weather.\n- **Rainfall**: Generally low in Rioja Baja, causing issues for growers such as drought.\n- **Winemaking Techniques**: Includes extended maceration, use of destemmed and crushed fruit, vigorous management resulting in colorful, fruit flavorful wines.\n- **Modern Trends**: Producers in Rioja are making more colorful, fruit style wines, defining role in Rioja. There is also a move towards international varieties that can offer unique profiles and complement traditional wines.\n- **Conservation Techniques**: For white Rioja, traditional deep golden colored wines have fallen out of favor, and there is a shift towards fresher, more modern styles made with minimal contact with oxygen, using barrel or less oxidative methods.\n\n### Navarra\n- **Location**: To the north and east borders of Rioja.\n- **Climate and Styles**: Similar to Rioja but with a focus on Tempranillo, preparing wine in a style that uses both modern and traditional vinification methods.\n- **Wine Recommendations**: Garnacha grapes for rosé production, and Graciano are particularly noted for good value wines called 'Joven wines' which are protected and handled carefully for quality."

    "contenu": "The document is structured under the main heading \"UNDERSTANDING WINES: EXPLAINING STYLE AND QUALITY\" and discusses various factors that influence vineyard management and wine style, particularly focusing on \"Density\" and providing \"EXAMPLES OF VINEYARD MANAGEMENT.\"\n\n### Density\nDiscusses the concept of planting density in vineyards, defined by the number of vines planted per area. Density can vary from as low as 1000 vines per hectare to as high as 10,000 vines per hectare. Factors like nutrient and water availability are key considerations affecting density decisions.\n\n### Examples of Vineyard Management\nProvides insight into vineyard management decisions through two examples, noting how legal and environmental factors influence these decisions:\n\n#### Example 1: Scenario in a Hot, Very Sunny Region\n- **Location**: A hot, very sunny region with an island environment.\n- **Challenges**: Very low rainfall and no or limited irrigation water available.\n- **Choices and Reasoning**:\n  - **Planting at Low Density**: Due to limited water, a low density is necessary to ensure each vine has sufficient water to survive.\n  - **Using Bush or Trellis Vines**: To manage sunlight and reduce the risk of sunburned grapes. Low density and the lack of rainfall also reduce the risk of fungal diseases due to lower disease pressure.\n\n#### Example 2: Scenario Near the Coast\n- **Location**: Close to the coast with a moderate climate and high levels of rainfall.\n- **Challenges**: Fertile but low soil fertility.\n- **Choices and Reasoning**:\n  - **High Density Planting**: Encouraged due to ample water availability and to manage vegetative growth.\n  - **Handling High Rainfall**: Adjustments like opening the canopy are necessary to maximize light penetration and reduce disease potential from damp conditions.\n\n#### Additional Comments\nThe document implies that successful vineyard management must adapt to local environmental conditions, like water availability, soil fertility, and risk of diseases, to optimize both the grape quality and the efficiency of vine growth, ensuring sustainable wine production."

Various chefs offer their personal experiences and preferences for using bananas in different dishes. Below is the structured content extracted from the document:\n\n1. **Dominique Duby, Wild Sweets (Vancouver):**\n   - Overripe bananas are best used by freezing them whole in their peel until they turn black. Once thawed, they are pureed and used in cakes or mousses to enhance flavor.\n   \n2. **Michael Laiskonis, Le Bernardin (New York City):**\n   - Describes a unique dish: banana crème brûlée, not made in ramekins but cut from a sheet of caramelized banana setup in a grid. The dish is served with caramelized bananas, citrus biscuit, two types of brown butter ice cream (one with banana, the other with caramel), and finished with a peanut-caramel sauce.\n   \n3. **Emily Luchetti, Farallon (San Francisco):**\n   - Prefers bananas that are yellow and firm.

Each entry is a brief exposition on the culinary synergy between the ham and the highlighted pairing. Here is the content structured into a concise format for each pairing discussed:\n\n---\n\n### Jambon Cru & Figues\n- **Source:** *Italian Food, Elizabeth David*\n- **Description:** Praises the use of raw ham with melon or, even better, figs. Notes the subtlety and richness of the combination, especially how well the ham complements the delicate fragrance and sweetness of fully ripe figs. This pairing is highly recommended, especially when figs are in season.\n\n### Jambon Cru & Genièvre\n- **Process:** Typical Tuscan raw ham often rubbed with a mix of salt, juniper, and spices to enhance flavor.\n- **Flavor Profile:** Offers a savory appeal, different from typical cold cuts like Italian speck. This particular ham is also immersed in juniper brine and then aged.\n- **Serving Suggestion:** Enjoyed after several weeks of aging; enhances its smoked and spiced characteristics.\n\n### Jambon Cru & Melon\n- **Source:** *Harold McGee*\n- **Description:** Discusses how the aging processes increase volatile compounds in ham that pair exceptionally well with melon due to melon's characteristic aroma. Suggests using Cantaloupe for its sweet and slightly nutty flavor.\n- **Tip:** Avoid overripe or excessively sweet melons which can overpower the flavors; ensure the melon is not overly ripe to maintain a good texture contrast with the ham.\n\n### Jambon Cru & Œuf\n- **Suggestion:** Refer to a section (not included in the excerpt) titled \"Œuf & Jambon cru\".\n\n### Jambon Cru & Olive\n- **Ingredient:** Small arbequina olives recommended.\n- **Flavor Profile:** Combines well with ham due to its slightly withered appearance but rich, buttery, and fruity flavors, complementing the raw ham without overwhelming it.\n\n### Jambon Cru & Pêche\n- **Source:* Judy Rodgers, Zuni Cafe*\n- **Description:** Encourages trying raw ham with white peaches, noting their floral aroma and slight bitterness which can enhance the flavors of the ham, making for a sophisticated and harmonious pairing.\n\n### Jambon Cru & Poire\n- **Suggestion:** Refer to a section (not included in the excerpt) titled \"Poire & Jambon cru\".\n\n### Jambon Cru & Pois\n- **Source:** *Pellegrino Artusi (1820-1911)*\n- **Description:** Describes traditional Roman dishes that featured peas and raw ham, heralded by chefs for their simplicity yet delightful flavor harmonies.\n- **Serving Suggestion:** Ideal for a quick sauté or as part of a dish with accompaniments or a syrupy reduction, often incorporating crispy elements of ham for texture and flavor depth.\n\n---\n\nThis structured summary pulls out the primary culinary insights and recommendations from the document, focusing on the unique characteristics and serving methods for various pairings with raw ham."

    "contenu": "# THE STEEPEST VINEYARD IN THE WORLD\n\nThe steepest vineyard in Germany—and in the world—is Calmont, located between the villages of Bremm and Eller on the Mosel River. The vineyard, whose name roughly translates to rocky mountain, was carved by the Mosel more than 400 million years ago, and has been planted with grapes for more than 1,500 years. Calmont's 60- to 70-degree incline makes it look like a vertical wall of vines, all tenaciously gripping the slatey cliff.\n\nTerraces are built into the hill and fortified with rock walls, but they are constantly crumbling into the river and needing to be rebuilt. There are no roads through Calmont, only winding paths and one miniature monorail for bringing fertilizer up and harvested grapes down—everything else must be carried by the vineyard crew. In fact, because of the back-breaking labor required to harvest the vineyard, only 13 of its 20 acres (5 of its 8 hectares) are currently in production, and that number is decreasing every year.\n\n--- \n\n**The famous grayish-blue slate of the Mosel holds heat well, helping riesling to ripen.**\n\n---\n\nOn the palate, riesling is meant to move—to shimmer, to surge, to burst, to dance, to arc, to soar. Riesling has a rare trait—velocity. Of all varietals, it is the most kinetic and alive.\n\nIf fine wine is to be made, then, vineyards must be nothing short of perfectly sited, so that each ray of light and warmth is maximized. As a result, the Mosel’s vineyards hug only south-facing slopes. At each turn of the river where the banks face north, the slopes have no vines. In addition, the best vineyards are quite close to the river itself, for even the reflection of light off the water becomes one more increment in the quest for ripeness.\n\nThen there’s the issue of slate. The famous slate (sometimes blue-gray in color, sometimes burnt orange-red) of the Mosel is highly porous and heat retaining. The soil’s porosity is an advantage in downpours, when powerful rains might otherwise cause mass erosion. (When some slate does wash down the slopes, the precious rocks, so necessary for ripeness, are immediately carried back up the hill.)"
