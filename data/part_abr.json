    "contenu": "### FEELING THE TEXTURE\n\nClosely related to body is texture, sometimes called mouthfeel. A wine’s texture is the tactile impression it has in your mouth. This impression is the result of stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. (The largest of the cranial nerves, the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensations in the face and mouth.) Fabrics are often used as metaphors for texture or mouthfeel. A wine can be as soft as flannel (an Australian shiraz, for example), as seamlessly smooth as silk (a pinot noir), or as coarse and scratchy as wool (some southern French reds feel this way). It can also feel syrupy, gritty, crackling crisp, or have any of dozens of other textures. In order to assess a wine’s texture, you must roll it around in your mouth and feel it. And what’s causing a wine’s texture in the first place? Acidity, tannin, alcohol, ripeness, and sweetness, to name the major influencers.\n\nTexture is probably the least talked-about dimension of wine, but I’d argue that, with food, it’s one of the key characteristics in determining preferences. Does anyone think that the texture of, say, steak is beside the point? That it’s only the flavor of the steak that counts? Similarly, it’s rarely just the lightly herbal, minerally flavors of Sancerre that someone loves, it’s also Sancerre’s spring-loaded snap of crispness.\n\n#### HOW FAST ARE YOUR TASTEBUDS?\n\nAccording to Dr. Hildegarde Heymann, a professor and enologist in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, the human body can taste faster than it can see, touch, or hear. Taste perception is swift because the tongue and mouth (assisted by the nose) are the body’s primary defenses against poison. Here's how fast perception occurs after initial stimulation, as measured in thousandths of a second, for our four main senses:\n\n| Sense   | Response Time (milliseconds) |\n|---------|-------------------------------|\n| TASTE   | 1.5–4.0                        |\n| TOUCH   | 2.4–8.9                        |\n| HEARING | 13–22                          |\n| VISION  | 13–45                          |"

    "contenu": "### THE ID OF COFFEE\n\nUnlike cafés anywhere in the world, from Rome to Seattle, the Viennese coffeehouse is only tangentially about drinking coffee. Here, in the city where psychoanalysis was born, a coffeehouse is home to a complex ritual—more intimate than social, supremely private even within the public domain.\n\nTraditionally, coffeehouses were more or less demarcated by profession or social ranking. There were coffeehouses for politicians, coffeehouses for artists, coffeehouses for scholars, and so on. Every person had a single place to which he or she went exclusively. At a minimum, you spent an hour at a coffeehouse (no quickly-downed espressos), but more commonly, you would spend several hours and possibly the entire day there. Coffee would be ordered by color—gold, light gold, blond, dark gold—according to the amount of milk added, and would be served on a small tray with a few sugar cubes and a glass of water. The main activity was, and still is, reading newspapers provided by the house, although you could also write or work in complete solitude, using the café table as a private desk. Since the waiters knew every customer and his or her preferred coffee, you never really had to utter a single word. When people did go to the coffeehouse in pairs, it was either to read in mutual silence or to discuss problems or personal intimacies. Still, private conversation, not social banter, was the custom.\n\nModern life has changed Viennese coffeehouses, but not by much. During the daytime, a respectful solemnity still prevails. People just sit, think, read, and sip coffee. At night, coffeehouses become somewhat more animated, serving goulash and then coffee and strudel to opera-and theatergoers.\n\nIn the late fall and winter, coffee can become more substantial, including a particularly fortifying rendition called a *fiaker*. Made with liberal amounts of rum and whipped cream, *fiakers* are named after the open horse-drawn carriages that once transported people through the streets of Vienna. Riding in a *fiaker* on a cold Austrian night made you want to stop and sip a *fiaker*.\n\nAmong Vienna's best coffeehouses: Café Hawelka, Café Landtmann, Café Sacher, Café Sperl, Demel Konditorei, and Heiner Konditorei.\n\n### Wines of Austria\n\nIf Grüner Veltliner is Austria’s signature gift to the world of white wine, then Blaufränkisch is its red gift. Undoubtedly noble in origin and very old (though its parentage isn’t completely clear), Blaufränkisch combines the words *blau*, meaning “blue,” and *fränkisch*, an old German designation for “a fine wine.” Austrian Blaufränkisch is precise and sleek—spicy, herbal, and floral—and all of this plus the flavors of delicious woodland berries and a sense of forestiness. Most of all, Blaufränkisch has grip and bite. It is exactly what one so often wants in order to splice through the meatiness of meat. Despite its appeal, Blaufränkisch is not the leading red grape of Austria. That would be Zweigelt. A cross of Blaufränkisch and a usually more simple grape called St. Laurent, Zweigelt makes a juicy, fruity, easy wine."

The vineyards here, along with those in Hungary, formed a vast, uninterrupted sea of vines during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Burgenland is known primarily for its opulent sweet wines, as well as some remarkable reds.\n\nSweet wines have been the glory of this part of central Europe for eons. The most celebrated type—_ausbruch_—is made mostly from grapes infected by _Botrytis cinerea_, although some of the grapes can simply be dried and shriveled. For _ausbruch_, these grapes are then mixed with freshly pressed must from grapes that are only partially botrytized. (Reflecting Burgenland’s proximity to Hungary, this process is similar to the manner in which Hungary’s famous sweet wine, Tokaji Aszú, is made; see page 632.) Both the fully and partially botrytized grapes for _ausbruch_ must come from the same vineyard. The grapes are sometimes foot-trodden, and the wine is aged in casks. _Ausbruch_ is more baroque, outrageous, bruléed, and honeyed than _beerenauslese_, but has less residual sugar and more alcohol than _trockenbeerenauslese_.\n\nThe most famous _ausbruch_ etc., as well as BAs and TBAs, are made possible by a hauntingly beautiful natural entity: an almost supernatural lake poised between northern Burgenland and Hungary named Neusiedl (the Austrians call this the Neusiedlersee). More than 186 square miles (482 square kilometers) in size, it is only 2 to 7 feet (0.6 to 2 meters) deep. The shallow lake gives up so much humidity that it is threatened by constant evaporation. In fact, twice during the past century it dried up completely. Reeds and grasses love the lake. So many of them grow around it that thatching material developed into a local industry. Birds also love the lake. Indeed, the vast bird population has resulted in the area becoming one of Europe’s largest wildlife preserves. And thanks to the thousands of storks that nest and feed here, the lake has been called a stork smorgasbord. But as much as the reeds or the birds, grapes love the lake. It’s where they love to rot."

Below are the key points detailed in the text:\n\n1. **Characteristics of Vin Santo:**\n   - Vin Santo is not typically served at ceremonial occasions but is a customary conclusion to even modest Tuscan meals, enjoyed with small biscotti called cantucci.\n   - The wine, known for its delicate, creamy, honey-roasted flavor, can have a color range from radiant amber to neon orange.\n   - Its sweetness levels vary, and some Vin Santo wines can even be bone-dry.\n\n2. **Production Method:**\n   - The production of Vin Santo remains artisanal and labor-intensive.\n   - The process starts with the drying of partially dried grapes such as malvasia bianca lunga or trebbiano, which are hung in airy places like attics to concentrate the sugars.\n   - This is followed by crushing the grapes, blending with madre (a remnant of residue from previous batches), and fermenting in sealed barrels for three to five years in warm locations.\n   - Commonly oak barrels are used, but some producers use barrels made from different types of wood like juniper, cherry, and chestnut to enhance the complexity of the wine’s flavor.\n\n3. **Outcome Variabilities:**\n   - The meticulous process of making Vin Santo can sometimes lead to the production of high-quality vinegar if the winemaking process does not yield the desired outcome.\n\nThe document covers the traditional aspects and modern adaptations in the making of Vin Santo, presenting an informative outline of both the cultural significance and the detailed production techniques of this historical wine."

They are particularly useful when explaining the differences in both wine styles among producers and wine tastes among consumers. The winemaking style of classic Old World regions, including France and Italy, is rooted in centuries of tradition and emphasizes distinctiveness, or typicity. Terroir is the term used to describe the individuality of a given site for grapes, its flavor fingerprint independent of the stylistic inputs of the winemaker. The Old World is, or at least once was, more focused on celebrating the special characteristics inherent in each vineyard, whether the soil types that impart unique flavor characteristics or the distinctive differences among vintages. New World regions such as the United States and Chile, by contrast, are pioneering an approach that relies more on technological innovation and stylized winemaking formulas to achieve commercial acceptance. The newcomers are most comfortable in the position of control, from irrigation of the vineyards to cultured strains of yeast. This approach leaves little to chance, trusting in better living through wine chemistry.\"\n\n---\n\n**Author Info:**\n\nRandall Grahm is the founder and fearless leader of Bonny Doon Vineyard and one of California’s most eccentric and influential vintners. Like Columbus seeking a trade route to Asia, Grahm set sail in 1979 for the Great American Pinot Noir, foundered on the shoals of astringency and finesselessness, and ended up running aground in the utterly unexpected New World of Rhône and Italian grape varieties. A citizen of the world, he is perhaps best known as a champion of the strange and the heterodox, of the ugly duckling grape varieties whose very existence is threatened by the dominant Cabo- and Chardo-centric paradigms."

Fermentation temperatures above 95°F/35°C make the soybeans highly susceptible to Bacillus subtilis. While soybeans don't smell as sweet as when combined with roasted wheat, they still produce a pleasant aroma.\n\n#### **Reference to Related Content**\n\nThe text mentions a reference to \"Soy Sauce in chapter 11\" where the reader can find additional information related to the subject.\n\n#### **Propagation of Koji Starter (Tane Koji)**\n\nThe process of propagating koji starter, using brown rice (referred to as \"seed koji\"), is outlined. White rice isn't used because it lacks essential nutrients required for optimal mold growth. \n\n- **Preparation of Rice:** The brown rice should be soaked, drained, steamed, and cooled. \n- **Inoculation:** Hardwood ashes are mixed in (about 1.5% by weight of the rice) to provide potassium, magnesium, and other nutrients. Then the rice is inoculated.\n- **Fermentation:** The inoculated mixture is incubated at approximately 79°F/26°C, initially for 24 hours. It's then remounted for another 24 hours, and after 48 hours, spread onto cotton and left undisturbed to encourage mold growth.\n- **Drying and Storage:** After a total of 96 hours and visible growth, the koji is dried in an oven or dehydrator at about 113°F/45°C and stored in a cool, dark place.\n  \n#### **Utilization**\n\nThe dried starter can be used whole, ground into meal, or further processed to extract spores. Mixing with flour is also suggested, particularly for miso production.\n\n#### **Reference Work**\n\nThe process described is sourced from Shurtleff and Aoyagi's book \"Miso Production,\" which further elaborates on the topic in a dedicated chapter.\n\n---\nThis breakdown provides a clearer structure of the steps necessary for the propagation of koji, important notes on temperatures for different stages of the process, and references for deeper understanding."

A pump in the carbonator forces the water under pressure into the stainless-steel carbonator tank, where CO2 is fed into the stainless tank at a pressure of 100–110 psi to supply gas and pressure (indicated by yellow lines).\n- **Process**: \n  - Room-temperature seltzer exits the tank and moves toward a cold plate in an ice machine (indicated by green lines).\n  - The seltzer runs through the cold plate twice, which is noted as a secret to the setup, and then exits and heads above the cabinet to the seltzer tap.\n\n### The Advantages of Using a Whipper with Nitrous Oxide for Carbonation:\n- **Purpose**: Allows for experimentation with nitrous oxide, commonly used for whipped cream, to carbonate drinks differently.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Nitrous oxide used in a whipper generally preserves the creamy taste without making the cream taste carbonated or spoiled.\n  - Although nitrous doesn’t significantly flavor whipped cream, it imparts a sweet flavor and is described as being noticeably sweet.\n  - It works well in coffee and chocolate-flavored drinks adding body and liveliness without excessive carbonation.\n- **Advice**:\n  - Avoid using milk in nitrous oxide-carbonated drinks as it foams excessively.\n- **Carbonation Technique**:\n  - For mixed gas drinks, start with normal carbonation using two CO2 cartridges, then finish with a nitrous oxide cartridge.\n  - Using a mix of gases, specifically 80% CO2 and 20% N₂O in super cold ice water, can replicate the flavor of a preferred bubbly water form.\n\nThere are no tables in the document to be structured, only text and image descriptions, which have been structured into the content above."
