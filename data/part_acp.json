It reads:\n\n\"the wines of a given area will share certain characteristics of flavor. However, this has been difficult to demonstrate in the U.S., where winemakers often treat wines in vastly different ways. So in the U.S., it can be very hard to determine exactly what is contributing to any given flavor: some characteristic of the place—or something the winemaker did.\"\n\n### Image Description\nThe image presents a rustic, agricultural scene typical of many wine regions in the United States. It depicts an old farm setting where traditional methods are employed in wine agriculture. There are sheep in a vineyard, with a man possibly a farmer or a winemaker interacting with these animals. This illustration underscores the traditional, rural aspects of some American wine-regions, emphasizing the connection to more classic farming methods.\n  \n### Caption\nThe image is accompanied by a caption that states:\n\n\"Many of the wine regions in the United States are beautifully rural places, where old farming families work the land using traditional methods.\"\n\nThis caption complements the message in the main text, focusing on the traditional nature of many wine-producing areas in the U.S."

    "contenu": "The text primarily discusses \"poi,\" a traditional Hawaiian dish made from taro root. Key points from the document are outlined below:\n\n1. **Processing and Microbial Action:** Grinding the corms (the edible part of taro) immediately after heating helps break down bacterial clumps or colonies. This process not only increases the number of organisms but also improves their distribution within the poi, resulting in a more uniform fermentation.\n\n2. **Preference and Fermentation:** People's preference for poi varies from mild (one day old) to sour (several days old), influenced by fermentation time, which can range from one to several days depending on the local climate. Cooler temperatures can slow down the fermentation process. The color and texture of poi also change as fermentation progresses.\n\n3. **Consistency and Preparation:** The consistency of poi can vary from thin to very thick, often described by the number of fingers it takes to eat (e.g., two-finger poi is considered ideal). The thickness or runniness can be adjusted by adding water.\n\n4. **Nutritional and Medicinal Benefits:** Poi is noted for its healing properties and potential nutritional benefits, especially for infants who are intolerant to other foods like breast milk or soy formula. Research and anecdotal evidence suggest that poi could be beneficial for infants with allergies or failure-to-thrive issues, and it may also have anti-tumor and immune-stimulating effects.\n\nThis summary captures the key details outlined in the document regarding the culinary and health-related aspects of poi."

    "contenu": "Here is the structured content from the provided document:\n\n---\n\n### Léon Beyer, Domaine Ostertag, and Zind Humbrecht.\n\n## PINOT BLANC\n\nJust like pinot gris, pinot blanc is, genetically speaking, a clone of pinot noir. Alsace's pinot blanc (also known as klevner) is easy to like, dependable, and safe. It’s never as thrilling as riesling, as dramatic as gewürztraminer, or as novel as pinot gris; nonetheless, the top Alsace pinot blancs are tasty wines with baked-apple flavors and a light texture. Unfortunately, there are also many bland versions.\n\nHistorically, some older pinot blanc vineyards also contained a small percentage of vines later identified as the Burgundian white grape Auxerrois. Thus, some Alsace pinot blancs may be, technically speaking, field blends. Top producers of pinot blanc include Domaine Albert Boxler, Josmeyer, and Domaine Weinbach.\n\n## PINOT NOIR\n\nThe only red wine made in Alsace is pinot noir. In the past, the quality was so variable that much of it ended up looking like rosé. Then, in the 1990s, a few of the top wineries began rethinking their approach, planting pinot noir in better sites, lowering the yields, using better equipment and aging the wine in new barrels. As expected, the wine got better. A lot better. In good vintages Marcel Deiss’s Bergheim Burlenberg pinot noir, Ostertag’s Fronholz pinot noir, and Hugel’s Jubilee pinot noir show earthy, complex, almost Burgundy-like flavors.\n\nLike all other Alsace wines, pinot noir must, by law, be bottled in tall, Germanic flute bottles. Because it's surprising, if not a little unnerving, to see red wine flow from what looks like a bottle of riesling, several producers are battling the bottle law, in hopes of having the rule changed.\n\n## VENDANGE TARDIVE AND SÉLECTION DE GRAINS NOBLES\n\nTwo sensational types of late-harvest wines, vendange tardive (VT) and sélection de grains nobles (SGN), can be made only in certain favorable years (sometimes only once or twice a decade) and even then they generally make up less than 1 percent of the region’s production.\n\nBut sensational isn't nearly adequate as an adjective. These wines can be astonishing in the depth and vividness of their flavors. By law, only the four grape varieties allowed for Grand Cru wines may be used: riesling, gewürztraminer, pinot gris, and muscat. By the time they are picked, the grapes for VT wines may be (but don’t have to be) infected with Botrytis cinerea, the noble rot responsible for Sauternes.\n\n---"

Here’s an outline of the structured content along with some highlighted points:\n\n1. **Character Traits of Wine and Food**: The text emphasizes that wine does not necessarily need to match the dish strictly by its origin or traditional pairings. For instance, an Argentinean Malbec does not exclusively pair with Argentinean dishes like \"asado.\"\n\n2. **Psychological Aspects of Wine and Food Pairing**: It highlights that people’s emotions and environments (friends, location, etc.) influence the rationale behind food pairings more than the inherent properties of the wine or food itself.\n\n3. **Concept of Flavors and Tastes**:\n   - **Flavors and Tastes**: Distinguishes between 'flavors,' which are subjective and 'tastes,' which are objective and quantifiable.\n   - **Primary Tastes**: Identifies the primary tastes as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami – a recently recognized taste associated with flavors of richness like those found in mushrooms, parmesan cheese, and soy sauce.\n\n4. **Impact of Taste on Pairings**:\n   - **Role of Primary Tastes**: Discusses how these fundamental tastes play a role in food and wine pairings, hinting at a blend of creating harmonious or contrasting pairings depending on the taste profiles involved.\n\n5. **Impact of Perception**:\n   - **Perception Changes**: Notes that the perception of wine changes when it is tasted alone versus with food, impacting how pairings are viewed and judged.\n\n6. **Influence of Literature on Wine Pairing**:\n   - Reference to the newsletter \"Wine and Food Companion\" penned by David Rosengarten and Joshua Wesson in the 1990s, and the book \"Red Wine with Fish,\" which are indicated as influential works in the field of wine and food pairing.\n\nThis document draws on the nuances of how food and wine pairing can transcend traditional boundaries, suggesting a more eclectic and subjective approach depending on individual preferences and situational contexts. It also emphasizes the importance of the psychological aspect and personal experience in creating satisfying pairings."

Oak can add desirable aromatic qualities, but as with all condiments, it should be used sparingly. Barrels also soften a wine, just as slow-cooking tenderizes a tough cut of meat. Oak treatment brings forward a wine’s development, making it easier and more pleasurable to drink when it is still relatively young. Oaked wines are neither superior nor inferior, however, for barrel treatment is more flattering to some wine styles than others.\n\nOther woods have been used for wine barrels, but they are either high in undesirable resins and oils, such as chestnut, or too porous to be practical, like pine. Oak is low in porosity, making it dense enough to contain liquids, yet it can be easily bent into rounded shapes. It also has an acceptable tannin content and mild aromatic compounds that harmonize intrinsically with wine. More than 99.9 percent of wine barrels are made of oak, as are those used for whiskies and brandies.\n\nOak barrels were first used by the Romans for the practical purpose of transporting wine. These convenient vessels proved able to boost wine's flavor and texture.\n\n**TOM STEVENSON** is the author of *The New Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopedia*, widely considered to be the standard industry reference for the wine trade. He is also the world's foremost authority on the wines of Champagne. He has written prolifically about wine for more than 30 years, producing 23 critically acclaimed books and receiving 30 awards for wine writing. An occasional contributor to *Decanter* magazine and columnist for *The World of Fine Wine* and the online magazine *Wine-pages*, he is founding editor of DK’s ground-breaking *Wine Report* books, an annual series detailing the state of the wine world.\n\n---\n\n**WINE SECRETS** (Page 32)\n\n---"

The key points about \"Gran reservas\" from the document are as follows:\n\n- **Rarity and Production**: Gran reservas are extremely rare, constituting only 1 to 10 percent of all wines produced annually.\n- **Types**: The document mentions two types of gran reservas:\n  - **White Gran Reservas**: These are uncommon and currently produced by only a handful of bodegas.\n  - **Red Gran Reservas**: These are described as elegant, silky, and refined.\n- **Aging Process**: Gran reservas are aged the longest among wines, in the oldest and most neutral barrels. While the law requires a minimum of five years of aging, in practice, they may be aged for much longer.\n\nThese wines are distinct not only due to their limited production but also because of their extended aging process, which contributes significantly to their refined qualities."

Below are the detailed content structures illustrated within the image:\n\n### Baechu Kimchi Aroma Profile\n\n**Text Explanation:**\n- While the oniony odor of cabbage is prominent in Baechu Kimchi, it also features notes of spicy gochugaru paste, fish heat, and a red-bell-pepper-like nuance. Ginger adds a citrusy, floral touch, while salted shrimp gives a roasted dimension. Fermentation processes alter aroma molecule concentrations, introducing methional (potato-like smell), butanoic acid (cheese-like), and a buttery scent of diacetyl. Amino acids and lactobacilli in the kimchi facilitate fermentation, helping balance the spiciness and garlic odour, tempering the strong garlic presence.\n\n### Circular Graph Legend:\nThe circular graph depicts various flavor categories with specific flavors radiating from the center:\n\n- **Herbaceous**: Kale, asparagus, bell pepper\n- **Animal**: Cheesy\n- **Spicy**: Chilli\n- **Ferments**: Beer\n- **Roast notes**: Malt\n- **Oily Fats**: Butter\n- **Sweet Aromatics**: Vanilla, maple\n- **Aldehydic**: Cilantro, floral\n- **Allium**: Onion, garlic, mushroom\n- **Sulfurous**: Broccoli, red bell pepper\n\n### Baechu Kimchi Flavor Compatibility:\n\nBelow the circular graph is a table showing the compatibility of Baechu Kimchi with other foods, using a color-coded system to indicate varying degrees of flavor matching:\n\n```markdown\n| Food Item         | Total Smell | Animal | Balsamic | Burnt | Caramellic | Citrus | Fermented | Floral | Fruity | Green | Maritime | Nutty | Spicy | Sulfurous | Sweet |\n|--------------------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Roast Chicken     | ••••         | •      | •••      | •     | •          |        | ••         |        | •      |       |          | •••   | ••••  | •         | •     |\n| Red Sorrel        | ••           |        |          |       | •          | ••     |            | ••     | •      | •••   |          |       | •     |           |       |\n| Melon             | ••           |        |          |       |            | •      | •           | ••     | •••    | •     |          |       | •     |           | •••   |\n| Pear              | •••          |        |          |       | •          | •      | ••          | ••     | ••••   | ••    |          |       | •     |           | •••   |\n| Bottarga          | ••           | ••     |          |       |            |        | ••          |        |        |       | ••••     |       |       | ••••       |       |\n| Dill              | •••          |        |          |       |            |        | •           | ••     |        | ••••  |          |       | •••   |           |       |\n| Colombian Coffee  | ••           | •      |          | •••   | ••••       | •      |             |        |        |       |          | ••    |       |           | •     |\n| Roast Wild Boar   | •••          | •••    |          | •     | •          |        | ••          |        | •      |       |          | •••   | ••    | •         | •     |\n| Lemon Balm        | •            |        |          |       |            | ••     | •           | •••    | •      | ••    |          |       | •     |           | •     |\n| Pan-Fried King Prawn | •••       | •      |          |       | •          | ••     | ••          | •      | ••     | •     | ••••     |       | •     | •         | •     |\n```\n\nLegend for compatibility: 1 dot signifies mild compatibility, and increasing number of dots up to 4 signifies stronger compatibility.\n\nThis image presents a comprehensive overview of the flavors and food compatibilities associated with Baechu Kimchi, utilizing visual and textual elements to inform the reader."

The text notes that crosses and hybrids have been included for reference purposes, though they make up a small part of the modern industry. Below is the structured content for each category:\n\n### WHITES\n- **CAYUGA**: A French-American hybrid, Cayuga is often used in off-dry blends and for dessert wines.\n- **CHARDONNAY**: A major grape; the good to very good wines it becomes are leaner in style than California chardonnays.\n- **GEWÜRZTRAMINER**: One of New York's best-kept secrets, it can be turned into delicious wines reminiscent of the gewürztraminers of Alsace.\n- **NIAGARA**: Foxy-tasting American cross that is often made into off-dry and dessert wines. It was first bred in the 1860s by growers in Niagara County, New York.\n- **RIESLING**: A major grape that makes many dynamic, vibrant dry wines, as well as delicious off-dry and dessert wines. Most of the best examples of riesling come from the Finger Lakes.\n- **SEYVAL BLANC**: A major French-American hybrid that is used on its own and in blends. Can make good-tasting, dry wines.\n- **VIDAL**: A French-American hybrid; a source of dry wines and some exceptional icewines.\n- **VIGNOLES**: A somewhat rare French-American hybrid also known as Ravat 51; used for dry wines and some tasty icewines.\n\n### REDS\n- **BACO NOIR**: A French-American hybrid that makes simple, fruity red wines that aren’t particularly foxy.\n- **CABERNET FRANC**: A major grape that is often blended with merlot and cabernet sauvignon for Bordeaux-style reds.\n- **CABERNET SAUVIGNON**: Often blended with merlot to create Bordeaux-style reds. Only a modest number of producers, notably on Long Island, use it as a single varietal.\n- **CATAWBA**: A cross or hybrid (the genetic history is unclear) that was very popular in the American Northeast in the nineteenth century. It makes spicy, grapey, high-acid, light red and rosé wines.\n- **CONCORD**: A native grape belonging to the labrusca species, it was first grown from seed in Massachusetts along the Concord River. It is the most widely planted grape in New York State, although most of the production is used for grape juice and jelly, not wine. The remainder is used to make sweet kosher wines and fortified wines.\n- **MERLOT**: A major grape, merlot can become sleek, berried wines that range from good to delicious, especially those produced on Long Island.\n- **PINOT NOIR**: Generally used for New York's numerous sparkling wines.\n\nThis organized categorization of grape varieties offers an overview of the wine grape cultivation and wine production typical to New York State."
