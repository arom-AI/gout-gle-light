The one on the right is short by a full ⅛ ounce (3.75 ml).\n\n## Graduated Cylinders\n\nGraduated cylinders are tall, skinny, straight columns with milliliter volume measurements on the sides. They range from tiny 10-milliliter (about ⅓ ounce) guys to 4-liter behemoths. Graduates are very accurate. Measuring cups and beakers are sloppy by comparison. I use them for recipe development and for batching large quantities of cocktails accurately. The ones I use most are 50 ml, a little under 2 ounces, which is a good jigger replacement for fine-tuning a highly technical recipe or adding very concentrated flavors to large batches; 250 ml, a little more than 8 ounces, which is perfect for mixing up to four cocktails at a time or measuring the smaller-volume ingredients in larger batches; and 1 liter, a little more than 1 quart, for when I’m batching by the bottle. Clear unbreakable plastic versions are available at modest prices; glass ones cost more.\n\n## Micropipettes\n\nMost people won’t need one, but I really love my micropipette. Micropipettes allow you to measure a small volume of liquid very quickly and very accurately. Mine is adjustable to measure any liquid amount between 1 ml and 5 ml and is accurate to 0.1 ml. Using one takes only seconds, and unlike digital scales, micropipettes require no batteries. We use one every day at Booker and Dax for juice clarification. I also use it for recipe testing on very concentrated flavors, such as concentrated phosphoric acid or quinine sulfate."

    "contenu": "**CEREAL DOUGHS AND BATTERS**\n\n**1. General Overview about Rye Bread:**\n- Rye bread contains active enzymes that undergo browning reactions due to the presence of free sugars and amino acids.\n- The slow baking process and sugar content (approx. 20%) yield a very sweet result.\n- Unique flavors in rye bread (octenone, methional, nonenal) predominantly come from the grain itself, offering mushroom, potato, and green notes.\n- Traditional sourdough fermentation adds flavors such as fried, buttery, sweaty, and vinegary notes.\n\n**2. Sweet and Rich Breads:**\n   - Types: Brioche, Panettone, Pandoro.\n   - Characteristics: Contain substantial amounts of fat and/or sugar which pose specific baking challenges:\n     - Fat and sugar slow gluten development and weaken it by binding to water molecules and fat-loving portions of gluten.\n     - Prevents efficient bonding of gluten chains, producing a softer and more fragile dough.\n     - Doughs are usually baked inside containers to maintain shape and reduce flattening.\n     - Requires more yeast and longer rising periods due to sugar content decelerating yeast activity.\n     - Baking at relatively low temperatures to prevent early browning.\n\n**3. Gluten-Free Breads:**\n   - For people with gluten intolerance, avoiding wheat and its relatives is crucial.\n   - Gluten-free alternatives involve flours like rice flour, supplemented with xanthan gum or emulsifiers.\n   - Emulsifiers help mimic the moderating effects of gluten on dough elasticity and stability during rising and baking.\n\n**4. Other Types of Breads:**\n   - Flatbreads, bagels, steamed breads, quick breads, and doughnuts.\n   - Outside Europe and North America, there are diverse variations of oven-baked loaves.\n\n**5. Milk in Bread:**\n   - Fresh and powdered milk can be used for flavor and nutritional content in bread doughs.\n   - Precaution: Whey protein can make the dough too dense and is usually deactivated by boiling milk before use to prevent negative impacts on flour it mixes with and potential damage to the yeast's effectiveness."

    "contenu": "The document contains a glossary of terms related to wine, providing definitions for specific vocabulary used within wine culture. Here's the content structured in a text format:\n\n### GLOSSARY\n\n- **Cru**: A term for a high-quality wine from a designated appellation (e.g., _premier cru_ in a Burgundian AOC) or for certain as-yet undesignated areas seeking to emulate cru systems established elsewhere (e.g., in Italy's Piedmont).\n\n- **Cuvée**: The blending (or, in French, _assemblage_) of many wines from different years, varieties, or vineyards.\n\n- **DO and DOCa (Denominación de origen and Denominación de origen calificada)**: These are the classifications for the highest-quality Spanish wines. As with French AOC wines, regional governing bodies oversee the laws concerning such matters as minimum and maximum yields, oak and bottle aging, and grape varieties. DOCa is a recently added designation for the most limited and celebrated wines.\n\n- **DOC (Denominazione di origine controllada)**: This is the Portuguese equivalent of the Spanish DO and the French AOC wines. They are likewise tightly regulated and must adhere to strict controls on grape varieties, alcohol content, maximum yields, and, in some cases, winemaking practices.\n\n- **DOCG and DOCG (Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita and Denominazione di origine controllata e DOCG)**: The Italian equivalent of the French AOC and Spanish DO systems. DOCG wines are the most restricted and considered among the best in Italy.\n\n- **Dryness**: The amount of residual sweetness in a wine. Dryness is not the same as fruitiness, the level of fruit presence in a wine. Although ripe fruit aromas may suggest sweetness, the wine may still be dry—without perceptible sweetness—to the taste.\n\n- **Earthiness**: Flavors suggesting the earth—dust, earth, minerals, slate, gravel, forest floor, humus, and even barnyard. Many wines, especially those from western Europe, exhibit earthiness.\n\n- **Eiswein**: Literally \"ice wine,\" made from grapes that are harvested and pressed while frozen. While the best of these are made from grapes naturally frozen by cold weather, this process can be replicated by freezing grapes artificially (a process called cryoextraction).\n\n- **Finish**: Also referred to as _persistence_ or _length_, this is a measure of how long the taste of the wine can be detected in the mouth. The longer the finish, the better the wine—assuming you like the flavor!\n\n- **Flabby**: A term for wine whose weight is not balanced by sufficient acidity or tartness. A dessert wine that doesn't have adequate sharpness to foil the sweetness will be at once flabby and cloying.\n\n- **Frizzante**: The Italian term for a light sparkle (similar to French _pétillant_) that tickles the palate.\n\n- **Fruity**: The term for a wine that has abundant fruit flavors other than grape. A Töröntös may suggest citrus or tropical-fruit flavors in its aroma. A Petite Sirah may exhibit a strong aroma of blackberries or black raspberries. The younger the wine, the fruitier it's likely to be. Fruity is not synonymous with sweet.\n\n- **Grassy**: A term for many of the “green” flavors associated with wine. It may refer to the herbal character of a Verdejo or the underripe nature of an Arneis or even a Cabernet Franc.\n\n- **Green harvesting**: The practice of intentionally cutting off unripe grape bunches during the ripening stage to concentrate the flavors of the remaining fruit on the vine. The vine puts more nutrients and energy into the remaining fruit, resulting in more flavorful grapes and a smaller yield per vine.\n\n- **GSM**: A red wine consisting of a blend of Grenache, Syrah (Shiraz), and Mourvèdre.\n\n- **Ice wine**: See _Eiswein_."

    "contenu": "# Sustainable and Organic: A Farm for the Future\n\n## Introduction\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century, the movement toward eco-friendly grape-growing accelerated worldwide. \"Green viticulture,\" as it's known, generally falls under one of three concepts: sustainable, organic, or biodynamic (see box on the facing page).\n\n## Sustainable Viticulture\nSustainable viticulture is voluntarily practiced by conscientious winegrowers worldwide, with no single definition or legal requirements. Vintners decide themselves which farming practices to implement, and which to avoid, in order to create an integrated farming system capable of sustaining itself indefinitely.\n\n## Organic Viticulture\nOrganic viticulture involves growing grapes without the use of artificial fertilizers, engineered plant materials, synthetic chemicals, including pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, or soil fumigants. In many countries, vineyards and farms that meet organic standards for a period of time may subsequently be certified as having done so. \"Organic wine\" is different in the United States, for example, USDA regulations stipulate that organic wine must be made from organic grapes and, in addition, sulfites cannot be added to the wine. (Sulfites, natural antimicrobial agents, help prevent spoilage and act as a preservative.) Winemakers who grow grapes organically but use small amounts of sulfites cannot use the term _organic wine_, but can say their wine has been made with organically grown grapes.\n\n## Vine Spacing and Trellising \nThe spacing of vines, like trellising, has become a mini science that must consider the site. Historically, vines were spaced based on economics. In Europe, this often meant only as much space between the vines or rows as necessary to admit a man with a basket on his back or a horse-drawn plow. By the 1960s in California, spacing at larger intervals, usually 8 feet (2 meters) between vines and 12 feet (4 meters) between rows, allowed for the accommodation of machines and tractors, including those pulling gondolas into which the harvested grapes would be dumped.\n\n### Impact on Farming Decisions\nBut spacing has implications far beyond such simple economic issues as size or type of tractor and equipment. Closer vine spacing means more competition for soil nutrients and water. If vines are too vigorous, this competition may be beneficial, acting to slow down the vines’ growth, limit the number of grape clusters produced, and bring the vines into a better balance. The better balanced the vineyard, the better the grapes and, all things being equal, the better the wine.\n\nIn California, many new and replanted vineyards are now placed much closer together. Twenty years ago, an acre of California vineyard typically contained four hundred to six hundred or so vines. With closer planting, the range is now from six hundred to nearly three thousand vines per acre (and sometimes even more). Importantly however, the overall yield of grapes is about the same because in closely spaced vineyards, the vines are kept quite small. The goal, in other words, is not to increase yield (more on this in a moment) but rather to increase competition between vines and hence quality.\n\n## Mechanical Harvesting\nThe romantic vision of grapes lovingly picked by hand is, in many cases, just that—a romantic vision. Mechanical harvesting is used with increasing frequency throughout the world. It has both drawbacks and advantages over handpicking. First, a machine can never be as selective or careful as a person. Mechanical harvesters can break and damage the skins of grapes, as well as the vines themselves if the plants are young. Second, even though modern mechanical harvesters are calibrated to distinguish between ripe and unripe grapes, some unripe grapes and material other than grapes (MOG) still get harvested."

Today, this country supplies nearly all of the world’s crop. The fuzzy, brown-skinned Hayward kiwi was first developed in New Zealand in the 1920s, and with its sweet, tangy taste and bright green flesh dotted with tiny black seeds it is still the most popular variety today.\n\nDespite their small size, kiwis are densely packed with plenty of fibre and potassium and contain more vitamin C than an orange as well as antioxidants such as vitamin E and beta-carotene. They also contain actinidin enzymes, which are capable of digesting proteins and can cause severe allergic reactions in some people. Anyone familiar with the burning sensation that can come from eating too much kiwi has experienced the raw sting of proteases: these calcium oxalate crystals cause microscopic abrasions inside your mouth that burn when they come into contact with acid from the fruit.\n\nFresh kiwi makes an effective meat tenderizer because the actinidin enzymes in this fruit can cut through the connective tissues in meat. A little kiwi juice goes a long way: one tablespoon per 450g (1lb) of meat is the general rule of thumb when it comes to Korean barbecue marinades – too much kiwi and you end up with a mushy mess.\n\n**Related aroma profile: Kiwi berry**\nThe kiwi berry is the fruit of *Actinidia arguta*, a vine native to Japan. It looks like a miniature kiwi, with the same radial pattern of black seeds, but contains more spicy clove and caramellic aroma molecules, giving it a sweeter taste. The lack of fuzz makes it a perfect superfood snack.\n\n### Side Column\n**Title: Kivirė**\n**Location: Sang-Hoon Degeimbre, L'Air du Temps, Belgium**\n\n**Description:**\nFew people might notice a subtle marine-like fragrance when they eat kiwi, but those green, grassy-scented aldehydes were what initially led to the genesis of Foodpairing and chef Sang-Hoon Degeimbre’s classic kiwi and oyster pairing, the *kivirė* – a raw oyster served over taro, tangy bites of diced kiwi, accompanied by crunchy croutons and finished with a velvety coconut cream infused with fresh lime juice.\n\n### Related Items Table\n\n| Item          | Pan-fried quail | Hazelnut | Purple sage | Baked king scallop | Aji amarillo chili | Dry-aged beef | Boiled pumpkin | Black garlic puree | Usukuchi (light soy sauce) | Basil |\n|---------------|:---------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------------:|:-----:|\n| **Kiwi berry**|        🟢        |    🟡      |      🟢       |          🟢        |          🟢        |      🟢       |       🟢        |          🟡         |               🟡           | 🟢    |\n\n--- \n\nThis structured content captures the details regarding kiwis and a highlighted delicacy as presented within the document."

Here is the detailed content, categorized by types of tequila and their descriptions:\n\n### Blanco Tequilas\n\n#### Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila\n- Description: A favorite for cocktails, known for its clean, dry, and well-balanced flavor with an honest, pure agave taste. It is especially good as a base spirit for chili pepper infusions.\n\n#### Siete Leguas Blanco Tequila\n- Description: Produced in one of Mexico's oldest distilleries, which is the source of the Patron brand. It is made from agave roasted in a stone oven and is highlighted by sharp fruit, spice, and floral notes. It is effective even when used as part of a split base.\n\n### Platinum Tequila\n\n#### El Tesoro Platinum Tequila\n- Description: Regarded as the gold standard of highlands blanco tequila. It sets benchmarks for new blanco tequilas showing quality with a mix of fresh grassiness and deep, long-lasting fruit notes.\n\n### Reposado Tequilas\n\n#### El Tesoro Reposado Tequila\n- Description: Favored for its combination of body and bright agave notes blended with spices, and flavors derived from barrel aging. It is full-bodied and can stand against a strong mezcal, specifically in a Oaxaca Old-Fashioned cocktail.\n\n#### Siete Leguas Reposado Tequila\n- Description: Esteemed for maintaining the core aspects of its blanco variant with added depth through careful aging in oak, which softens and enriches the flavor.\n\n### Añejo Tequila\n\n#### El Tesoro Añejo Tequila\n- Description: Aged two years in oak, resulting in an aromatic and intensely flavored spirit. It includes spice and vanilla notes not typically found in younger tequilas. Used primarily in stirred drinks such as Coraillo and Te Amo, and in shaken drinks like Dolores Park Swizzle.\n\n### Mezcal\n\n- Overview: Explained as an overarching category for all spirits made from agave, with tequila being a specific type of mezcal produced near Tequila city. Mezcal is distinct from tequila by its smoky flavor due to the underground cooking of agave and showcases the unique flavors of different agave varietals.\n\nThe section on mezcal complements the detailed tequila descriptions by providing a broader context for understanding the differences and processing methods of agave-based spirits."

    "contenu": "# Understanding Wines: Explaining Style and Quality\n\n## Germany\nGermany is renowned for producing an extraordinarily high concentration of world-class Rieslings. These wines vary from dry, steely, to medium-sweet and floral, and even to lusciously sweet varieties. However, German winemaking also excels in other varieties such as the increasingly popular Spätburgunder, known for its premium quality.\n\n### Climate and Grape Growing\nGerman wine regions typically have a cool, continental climate, making them different even within the country. For instance, Baden experiences notably warmer summers and has an agricultural timetable shifted by this increased warmth, ensuring wines can retain their acidity despite full ripeness being achieved.\n\nSeveral factors influence German viticulture:\n- **Geographical aspects:** The topography allows for varied sunshine exposure and beneficial warmth.\n- **Human interventions:** Labor-intensive methods like hand-work on very steep slopes ensure optimal grape exposure and quality.\n- **Protective measures:** Measures like geographical placement near rivers aid in mitigating frost damages.\n\n### Wine Processing\nThe classification of wines in Germany is often dependent on several detailed measurements and practices such as:\n- **Must weight:** Helps determine the style class of the wine.\n- **Repeated picking:** Allows for selective harvesting of grapes at optimal ripeness.\n- **Sorting:** Critical for ensuring quality in finished wines.\n\n### Grape Varieties and Wine Styles\nGermany is not only known for Rieslings but also other varieties that adapt well to local market needs and international preferences.\n- **Predominant Wine Styles:** Dry Rieslings are identified as **Qualitätsweine**, whereas richer, fruitier versions reach designation as **Prädikatsweine**.\n- **Notable Mention:** Other varieties also achieving recognition under Prädikatsweine.\n\n#### Specific Varieties Highlighted:\n- **Riesling:** Most widely planted, it varies significantly from region to region due to microclimate variances. Styles range from delicate and floral to rich and sweet.\n- **Classification and Labeling:** German Wine Laws provide rigid classification, from broader **Qualitätsweine** to precise **Prädikatsweine**.\n\n### Specialty Wines:\n- **Kabinett:** This specific style of Riesling Prädikatsweine is noted for its delicate and lighter attributes compared to other sweetness classes.\n\nThis document provides an in-depth understanding of German wines, focusing on the diversity offered by variations in climate, grape cultivation, and precision in the winemaking process. The meticulous approach to grape growing and wine classification in Germany underscores their commitment to quality and specificity in wine production."

The recipe details the ingredients and instructions for making a pastry crust, marmalade filling, and a final topping. Below is a breakdown of the structured content of the recipe, including sections for the crust, marmalade, filling, and topping.\n\n### Citrus Marmalade Tart\n\n**Serves:** 8\n\n---\n\n#### Pastry for Crust and Lattice:\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - 2½ cups all-purpose flour\n  - 6 tablespoons sugar\n  - Pinch of salt\n  - 12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) chilled unsalted butter, diced\n  - 5 tablespoons ice water, or as needed\n\n#### Marmalade:\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - 3 to 4 large navel oranges, or 6 blood oranges, or 4 blood oranges and 4 Meyer lemons\n  - ½ cup sugar\n  - Juice of 1 lemon\n  - ½ cup water\n\n#### Filling:\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - 1 cup sugar\n  - 3 tablespoons cornstarch\n  - 4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, room temperature\n  - 3 eggs\n  - 3 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur\n\n#### Topping:\n- **Ingredients:**\n  - 1 cup whipping cream\n  - 2 tablespoons sugar\n  - 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur\n\n---\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n**For the pastry:**\n1. Blend the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor to combine.\n2. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal.\n3. Gradually mix in the ice water by tablespoonfuls until the dough comes together.\n4. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and form into two flattened discs, one slightly larger than the other.\n5. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour. (The dough can be made up to 2 days ahead of time. Keep refrigerated.)\n\n**For the marmalade:**\n1. Wash and dry the oranges.\n2. With a sharp peeler, carefully remove all of the zest from all the fruit and finely chop enough zest to measure about 1 cup.\n3. Cut away any white pith from the fruit.\n4. Separate the fruit into segments and peel off the outer membrane from enough segments to measure 3 cups of citrus pulp.\n5. In a medium saucepan, combine the pulp, ½ cup sugar, juice of 1 lemon, and ½ cup water.\n6. Proceed with further steps typically involving cooking the mixture until thickened.\n\n(No further instructions are given on the document for completing the filling and topping, but usually, the filling would be cooked and the topping whipped before assembling the tart.)"

    "contenu": "The document contains two images:\n\n1. The top image features a sketched illustration of a few grapes and a pear. One grape, depicted with a face, is seemingly thinking or speaking the word \"Freitag\" (which translates to \"Friday\" in English).\n\n2. The bottom image is a more intricate and framed illustration with the text:\n   - \"GEHEIMER RAT\"\n   - \"Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan\"\n   - \"JESUITENGARTEN GG\"\n   - \"2011\"\n   \n   The illustration shows two classical figures, potentially scenes from mythology or allegory, engaged in an activity around what appears to be a grapevine, reflecting themes possibly related to winemaking or vineyard management.\n\nBoth images appear to be related to wine, indicated by the presence of grapes in both and the likely vineyard context of the bottom image, along with references that suggest a prestigious or historic wine-related branding or product, especially with the mention of a specific vintage year (2011)."
